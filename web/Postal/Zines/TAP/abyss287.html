<br>
A Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all. It seems in this holiday
season I've had an abnormally large number of conversations with many of you
about the pressures of the holiday. Remembering a few simple things can make it
all a lot easier..... there are lots of ways to celebrate what still (let's
face it everyone, and I say that even as a Christian) is fundamentally a pagan
Winter Solstice holiday. To me this means a couple of things, first that you
need to celebrate it, no matter what your thoughts are on how. It also means
that you need to find the ways that make you feel good and warm and happy, and
arrange to find ways to do those things. Why spend lots of energy and effort
doing things you don't like? For me, I don't send Christmas cards except for
those on which I have the time to write personal notes. This doesn't mean that
I don't love getting cards from many of you, including from many of you family
pictures and those neat holiday letters, but I'm not going to do it. I spend
enough on postage sending these szines, anyway! So this is your Christmas card,
for all of you!! I also like to do lots of singing around the holidays, so that
takes up a lot of my energy and attention. But this always is an especially
happy time of the year for me, and we finally got more snow on the ground!! I
hope it is for you as well and that you can find the ways to make it joyous for
you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><br>
<br>
Yes, we're also late again! I pushed the deadlines back to compensate. Running
a close second to discussions with many of you about the holidays was
discussion about politics and spending tax money. I don't want to go on about
that issue either, but I'm thinking again about some of the basic rules of
fiscal and personal responsibility.... if you're buying things for yourself,
you care a lot about what you're buying and how much it costs, this is why it
is best to give people money and let them buy what they want, if at all
possible. Then there is when you buy things to give them to other people, when
you care very much about what it costs, like paying taxes, but you don't worry
enough about what you're buying. Then, when you are given money that belongs to
other people, to buy things for yourself, you might overspend a bit, but you
will care about what you're buying. It seems to me that giving Iraqi fighting
units the budgets would get them buying the right armor for their vehicles.....
but not for the last case, giving other people's money to people who are buying
things for other people. This is the case of contractors, who tend to overspend
for poor quality. In this sense, I don't understand (in the public good sense)
why we should be contracting out services quite so much to the private sector,
when we can't give proper oversight to the contracts, and the contractors are
spending our money, buying things for other people, not necessarily at high
quality. I think some priorities are a bit screwed up here. And the other
lesson is about borrowing money to buy things, if we borrow money from people
in other countries to buy things, then in that sense we don't own it, they do.
Do you want people in other countries to own our Social Security Trust Fund?
Maybe, since it's a good deal if they will go for it, but remember they will
own it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><!--hboxt-->I'm about to start
putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, starting with someone who SHOULD
be relatively easy to find, since he's been &quot;around&quot; in recent years,
and then working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find culminating in the
300th issue person whom I already have in mind. So, let's really find John,
I'll be shocked if you can't do it, and it's worth fifty bucks!!! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Feel free to spend the time looking
for some of the backlog. Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new &quot;search for&quot; every five issues. Moreover,
you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous target who went unfound in
the original $50 period. That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom
Hurst or Bill Quinn or Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose is
&quot;found&quot; from now on it is worth $25. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Winners will receive credit for Dip
hobby activities that I will pay out as requested by the winner. Subscribe to
szines here or abroad, run your own contests, publish a szine, finance a web
page, GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever. Spend it all right away or use
me as a bank to cover hobby activities for years. What must you do to win? Get
me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're searching for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>This is very important, just
finding them doesn't do it. They have to write me a letter. The final judge as
to the winner of any contest will be the target himself and I reserve the right
to investigate the winning entry. When you find someone I'm looking for, you
should ask him to send me a letter for print that includes a verification of
who &quot;found&quot; him. </p>

the US wants to get money into Euros, we'll try to help you out. Ronald Camstra
can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl and his home address is:
Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands. But in Holland it is most
common not to send checks but to transfer money by bank. Dutch people can pay
directly to Postbankaccount 4652247 of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. Since he can
see the name and address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to
mention the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank
order. Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan. If you're interested
in playing that game internationally by mail, I think Ronald can help you out. </p>

office of the International Subscription Exchange in Australia!! Brendan Whyte,
the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i> will be doing
the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who was the Australian
rep for many years. You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from
the US or to sub to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars
into American ones. We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps
as well. You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au (note that this
is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at: Map

relatively new address adjustment. </p>

several games came pretty close. Initial feedback regarding our scoring system
was extremely positive from both new players and veterans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>We gave out a ton of awards
throughout the weekend, including as games went on. A Death Cup was awarded to
the first eliminated in each game, and &quot;scandalous&quot; and
&quot;crazed&quot; play was recognized. We also kept a running tally of units
being destroyed and where they were popped. Con, Bul, and Vie tied with 4 units
destroyed each; a total of 54 units were destroyed in 8 games. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>We're already beginning planning to
make next year's tournament bigger and better, tentative dates are Oct 28-30,

<b>Larry Peery (Fri, 24 Dec 2004 18:47:30 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Greetings! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>And Merry Christmas to you who
celebrate that holiday. And to all, everywhere, Happy New Year and a peaceful
2005 to all of us! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Ship launchings and sea trials are
never easy. The Swedish Vasa, Japanese Shinano and the Queen Mary 2, to name
just three, immediately come to mind. Still, although things don't always go
smoothly, progress is made. Things do happen. Current events become history.
And we move on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>So it has been with plans for Dip
At Sea V/DipCon XXXVIII. Actually the plan has worked very well. It's execution
has been a bit rough in spots but that's not unusual with any DipCon. And
considering the unique nature of this one, I think we're doing quite well, all
things considered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>If all those who have committed to
the event follow through this weekend, I believe we will achieve our initial
group goal of eight cabins. Actually, we will over-achieve that goal, but some
people have booked independently, so their booking doesn't count toward the
group goal. We must have eight cabins booked through Valet Travel to secure the
group booking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>If we don't, it's not a big
disaster, it just means the cruise is going to cost a bit more, but it would be
nice to pull it off since it will increase our leverage with Carnival for
future events and improve the quality of this one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>What I want to point out to all of
you is the very different make-up of this event. It's a much more family-oriented
event than past North American DipCons. It's also a much more hobby-oriented
event, with non-American participants nearly as numerous as North Americans.
David Norman is of the opinion that his and Yann's participation exhausts the
potential for overseas attendance. I disagree. We'll see who is right </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Chris Martin has created a scoring
system for the event that is....Well, it's like all past scoring systems. If
you win, you'll love it. If you don't, you'll blame it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Steve Cooley, the third member of our
Committee, is busy with his cohorts and officials at the Altun Ha site,
creating a Mayan cultural version of Richard Wagner's The Ring. All he would
say for publication was, &quot;David Norman is going to look so good when we
toss him off the top of the pyramid into the bowl of peeriblah below!!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Ry4an Brase, bless his heart, had
the nerve to over-rule me and did I object? Hell no! He knows more than I do
about just about everything, so how could I object. After all, he's going to be
paying my old age Social Security benefits in .... Never mind. He's doing a
great job for us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>All of you who have emailed/talked
with Barb at Valet Travel have had nothing but good words for her. I expected
nothing less. What's amazing has been her tolerance for us. I'm sure we're the
most difficult group she's ever handled. I just hope we can drum up enough
attendees to bring her along as a guest, or give her another DipCon project to
work on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>And yes, there will be a Dip At Sea
VI. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>So, on this Christmas Eve/Christmas
Day/Boxing Day, etc. relax. Enjoy the holiday. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I look forward, port, and
starboard, to seeing all of you on March 6 aboard the Elation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>For those who prefer the train,
Washington D.C.'s (http://www.unionstationdc.com/) Union Station, is also just
a few Metro stops from the hotel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Would you rather drive-find I-95
and drive north or south as appropriate. You won't be able to miss D.C., and
the traffic on the Beltway will give you plenty of time to admire the sights! </p>

good to see the latest <i>TAP</i>, as I hadn't heard from you since Game 3 of
the WS. I had suspected that you were caught up in the rapture, or the New
England die-off (&quot;If I could just see the Red Sox win it once before I
die...&quot;), or just still drunk and wandering the streets outside Fenway
with Rick Desper, who I haven't heard from either. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Rick Desper (rick_desper of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: As I said, I feared that you

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Nor me, but it took a LONG
time to wear down to a dull roar of general pleasure!))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: On Monday I caught the tail
end of an interview with new NASCAR champ Kurt Busch, who I think was answering
questions on a conference call with lots of local reporters from various parts
of the country. He appeared to be talking to a Chicago writer, and my ears
picked up about the time when he said something like, &quot;...yeah, the Red
Sox win, I win, it's gotta be the Cubs' turn next year...&quot;. Apparently he
grew up in Las Vegas with WGN-TV and Harry Carey, so he's a fan. I can picture
him throwing out the first pitch, or singing &quot;Take Me Out to the
Ballgame&quot; durning the 7th inning stretch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Rick: How can anybody named
&quot;Busch&quot; be a Cubs fan? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: Good point. I don't think
they're related to the brewing crew, but you'd think they'd get some kind of
marketing tie in. As it is, his car will be sponsored by Crown Royal next year.
Go figure. His little brother will also be driving at the top level next year,
but will have Kellogg's as a sponsor. Of course, at 20, he's not old enough to
drink yet... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Yawn..... yeah, I suppose
there was some excitement, but Busch seemed to wrap it up almost TOO easily, at
least as much as I was paying attention, which was as little as possible.))</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: The election was on the 2nd,
and I think it was the 6th before I didn't hear anything about it on the news,
which is kinda sad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Rick: Do what I do: ignore the TV
news. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: What's worse is that a story
with a much longer shelf life is going to be the ugly incident in the
Pacers-Pistons game of the 19th. Right now it's 5 days past, and still front
page, and not just in the Sports' section. I lost my interest for the NBA in
the '80s, but you can't avoid this story, and I've tried. Let's hope something
good comes from this, other than the fact that Ron Artest now has a lot of time
to promote his rap album. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Rick: A perhaps good effect would
be if the Pacers could continue to play well without the three stars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: 3-1 at last count. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Rick: The NBA has become
unwatchable in recent years, due largely to the Stern-backed idea of marketing
players over teams. That worked when MJ was playing, but MJ is not reappearing
any time soon, no matter how much the NBA would like Vince Carter, or Kobe
Bryant, or Tracy McGrady to be &quot;the next Michael Jordan&quot;. It is
likely that the next great NBA player will be nothing like Jordan. And, when
that happens, it will be a Good Thing. I'm hoping that, before that happens,
some NBA team will follow the Pats' example and start emphasizing team play
more than individual play. It really is a good way to make a winning team. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: I don't follow the NBA all
that much, but didn't this happen with Detroit last year? Last I checked,
Seattle was doing it this year... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Yeah, that's about right, I'm
actually starting to follow the NBA more than a little bit again. I may regret
it, but I am. I like how Doc Rivers is slowly building up the Celtics, we'll
see if Danny Ainge let's him play out this string. Rivers is a master at
maximizing the wins AND the learning AND the engagement of all the players.
It's fun to watch, even when they lose.))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: That's it from a red county in
a blue state. Hope all is well there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Rick: Thought you were a Hoosier
for some reason. Where are you? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Goz: For 20 years I *was* a
Hoosier. In '02 I went and got married, and she lived in Toledo, so I went
there. No job, but I got one in the Chicago area in '03, where we both grew up.
So we're about 40 miles west of downtown, about 4 miles west of the house I
grew up in, and about 150 yards east of where the farms start. You're now
caught up. How goes it in, um, Maryland? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I agree with Brux that the bonus is
bad. If there must be an advantage to early entry, it should come in the form
of a different entry fee. That way early entries have better payout odds, but
you still have the purity of the best guess winning. This year, it made no
difference, because the one guy got all but Iowa and didn't need his bonus. If
someone had gotten all 50 states right but still lost to someone else who missed
a few but got the bonus, that would have seemed wrong to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>(small-time local-band) REVIEW:
Marian Tewksbury and the Mercury Blues, 19 November 2004, Cyber Cafe West,
Binghamton, New York </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Want to have more fun and make less
money than anyone? Join a blues band in a city where most people are white and
the rest are under 25. Binghamton (&quot;five hours northwest of the other
Hamptons&quot;) is that kind of city; nevertheless, Marian Tewksbury has been
playing blues locally for a bunch of years. Most recently she was with the
Riolo Brothers Blues Band, which I cited in Issue 281: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/abyss281.html
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>for the best half-concert of music
I'd heard in '04 through June. (I showed up late on 10 April.) When she split
with that band, she decided to form her own band and play with her daughter.
Mary played lead guitar with a young rock and blues band before she was old
enough to buy a drink, so she wasn't unqualified to join her mother. (I heard
them play once, and they were better than the seedy little bar they were in.)
They added drummer Victor Lay and bass player Jim Saxby, and they're coming
together into a good band that will soon be an excellent band. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>Cool, I most defnitely agree.
These types of local blues bands are all over Providence too, and have been for
years. Many of the musicians and bands from them also have made something of a
national splash as well (e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;Duke Robillard, Roomful of Blues).))</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>This was actually their second
concert that I heard. The previous weekend, they played at a Binghamton
coffeehouse called La Tazza (being next to where the Tasmanian Embassy
live-music bar, &quot;the Taz&quot;, used to rule), and it was a good show but
raw, so I decided to review this 19-Nov show at the Cyber. The Mercury Blues do
two styles of show: acoustic and electric, varying mainly on Marian's primary
guitar type. At La Tazza, they did an acoustic show, further differentiated by
the use of a set of Afro-Caribbean drums that were on hand. I really liked
them; Victor used them well in creating a more organic, less sharp sound and
feel that worked well with everything from the ballads to the most rockin'
songs. The coffeehouse owners and regulars said it was the biggest crowd they'd
had in there since it opened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>With that fun show as preparation,
I knew I'd enjoy the show at Cyber Cafe West (www dot cybercafewest dot com).
Owner Jeff Katz has supported live music for years, hosting singer-songwriter
folkies and blues bands and jazz bands and other acts that don't draw much of a
crowd in this area. I've heard music with less than a dozen people in the
place; but instead of quitting or booking pop bands, Jeff keeps going and even
plays guitar himself in the Thursday night Grateful Dead jams. His &quot;West
Fest&quot; in the back lot in the summer, thirteen bands in two days, raised a
bunch of money for Project Headstart, since the government spent it on wars and
tax breaks instead. So I support the Cyber's efforts when I can. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>The Mercury Blues started with a
rather loaded stage for a quartet: five electric lead guitars and electric
basses, a miked acoustic guitar, a regular rock/jazz-style drum/cymbal kit, and
at least a couple of harmonicas. They did a fair amount of switching
instruments. The material was wide-ranging but I thought most songs were quite
good choices, tunes that I was happy to hear. It wasn't just a rerun of the La
Tazza show; in fact they had learned seven new songs in the intervening weeks.
I knew almost every song; even one of Marian's originals was familiar from
Riolo Brothers shows and the one at La Tazza. It was quite enjoyable, overall.
Everybody contributed some great sections, and their support work under each
other's leads showed they'd gained from the rehearsal time together. Mostly
blues from Robert Johnson through the 1964-ish white bands, and some rock
through about 1970 that mostly developed from the previous category. Diverse
enough song selection to keep it from ever getting one-sound. To wit (and I may
have errors in these unresearched notes): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((I'm also going to let you go
with this for the most part, though I could jump in on a few of the historical
references. Other readers are invited to pop back in with comments. But, let me
just say a little bitty about Robert Johnson. Any music lover in general, and
especially and blues/rock lover owes it to themselves to go listen to Robert
Johnson in the original. Every ten years or so, you get a lot of publicity
about this, and I've been hearing such a wave lately, for some reason. Robert
Johnson was a desperately poor musician who could do things with a guitar to whale
the blues out of it that no one before or since really can do with the same
depth of feeling. He also had a pretty horrible personal life, on which he
could draw greatly. He died pretty much in obscurity, but some people managed
to record a few of his songs. They were pretty much lost for about thirty
years, until they were resurrected for the first time in the 1960's. Then you
had people like the Stones, Clapton, and just about anybody who ever had a
thought in that period of popularizing the blues listening avidly and learning
from Robert Johnson. Really the most damnably amazing story in that sense in
all 20th Century music.))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>SET 1: &quot;I Know You
Rider&quot;, an old (Thirties?) blues number that the Grateful Dead often
played in concert as a groove tune; &quot;So Long&quot;, I don't know who wrote
this but it sounds like B.B. King material; &quot;Why Don't You Do Right&quot;,
an older song (Forties?) that Peggy Lee popularized as a mainstream vamp;
&quot;Feelin' Alright&quot;, which was underappreciated until Joe Cocker
covered it at Woodstock, and it's been a favorite of the Dead and groove bands
ever since; &quot;For Your Love&quot;, the Yardbirds; &Ouml;ver the Rainbow&quot;,
Neil Young; an original which I think is titled &quot;Mercury Blues&quot;,
mostly a Marian song but Jim played absolutely dynamite harmonica, ambrosia to
my ears; and &quot;Red House&quot;, Jimi Hendrix. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>(Mary obviously hates singing
repetitious backup vocals, so I taunted her with a cuecard during &quot;For
Your Love&quot;, consisting of only the title... it's her only line in the
song, repeated a bunch.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>SET 2: &quot;You Can't Always Get
What You Want&quot;, the Rolling Stones; &quot;Crossroads&quot;, Robert Johnson
(and much later a Clapton hit); &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;, Santana;
&quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, the Animals had a hit with this but
I think it's a decade or two older; &quot;You Don't Have to Go&quot; (I forget
whether this was the Muddy Waters classic or something else, I have
&quot;Stones&quot; written down in my notes); &quot;When I Lost My Baby&quot;,
I'm not sure where this one comes from, but I loved Marian's slide guitar work;
&quot;Stormy Monday&quot;, with guest vocalist Sylvia Hart in to do the
crooning, and a first-class job of it; &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot;,
Steppenwolf; &quot;A Million Miles&quot;, Neil Young; and &quot;Last Dance with
Mary Jane&quot;, Tom Petty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>SET 3: &quot;Spoonful&quot;, Willie
Dixon (one of the most often recorded songs in history, despite its topic);
&quot;Love Me Like a Man&quot;, popularized in country music, with Sylvia
sitting in again (with a smooth seductive voice like a golden dress and long
gloves); &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, probably Bob Dylan's best guitar
tune, later covered by Jimi Hendrix; &quot;Rockin' in the Free World&quot;,
Neil Young; and another original, probably titled &quot;I Can't Find No
Love&quot;, featuring Marian's slide guitar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Granted, for somebody like me who
knew the songs, there were little misses and rough spots in places, but never
enough to ruin a song. They're a new band so I gave them the occasional
mulligan; soon they won't need that. Everything was fun, and it would have been
worth a medium ticket price. Since they're a new band, the Cyber only charged
three bucks, so it was a bargain. I'll hear them again. They say Mary learns
new songs quickly; considering she played the majority of the leads on Santana
and Hendrix numbers, we're not talking about simple guitar work. The rest have
much longer experience but they're still learning to play together, including
different instrument combinations. Jim should develop more of that sweet
flowing crying harmonica; I never get to hear enough of that. Marian should
keep writing originals. I predict they'll be one of the best bands in the area
(and maybe even get recognized as such) within a year. </p>

<b>Bob Osuch (Tue, 23 Nov 2004 00:11:58 EST)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Hello J-B, I feel obliged to
congratulate you on the World Series triumph for the Bosox. It comes around so
seldom, you should savor the moment as long as possible. While many of my
connections (Detroit) have won championships over the years, I have witnessed
what not doing so decade after decade (Chicago) can do to the psyche of a
community. Well, they did have the Bulls in the nineties, but this newer
version is maintaining the status quo nicely, thank you. As of this writing
they have yet to win a game. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Yeah, they are pretty
pathetic. They're doing little better now. I am indeed savoring it. I am
finding much less tension involved in the off-season dealings, and for the free
agents the Red Sox have, I mostly have the feeling, if you're back great, but
if you want to take the money and run, be my guest. I do hope that they resign
Pedro and Tek (likely at this writing), but even with them, I feel the same
way. The feelings in the area vary, the &quot;depression of winter&quot; is
such a thing around here, that many people are dealing with this new feeling in
different ways. I've heard people speaking in the same old patterns, but this
is a shame. For them, they've already gotten past the success.))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>So another year ends and already
the free agent wheels are turning. My Tigers signed Percival and have decided
to keep Urbina for the time being, so at least the bullpen looks better. I'm
not all that encouraged, however, due to the mediocrity of their starting
pitching. Jeremy Bonderman is the ace there. 'Nuff said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>On the home front, it looks like
Mags is history. Sad, because the Chisox traded away their top prospect,
outfielder Jeremy Reed, to Seattle in the Garcia deal along with Miguel Olivo.
So now they are stuck with no real catcher and a very thin outfield. Add no
shortstop to the mix (they dumped Valentin) and it all adds up to a long 2005
on the South side. <i>((Yes, I heard that they tried to sneak into the Randy
Johnson sweepstakes, but were turned down flat. My opinion is that Johnson will
stay in Arizona, they've even made some efforts to otherwise improve that team.
The Diamondbacks, for one, will do better than the Chisoz this year, I think.))</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>The Cubs look no better. There was
a lot of bickering between the players and the TV announcers (Chip Caray and
Steve Stone) all year long over what Stone felt was the inexcusably stupid play
of Baker's Boyzz. Stone felt, rightly so, that the Cubs hitters were unwilling
to work the count and were too intent on swinging for the fences. Throw in a
ton of baserunning gaffes, fielding fiascos and off field antics and you have
the formula for a team in disarray. The fact that Sosa and Farnsworth chose not
to suit up for the final game speaks volumes on the lack of control Baker had
over the inmates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Clement and Alou are gone, and it
looks like Grudzielanek as well. There doesn't seem to be any urgency to sign
Nomar, even tho he played well when he was able. Oh, and Stoney and Caray won't
be back (sigh). Bob Brenly has already signed a deal as the new color man. No
word yet on the pbp guy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Well, you now have Nomar, he
should REALLY be trying hard to get back into the elite shortstops, but no one
seems that excited.... least of all Nomar.))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>They still have a nice nucleus.
Just no chemistry. They need to make some serious moves to contend next year,
and they will probably do so. Should be interesting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>The upcoming draft for fantasy
league guys in keeper leagues and those of us in computer leagues is
horrendous, especially in the AL. The worst in recent memory. You have Mauer
and Upton and they both have question marks, Mauer over his knee and Upton over
his inability to field a position. The aforementioned Jeremy Reed and Alexis
Rios are worth second looks, Greinke and Bush look like solid pitchers, but it
thins out real quick. Good luck finding someone in the second round. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Boardman sent me a sample of his
zeen. Don't know why I'm worthy after close to 30 years. I found it interesting
but way too political for my tastes. Now that we chose four more years of
George W, well, what more is there to say. We made our bed, now we will lie in
it. But let's not rub our faces in it if we don't have to, because somebody
soiled the sheets! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I see Bruce Mount and Adam
Silverman both made the final board in the World Dip Tourney. Bruce was the AOL
Diplomacy Club Forum Host when I was the Archivist. Adam was a very active
player there. I had the pleasure of playing in a game once with Adam and he was
one of the stronger diplomats I ever encountered. They both have their own
Dip-related web sites...if you're interested I'll get you the addresses. <i>((I
have Adam's, I also know Adam really well, but I'd be interested in seeing
Bruce Mount's, whom I don't know. See above for more on Adam and the tournament
he and Edi Birsan organized....))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>The AOL Club is now in a state of
flux due to a variety of factors. AOL hasn't helped matters by constantly
altering the &quot;groups&quot; areas and eliminating our keyword. I have
stepped down from my duties there but wish them well. I believe Bruce has
called it quits also, but I'm not positive. I do know that they are seriously
considering severing their ties with AOL. </p>

view on this still is simple. It was NOT illegal in baseball terms (some of

and this may finally be the push to get baseball to clean up its act.)) <o:p></o:p></i></p>

self-righteousness in retrospect doesn't become anyone. They started out not

amazing player, steroids or no steroids. And there too, naivete is rampant.
Everyone SHOULD have known that SOME kind of performance enhancement was going

slowly been looked at, well, you had the &quot;test year&quot; with an amazingly
large number of players testing positive given that they knew it was coming,
they didn't test for everything, and it was done with foreknowledge, not
surprise testing. And now, the current rule is barely more than parking ticket
strength. Everyone in baseball has been playing under the same rules, those
rules might be seen as stupid or inept, but they was the rules. Now perhaps
there will be new rules....)) <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Oh yes, one other thing that's
been getting lots of play out this way is Billy's efforts to break up the big
three.... looks to the Boston/Providence sportswriters that there is no useful
interest in Zito, but Mulder and Hudson are likely to be moved. The Red Sox are
said to be competitive for Hudson if the deal with Atlanta that Beane is working
on now falls through. You would get Arroyo and a second baseman most likely,
plus some lower level prospects.)) <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((LATER POSTSCRIPT: Correct that
they both were traded, but wrong that the Red Sox ever had much chance for
either. The steal for the Red Sox was Wade Miller and getting Matt Clement
won't be too bad either. Even David Wells is a good deal for the money. The Red
Sox are moving in a Beane like direction in that way. You can count on the fact
that Mulder and Hudson won't be as good as what Beane got for them. Now, here's
a few more recent thoughts from Mark....))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><br>
<br>
<b>Mark D Lew (Thu, 9 Dec 2004 17:35:53 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>&quot;Efforts to break up the big
three&quot;? That's a weird way of putting it. Breaking them up requires no
effort. That happens naturally when their contracts run out. Keeping them
together would require effort. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>My take is that Billy is just
listening to offers as usual. If someone offers up that we like even better
than Hudson, then sure he'll take it, but if your local sportswriters are
taking the position that Beane is eager to unload Hudson to save payroll, I
think they're sadly mistaken. One year of Hudson at around $7m is still a
pretty good deal. It's not a contract we need to get rid of. If Hudson is
traded, it'll only be because we get an even better collection of players in
return. Otherwise, we may as well use him for one more year and then let him go
after that, which is the team's usual habit (eg, Giambi, Tejada). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>When you say Mulder and Hudson
&quot;are likely to be moved&quot;, do you mean now?? I think people are
confused on this. If you're talking about no re-signing them when their
contracts run out, sure. I think there's a very good chance that *none* of the
three will stay with Oakland. But that's an entirely different question from
whether they need to be traded *before* their contracts are up. We've got
Mulder for two more years at about $6m/yr. That's a bargain. Why would anyone
try to get rid of that? Is someone under the impression that Oakland is in
fire-sale mode? We certainly aren't. There'll be more dealing, but it's not
like we're breaking up the team. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((I agree, but I just note that
they WERE in fact traded, you can't go against me while I'm on the &quot;Red
Sox roll&quot;.....))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I think the winter meetings just
started, so maybe there's a new news story I haven't seen yet. I'll have to
check on that. Otherwise I think Billy is just trying to start a bidding war
over Hudson to see if anyone is sucker enough to offer the moon for him. If so,
we take it and run. Otherwise we keep Hudson for 05 and let him go after that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I also wouldn't be surprised if
Beane is using Hudson as a way to scare up information about what's out there.
After the Kendall trade, I do think Beane is looking to move *someone*, but not
necessarily a starting pitcher. I think Byrnes and Bradford are definitely
available, and Hatteberg or even Durazo if someone is interested. It all
depends on which one Beane can get a good deal for, I think. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>If you've got a specific source on
serious discussions of Hudson to Boston (or even Atlanta), please point me to
it so I can follow up. I know about Atlanta. Beane wants Marcus Giles plus
something, and Atlanta is probably Hudson's first choice of where to go, so I know
they're talking about that, but ultimately I think Atlanta won't offer enough.
As for Boston, I think that's just some local writer's vivid imagination. I see
plenty of trade talk like that from the Oakland fans - insisting on blathering
on and on about trading for some player whom the other team has no intention of
letting go of. </p>

<b>Mark D Lew (Thu, 9 Dec 2004 18:28:51 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I'm catching up with the buzz now.
It's like election day all over again. As far as I can tell, Dan Patrick
reported that a St Louis radio station reported that a deal for Hudson was
imminent. Somehow that got slightly misrepresented as saying that *ESPN*
reporting that the trade was imminent, and when no one could figure out what St
Louis would have to offer Oakland, someone imagined it as a three-way with
Atlanta. That's more plausible, since Oakland really is talking with Atlanta,
but then it begs the question of why St Louis is involved at all. Anyway, it
turns out that the St Louis radio station was wrong, and now the Cardinals have
told ESPN that a deal is NOT imminent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I think Beane just wants to be the
middle of the universe during the winter meetings. He's playing up Hudson so
that everyone will be talking to him. Ultimately, he probably doesn't trade
Hudson at all, but something will come out of all the talk - very likely
something that is nothing like what the sportswriters are contemplating right
now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>By the way, I don't see Boston as
being one of the primary contenders here. For one thing, both Beane and Hudson
prefer that Hudson ends up in the NL. </p>

<b>Mark D Lew (Sat, 11 Dec 2004 01:32:45 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Weekend is starting now. For what
it's worth my guess is that Beane entertains a whole heck of a lot of offers
for Hudson but in each case he asks for more than the team is willing to give.
Hudson plays in Oakland for 2005, and then leaves as a free agent. After the
famous &quot;ultimatum&quot; Hudson gave insisting he be told what the team's
intentions are, I think Billy told him something like this: &quot;I'm not
really looking to trade you, but I'm going to dangle you out there and see what
the offers are and if one is really good I'll take it. We'd like to re-sign you
but realistically we probably can't afford you at the price you're worth. I
don't want to close the door on that yet, because after all the trades work out
we'll have a better idea of what sort of budget we have left.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>But I do think he does one or more
other big deals. I think there's a good chance that either Hatteberg or Durazo
goes. They're both good, but we're logjammed at 1B* and many other teams
aren't. That means they're more valuable to someone else than they are to us. I
think Durazo is more likely to go because I think the bad September has left
Hatteberg slightly undervalued. Some others might move also - Byrnes, Bradford,
maybe even Zito. We've got some major-league-ready prospects that might move,
too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>* In addition to Hatteberg and
Durazo, we've got Dan Johnson in AAA. Jack Cust - a former Billy Beane
&quot;holy grail&quot; who slumped in Baltimore and has now been signed by
Oakland as a minor-league free agent - is another no-defense player like Durazo
who might be put at LF or 1B. Rookie Nick Swisher is tentatively planned for
RH, but he also plays 1B. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>As you may have seen by now, I was
wrong about Tim Hudson. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((Yeah, I noticed.... ;-) I did
see that, apparently Boston was the other push in here, since they also were
trying today to deal for Hudson (since Pedro is gone) but I don't think they
wanted to put Hanley Ramirez in the deal (Double AA level SS) and thus Atlanta
had the better offer.))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>We did indeed trade him to Atlanta,
in exchange for two young pitchers and a young outfielder, none of whom I had
heard of. Not sure if any of them go straight to the major leagues. Not much
news yet. What I see on the two pitchers shows only relief appearances in MLB,
but maybe they were starters in the minors. I would have thought Beane would be
looking for another starter, now that we've gotten rid of both Hudson and
Redman. We do have other options there, but they're not really solid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>What made this possible was when
Beane stopped asking for Giles, whom the Braves didn't want to give up. What
made that possible is an earlier, lower-profile trade in which we got
Milwaukee's 2B Keith Ginter for two prospects. This one is a classic
value-motivated trade. Ginter is a good hitter but was relatively low profile
due to being young and injured. His numbers aren't that much worse than someone
like Giles or Kent, but his price was much lower, so that's a relative bargain.
He's a good OBP type hitter, but weak defensively. I think the hope is that our
infield coach Ron Washington will be able to clean that up a bit. Wash is
famous for that: he's the guy who trained Tejada, Chavez, Crosby and Hatteberg,
none of whom were good fielders originally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><i>((I think for sure you have that
just about right. I would never have guessed that Hatteberg's career would have
gone as it did when he left Boston, for example.))</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Milwaukee has another hot 2B coming
up, so that made Ginter less valuable to them then he would be to someone else.
On our side was the same story. Lehr is a hard-throwing reliever who may work
out or may not. Three years ago, Luis Vizcaino looked very similar, and
Milwaukee did OK when they traded us for him, so maybe they're looking for
something similar. Possibly Beane thinks Milwaukee is overvaluing Lehr. Cruz is
a good outfield prospect, but we've got a couple of others in the system at the
same position on the same pace, so he's kind of redundant for us - ie, more
valuable elsewhere than he is here. </p>

<b>Mark D Lew (Thu, 16 Dec 2004 17:45:27 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Starting to read the reaction now.
Local fan base is overwhelmingly negative. To a certain extent that's to be
expected for any trade giving up a big name, but this seems to go beyond that.
Even the Moneyball-savvy seem to feel Beane should have gotten more. (They do
like the Ginter deal, though.) Many are citing Beane's recent &quot;if someone
makes an offer we can't refuse&quot; quote, suggesting that even if this deal
is OK it doesn't meet the unrefusability test. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Dan Meyer apparently is seen as a
legit starter, but he's a rookie like Blanton. Typically the A's like to bring
up the rookies in mid-season, but 05 now looks to be an exception for at least
one of them. Meyer is LH, same as Zito and Mulder, but Harden and Blanton are
both RH, so that's about right for the A's. Juan Cruz (RH) is generally seen as
a reliever or maybe 5th starter. My sense is that Beane is looking to fill up
bullpen with some more long relievers who can go two or three innings, or else
several of them who can pitch a full inning day after day like the Yankees
have. In 04 we had a weak bullpen of most short-termers or LH/RH specialists.
That forced the starters to go long - eg, all those complete games by Mulder -
which I think contributed to us sputtering late in the season. I wouldn't be
surprised is Bradford and/or Rincon is moved. Both are decent, but no longer
best-suited to our team, so if another team values them more, it's worth a
trade. Same for Dotel, come to think of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Charles Thomas is a
&quot;moneyball&quot; type hitter, lots of patience, not much power. The league
seems to have caught on to OBP generally, at least in terms of getting a lot of
walks. I'm starting to perceive that Beane has adjusted his focus slightly,
emphasizing walks less but looking for guys who are all-around good hitters but
lack HR-hitting power. Kendall is very much in this pattern, so is Ginter, and
so was Kotsay last year. Charles Thomas seems to be continuing the trend. The
idea would be that traditional good hitting is good, but everyone else is now
overvaluing the big bomb. We could end up a small ball team yet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Of course we did trim about $5
million from the payroll, so that counts for something. The Kendall deal put us
a little over the anticipated budget, so someone was going to have to move. I
thought it would be one or two of our mid-priced hitters, not a high-price
starting pitcher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Another story line goes back to
that &quot;ultimatum&quot; that Hudson's agent made. Everyone downplayed it,
but it is a little odd that Hudson said that if he is not re-signed for a
long-term contract by March he wouldn't even negotiate with the A's after the
season. It's hard to read between the lines, but many have speculated that
Hudson wanted to avoid the experience of a lame-duck final season like Tejada
had, so that if he wasn't going to get a deal like Chavez got, then he'd rather
move now. As a rule, the A's don't like to keep players who are unhappy here -
goes along with the more-valuable-elsewhere calculus - so if Hudson really
didn't want to stay, then that was a reason to move him. Of course Hudson
wouldn't say publicly that he wants to be traded, and neither would Beane, but
maybe they both understood that. It's interesting that Hudson ends up at
Atlanta, which was surely one of his top choices - again, making him more
valuable there than elsewhere (in that he's more signable for the future). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'><br>
<br>
<b>Mark D Lew (Sun, 19 Dec 2004 06:55:16 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>I sent that too soon. No time to
read all the commentary, but just contemplating. I see two possibilities: (1)
Beane really has been instructed to shed payroll. (2) It's the usual buy-low,
sell-high mentality. For whatever reason, Beane thinks those two contracts are
currently overvalued. Mulder had two more years at a moderate price (about $6m
a year), so that's not just a good player, but a good contract too. Could it be
that other teams value that contract even higher than what it's worth? The
astronomical salaries going to big-name starters lately suggests that perhaps
they do. Maybe Beane believes that there's no such thing as a superstar. The
reality is that, in spite of all their high-profile, Mulder and Hudson didn't
get us through the season, so maybe they really are overrated. If so, trade 'em
now while the price is still high. That could be the thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>The local fans must be shitting
their pants over this. They were all gloom and doom over Hudson being gone, but
this will surely seal it. Many are convinced that the team is headed for a
&quot;rebuilding&quot; period, ie, that we're selling off the team and
accepting that we'll suck in 05. I'm not yet convinced of that. I think Beane
likes being at least moderately competitive year after year. He's always done
well with young players. Maybe he thinks he sees something in these non-star
young big-leaguers he's collecting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Naturally some are asking, &quot;Is
Zito next?&quot;. Hard for me to believe that Zito is overvalued, though. He
was always the one people were saying was the weak link of the three. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>[later] Reviewing some of the
comments on Athletics Nation, they aren't nearly as negative as I expected.
People do think 05 is being abandoned, but they like the aggressive and early
rebuilding strategy. Also, the consensus seems to be that we got more value out
of Mulder than out of Hudson. (That may be partly because the fans have an
emotional attachment to Hudson which isn't there with Mulder.) I'm also seeing
some sabermetric type analysis of win shares due to starting pitching leading
to the conclusion that starting pitching is overpriced in today's market. That
would make starters today like closers were in the Moneyball era: insufficient
gain to warrant the high price tags associated with the stars. Better to get
almost-as-good SPs for much lower price and spend your money elsewhere where it
gets more win shares for the buck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Oops, now I see that Beane has
explicitly stated that he won't trade Zito. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Aha, here's another interesting
observation. Both Hudson and Mulder pitch significantly better in the Coliseum,
a pitcher's park. Maybe pitching in Oakland has inflated their perceived value,
so now Beane is collecting on it. The new pitchers could perhaps be similarly
helped by the park. (Zito, curiously, doesn't show nearly the home-away split.
And Redman, come to think of it, had that reversed.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Here's another thought. Both
pitchers went to the NL. Hudson loves to hit (and used to be very good at it).
Mulder loves to hit. Zito, on the other hand, is a horrible hitter, the
absolute caricature of a pitcher who is an automatic out. Not that the A's
care, but it makes the other two that much more valuable for the teams trading
for them. I really have to go to bed now. </p>

<b>Mark D Lew Mon, 20 Dec 2004 15:19:51 -0800)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Here's a very interesting post by a
Cardinals fan, suggesting that the Mulder trade was not just bad for the Cards,
but colossally bad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>http://mb3.scout.com/fstlouiscardinalsfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=5241.topic&amp;start=50&amp;stop=50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Among other things, he calls Daric
Barton the best prospect in all of baseball, destined to be MVP some day. I had
no idea, though I did wonder why Billy Beane was getting a minor-league
catcher, since we've got four good catchers in our farm system right now (and
we just traded for a top veteran). But Beane will always grab a bargain player
even if he doesn't have an immediate use for it. Presumably some of our catcher
prospects will get traded. The conventional wisdom on Kendall is that in
addition to being a good Moneyball-type hitter right now, he's also wanted to
break in the new young starters we're now planning to play. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>The A's fan base, including the
knowledgeable section, is near unanimous that the Mulder deal was good for us
(opinion of the Hudson trade is much more negative), which makes me inclined to
believe that the Cardinal fan here is right that Jocketty got taken. One
wonders whether all the negotiation with the Cardinals about Hudson was part of
a bait-and-switch plan - maybe Beane could sense that Jocketty would take
either starter, so he dangled Hudson out there to negotiate a package that he
wanted, then declined to pull the trigger and traded Hudson to Atlanta instead,
then came back to St Louis saying, &quot;Hey, if you're still interested in a
pitcher, I'll do that same deal but for Mulder instead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>They say Barton is really young, so
I wonder if that means he'll be playing in Vancouver (single A short season).
If so, I might try to see him. My new girlfriend lives a few blocks from where
the Everett Aqua Sox play. (The Aqua Sox are the Seattle's farm team in the
same league as Vancouver.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>Aha, now I read in Baseball America
that although Barton was drafted as a catcher, he's not very good defensively
anywhere and thus is likely to be moved to LF or 1B and maybe end up as a DH.
They also say that he'll likely play in Stockton. </p>

<i>Game Notes:</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>1) The FREGT draw is rejected and
then reproposed. I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back
to where we were on the voting, which was this: (1) Some of you have
&quot;perpetual draw votes on this proposal on file&quot;, those are still in
force; (2) Some of you do not and have been voting every season, for you if you
FAIL to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal. If we get to a
situation where no centers change hands for three game years, then we can go to
the next step, which will require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual
draw votes. And failure to vote would be a yes. The upcoming Fall 1917 will be
two game years by that measure. Even if Turkey is missing TWO of its home
centers in Winter 1917, I think we are still going to advance to the next level
of voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be allowed with
failure to vote equalling a yes. If any other significant movement or centers
change hands then that will be another story, of course. This does NOT mean the
game will just be ended by the GM, it just means someone must veto the draw
every turn. </p>

<i>Game Notes:</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i>
website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section. Ask if you have any questions. Press is
VERY welcome!!! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>2) Up above in parentheses is the
card you played to get to where you are in the field. The replenishment card is
the last card in your list. Be careful to note that the card you played (the
one in parentheses) is not available for you, for next turn. Just for fun, I'm
going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a rough measure
of how the teams are doing. Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint
and final lines in the right places that really counts. We can calculate an
&quot;efficiency score&quot; later, which will be the ratio of scoring points
per replenishment. If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a
10% score will be really tremendous for this measure (note that Rick still is
way ahead of this pace). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>3) A lot of unhappy people this
time, as some of the pack didn't quite reform. And our last three stragglers
are now all but dropped from the pack. I'm not actually dropping anyone, since
I want to keep them accumulating their (small) replenishments for the total.
And for all except Carl Sagan, the 25 dollar quartet had a REALLY, REALLY
amazing turn. They now are in second place in the replenishment standings, but
the question is: can they turn those cards into points?!?! Next turn looks to
be VERY interesting now. Six more riders remain to score points crossing the
Sprint line, but lots of BIG points waiting at the Finish line. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.0pt'>(BOOB to BART): What's with this
sticking with your parents this turn? Silent and obedient, eh? Well, by playing
your 9 rather than your 11, you broke up the pack, to your family's detriment.
Then again, maybe that was your plan? And Zedd may not be QUITE dead yet..... </p>
