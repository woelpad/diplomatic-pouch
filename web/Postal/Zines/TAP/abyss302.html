<br /><br />I would like to get another game of Diplomacy, either the Modern variant or regular Dip,
started very soon.
Each game needs just THREE more people.
Oops, one person dropped out of the Modern, so we need FOUR for that one. 
Please think about signing up, thanks!
And I need only ONE more player to start Breaking Away.
I should be able to start that next issue if someone steps forward.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On that list, I notified everyone of this issue's delay.
I won't repeat all that here, but a confluence of events, part of which is starting
to be a recurring Spring nightmare, unavoidably delayed the publication of this issue.
I intend to get back on track now, and I should be able to do that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JEFF KEY</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been planning to put Jeff Key up here many times in the past, but
someone else always made it to the list.
Since we have the aborted John Beshara search, this is the time to find Jeff.
I met Jeff that I remember just once, I think it was at Paul Gardner's house
and one of those wild spread out cons that he used to have at his house in
Vermont.  But I've not heard from Jeff now in many, many years.
So let's go find him!
As always it is worth fifty bucks if you locate him and get him to write to me.
Jeff, of course, is most famous for devising and naming the Key Lepanto 
game opening alliance between Austria and Italy against Turkey.
For some reason, I've been seeing LOTS of Key Lepantos or aborted 
Key Lepantos lately.  It's about time that we find Jeff and see what he's
been up to.
<i>((If anyone knows where Paul Gardner is, that would be good too....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And remember I got called in as a STANDBY for Turkey in game WM04R221!!!
This game did end with center counts Andy Bartalone with 15, Glenn Ledder with 12, 
me with 6, and Dan in Austria with just Greece.
In another world I could have challenged Glenn and Andy more, I wish them 
both luck as they move on to the semis.  
In particular, I don't know how Andy will fare if he continues to be as busy
in his new job as he was during this game.
He just didn't pay enough attention.  
In another world, his clock would have been cleaned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
But most of the talk that there has been has about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson
and Tony Dickinson, among others!).  
This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really
is quite comprehensive.

Our efforts to reestablish a Diplomacy hobby in Chicago are going well. 
The Windy City Weasels have met four times now, with the March 12 session
featuring two boards. We've got a game scheduled for April 29, already
filled, and I'll probably host a game in May. We're hoping to put a
three-board session together sometime this summer. Have a host, but no date
as of yet. Stay tuned. Our goal is to host a tournament by next year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks for still sending me all those <i>TAP</i>s through the ether.  I look
forward to each one, even though I haven't yet got up the nerve sign up
for a game.  If you have a moment, I have a question.  It is about
convoys, and even though I don't think that you are a rules lawyer,
hopefully you won't consider it too boring. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No question is too boring really, especially if you want to keep the
map, the rules, and adjudication in your head, even simple queries keep
the mind active and accessing those neurons.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was looking over the board of a game that I am playing, and I asked
myself a question.  Why don't we just convoy that army through Denmark?
I couldn't ever remember seeing anyone do this before, so I looked into
the rules to see if it was allowed.  The old rules (pre-2000 4th
edition) say that "Fleets in Kiel and Constantinople, and in any other
coastal province, may not convoy."   The 4th edition rules specifically
rule out a convoy through Denmark.  I guess that settles the rules
issue, but my question goes to the history of this.  Was Denmark always
considered the same as any other coastal province?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((To my knowledge, yes, but you can look at some of the copies of the old
rules.  See:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/diplomacy_rules.htm  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Some of the early rules are less clear on this point.  You can read them for
yourself and see how you would interpret them.  Denmark had a "special
rule" in the early years, but it was about movement through it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Considering real world geography, I would have thought that it might be
useful to allow a convoy exception for Denmark, and consider it a
special province.  An actual fleet in Denmark need not be in port, but
would more likely be patrolling Kattegat, The Sound and The Belts.  I
would think that allowing the convoy would open up movement across the
peninsula, enhancing the dynamism of the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Possibly it would, but who would it hurt?  Probably it would hurt Russia,
who would be less protected from convoys to Livonia.  Other thoughts from
the peanut gallery??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How was it decided that Denmark couldn't convoy?  Were there any house
rules that said it could or couldn't?  What sort of problems would be
introduced if it could?  Apparently there was enough confusion to prompt
a clarification in the last edition of the rules.  I couldn't find
anything on this at The Pouch or the Diplomacy Archive.  Any thoughts?
Of course, if this rule were changed, somebody would be sure to request
a change to allow troop movements between North Africa and Spain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((The discussions on this were held way back in the 1960's mostly, even
before my time, but others here would have more to say as they were there.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If this is worthy of inclusion in TAP, please feel free.  
<i>((For just that reason, I'm going to do just that.))</i>

Howdy, Jim,
First of all, thanks for the helpful reply.  I really do appreciate
it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Tuesday, March 14, 2006, you wrote:
szine came out of the pronunciation wars.  szine is pronounced
sssssZeen with an accent on the "Z" sound (sometimes zeen was used
as an alternative to this).  But the evil bad pronouncers,
pronounced zine as z-I-ne more like sign (sometimes xyn was used as
an alternative to this).))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ah, yes.  I remember a phone convo with Bruce Linsey back in the Great
Feud days (which the hobby has sensibly left far behind, and I'm happy
to do likewise) where I was asking what Kathy Byrne sounded like.  He
did a harsh New York accent using this `zein' pronunciation.  I
remember how it grated a quarter century later.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Well, yes, that is the idea.  Kathy Byrne Caruso was a good friend,
even as I disagreed with her pronunciation.  You are aware that she
passed away from cancer a few years ago, unfortunately being one
of the very last people to let the Great Feud go??  Pretty much all
of the remaining living parties are presently subbers to my szine.
Well, technically, I send it to a lot of them for free, and happily so.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I remember reading that and thinking of my emotional, impulsive,
judgmental youth, where all three of the above adjectives didn't
really need much supporting data to kick in.  The Great Feud did the
hobby immense harm, and I played my vitriolic part in it.  I can't
unplay it, but I sure can wish John whatever peace and comfort a man
can have in such a case, and I can wish Kathy was still with us.  She
could say `zein' all day long and I wouldn't mind.

I think he's doing better now, and I'm VERY glad to hear that.
On the "what to do with the old szines" there really isn't a lot.

really have most or all of what you have already and they hate
sorting.  If you wanted to scan them and put them up on the web,
this would be a great service to the hobby, there have been some
abortive efforts to do this over the years, not done well.
Edi Birsan is leading a new effort to do that, and you could assist him.
In a fundamental way, once the szine is scanned in, it is "saved".
Even if I still prefer hard copy szines as active on-going concerns.
And if you tried to sell them on E-Bay, say, no one would buy them, I
would guess.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Probably not, and certainly not unless I really inventoried them,
which I am only moderately willing to do.  I definitely have neither
the time nor the urgency to scan them, though I agree that would be a
valuable usage.  I guess I just sort of assumed that there was some
hobby archivist/packrat collecting such things at any given time.  But
I've been reading <i>TAP</i> for years now, and you seem to know the hobby as
well as anyone.  If you say there aren't many options, I tend to think
you know what you're talking about.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((As I said, let's print this exchange and you can see what people say.
In particular, I want to know what Edi Birsan has to say about this.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With that in mind:  can you recommend a way to deal with them that
doesn't involve a recycling bin? Some of them really do go back a long
ways; I got some people to unload their old collections way back when
by paying postage.  The only Dip folks I'm really in touch with are
Brux and to a lesser degree Joan Extrom, whom I've met in person.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No problem, Jonathan, some people might like to have what you're
trying to unload, can you give me a postal address so I have some
idea of where you are physically?  If you're talking "banana boxes"
it should be picked up.  And since your collection doesn't overlap
mine much, as long as my wife isn't listening in, I might be
willing to take them.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Address is the problem:  I live far from everyone, and freight costs
on two banana-boxfuls of paper are going to be high. 
If people remember specific zine
names, I can pretty well give them an idea if any are in there.  I was
hoping they would be worth a little bit to someone, but my rational
side is snarking pretty good at the notion that anyone would spend
real money on top of the freight.

Tournament or what?  Nothing annoys Rick Desper and Warren Goesle than seeing
one of my whacked out predictions coming true.
It really was obvious to me as I looked at the teams that Florida was ready
to make a big run, and they did.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On Barry Bonds, you all may recall I have been defending him consistently on some level.
It is understandable to me, yet also incomprehensible as well that Barry
has become the face of the steroids scandal.  It would seem that it really
should be Rafael Palmeiro, who lied before Congress AND was caught by the
actual rules of Baseball.
But of course he's not trying to play any more.
You can say that it is all Bud Selig's fault, but even that (sorry, Goz) is
too simplistic.
Baseball had turned a blind eye on purpose toward performance enhancement
(remember back in the 1980's when we heard that steroids didn't matter because
they couldn't help you hit a baseball???) and the results have come home to roost.
But Barry Bonds is a complex guy, who is desperately trying to pick up and
correct his perception of the wrongs done to his father Bobby Bonds and his
godfather Willie Mays.
You can argue those points of the 1970's if you want, and Barry's view of them.
But the evidence is strong and this is the REAL reason why people can say that
racism and Barry Bonds are related.  It's not racism today, but racism from the
1970's that is showing up today, in my view.
I have to say that I'm happy that (as of this writing) he has finally passed Babe Ruth.
I hope he goes over to the American League next year (as Hank Aaron did at the
end of his career) and ultimately passes Aaron.
I am not blind to anything about how it happened, but I still am rooting for it,
and for Barry to find some peace.
I doubt he ever will find that peace, but I hope he does.
The latest issues with Human Growth Hormone, I think, will be even greater.
There is a research team (still a bit underfunded even with Bud Selig's "generous"
donation) at UCLA developing a Human Growth Hormone test.
It will be a big deal when the test is developed for baseball, but will be an
even bigger issue for football where the lack of testing probably means that the
lineman who is NOT taking it is the rare exception.
But this is all speculation.
My firm belief is that you set the rules of the game, including the testing procedure,
and then you live with it.
At that point, it is the games that count, not the rules mongering.
The data suggests that this is the way most people feel.
Major league baseball interest and attendance remain strong.
This just keeps newspapers, talking heads on ESPN, and talk shows humming.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the start of the baseball season, I sent the following predictions to Rick,
Goz, and Dave:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Baseball season starts.  My picks for the "surprises" in each 
division are Oakland, Detroit, and Boston in the AL, Detroit 
being the only one of those not to improve enough to be in the
playoffs (I may be insane but Oakland and Boston are both playing
Moneyball to the max wonderfully I think).  In the NL, heart with
the Giants, head with the Dodgers; Cincinnati AND Milwaukee since
it is such a big division, and Atlanta.... since yes, they are
just going to win the Division again.....  Cincinnati and Milwaukee
probably won't do enough to actually make the playoffs, but both
will challenge the Cubs and Cardinals.  Houston is going to drop
like a rock..... them's my thoughts.  More in next TAP, write
something, eh?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let me add to that a couple of points.  Right now, it is looking like the Wild
Card in the AL may come out of the Central Division.  If it does, then the Yankees
and the Red Sox are fighting it out for only one slot, with only an outside chance
at the wild card for the other.
This could finally be the year that I can tell Goz..... no, the Yankees don't
even make the playoffs - but my ongoing prediction is just that the Yankees
aren't winning another WORLD SERIES any time soon.
For those who have been waiting for Jim Leyland to return to managing, you can
write it down, he is one of the top two or three managers of this era.
Detroit is for real, as long as Leyland is pulling the strings.
The improvement of the Blue Jays will mostly act to pull both the Yankees and 
Red Sox down enough that I really don't think both can make it to the playoffs
at this point.
The entirely predictable Yankees injury problems (given the age and history of the
players on their team) really has them on the bubble.
Yes, they may try to buy their way back in, but can they buy their way back in?
I wouldn't bet on it.
Also, I think Roger Clemens will choose the Astros again, but it will be interesting.
He really should go play for the Rangers.
<i>((I wrote this BEFORE Roger actually went ahead and chose the Astros again,
who STILL will drop like a rock.
And THEN, you'll have a bidding war to trade for Clemens once Houston is out of it.
In that war, I think the Red Sox will win it..... don't be surprised if Roger ends
up with the Red Sox in August.))</i>
The Rangers CAN win the AL West, and would be the favorites IF Roger signed with them.
Colorado's good young pitchers have really surprised (lots of people wondered if it
was practically possible to develop a young pitcher with Coors Field as a home park)
and they could win the NL West.
I especially like Aaron Cook.
The Reds are about to get back Eric Milton and need him to pitch well as a starter to
stay in the race for the NL Central, and perhaps even win it.
It would be good to see Ken Griffey, Jr. back in games that matter.
He's quietly rebuilding his Hall of Fame career and I'm rooting for him to be
successful at that too.
And never bet against the Braves coming back to win the NL East, never.... not as long
as Schuerholz and Cox are running the team in the front office and on the field respectively.
This really isn't a "money issue", it's a talent evaluation issue.
Schuerholz has a book just out that should be interesting reading.
I've not read it, but Schuerholz' views and mine are generally compatible.
He really doesn't like the part of Moneyball that dictates SABRmetrics are everything.
He believes in the balance between statistics, personality, and scouting for intangibles.
That's the right answer, I think.
And, yes, Jeff Francoeur really will be a star someday, he's just young.
With all those strikeouts, he's a Moneyball nightmare, but Schuerholz has it right.
Now.... all the backs and forths between David, Goz, Rick, and me over the last few
months, both Baseball and NCAA basketball..... I hope you enjoy it, feel free to chime in.

his email address.  (Well, that's technically not true...uh, never
mind...)
I'm picking UConn to win (big surprise, eh?)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Red Sox are getting beaten pretty badly in most of their Spring
Training games, not that that is so important...esp. with Ortiz,
Varitek (and others?) away at the World Baseball do-hidgey

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other day, ARod won a game with a bases-loaded, 2-outs hit in the
9th.  Talk about a guy who's hard to root for!  Bill Simmons thinks
his interactions with Varitek must be interesting.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I sent it around to the TAP E-Mail list, but I guess you aren't

though I don't think they will.))

((I'm in Jamie's and would kinda prefer to fill out only one

((And I hate A-Rod more and more every year..... an update from NOW,
A-Rod is mired in a horrible slump.
He actually is becoming so pathetic that I'm feeling sorry for him.
He does carry the weight of the world, and the Yankees, on his shoulders.
But I'm even ever more sure that the Yankees will never win the World
Series with A-Rod.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, you could put identical picks up in PTKS, if you wish.  So far
the group includes Lori Fleming, Jeff Dwornicki, Brian Lee, Tim
Richardson, Jeff Ladd, and myself.  Tim usually does a great job with
his picks.

At about 1:30 a.m. here, I checked the score of the UConn game.  It
kept me up an extra hour, following the game online.   :(

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To be the first #1 seed to lose to a #16 would have been particularly
ignominious.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oops - Kansas loss.  I hated that regional because none of the top
seeds looked worthy.  Kansas was my primary pick, but I see my
Electric Boogaloo picks have Memphis.  Time to start rooting for
Calipari.  (Ugh.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Did you put the whammy on Kansas with your comment below?  I think
it's your fault.  :)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why did you wander out of the PTKS group after wandering in? 
Curious.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My brackets really need Georgetown to beat Ohio State.  I think they
can do it, esp. based on the way OSU nearly lost to Davidson. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think I'm confused by ESPN...... ;-)
On the good side, I can't seem to figure out how to enter a second pick, so
I just have one pick.
The UConn-Albany game was compelling.  You probably missed Calhoun's interviews after
the game.  He was REALLY struggling.  He said it was the hardest
game he had EVER coached and he pulled out EVERY coaching stop
that he could think of.  He said he knew eventually he could get
the team to dominate inside, and he did, but it was tough.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(("To be the first #1 seed to lose to a #16 would have been particularly
ignominious."  
Indeed, I still hope it happens some time!  It would justify the
existence of 16 seeds.
As for rooting for Calipari, oh yeah, but I can't do that, 
I'm going to pick up on an underdog
in that region and root for it, and in the meantime, Howland's UCLA
team impresses me.  I hate Calipari....))

I listened to the second half of the UConn/George Mason game.  It
seemed like UConn was blundering repeatedly and that George Mason
simply could not miss a shot.  Shooting 3-pointers all the time isn't
supposed to be a great strategy, but if your shooting is hot, then
any team can beat any other team.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I hadn't seen much or heard much about Florida (or LSU for that
matter) before the tournament.  I wouldn't underestimate George
Mason, but yeah, Florida looks to be in a good position.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But we cannot have Florida beat UCLA in the final.  Then you would
win the pool!  That would be like the Red Sox winning the World

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since it's late and I'm tired, here's the fearless Goz predictions 2K6:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> Picking all the places?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays, Orioles, Devil Rays.  Maybe the 
D-Rays take 4th over a shambles of a Baltimore team, as the Orioles 
might not win 60 games this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> Ditto.  
Yankees have so much hitting that they'll beat up on most
major league pitching.  But as for the playoffs...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  Indians, White Sox (WC), Twins, Tigers, Royals.  I had to 
get this pick in early, as the White Sox keep dropping in my eyes 
(though I think they'll be better in Aug/Sep than in Apr/May).  They 
can't have all the pitching and all the luck they had last year, and 
will really have to fight off Boston, Toronto, Texas and Oakland for the 
Wild Card.  The Indians again look like they could be really streaky 
this year, which of course could cut both ways, but I'll pick them to 
hold it together this time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> Hmm...yes, 
I kept wondering last year when the bottom would fall out
on the White Sox pitching.  But I'll stick with them, in spite of the
early weakness by Buehrle and Garcia.  
White Sox, Indians, Tigers, Twins, various college teams, Royals ))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Apparently Rick has decided to rant for me this year...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  Angles, Rangers, A's, Mariners.  This division got really 
good.  All 4 over .500?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> 
As, Angels, Mariners, Rangers until further notice.  Could happen in
any order, except Texas winning.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Braves (yawn!), Mets (WC), Phillies, Nationals, Marlins.  The 
bottom fell out of this division, as the Marlins had another sell-off 
and the Nationals imploded.  Look for Philly to contend for the WC.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> Braves win.  
Who knows about the other teams, other than Nats and
Marlins not being terribly strong.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Cardinals, Astros, Cubs, Brewers, Pirates, Reds.  You know 
you're bad when I pick you behind Pittsburgh.  This year it's not close, 
as St. Louis is the only team worth discussing in this division.  The 
Cubs won't make .500, and the Astros won't make it by much.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> Cardinals look very good.))</i>  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think they win this by default more than anything else.  This whole 
division went down in a big way.  I think they get 90 wins and win by 7 
games, but they play 95 within the division.  They may be the weakest entry 
in the playoffs in either league this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Dodgers, Diamondbacks, Padres, Giants.  This one is a big 
guess, as all 4 could probably win the division, but I'm playing 
percentages here (someone explain that concept to Jim-Bob).  
Collectively they'll be better than last year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> Hey, 
Jim-Bob picked Florida to win the hoops tournament.  Now's not
an especially good time to be picking on him.
Dodgers by default.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, you HAVE to pick on Jim-Bob just after he's had a win, otherwise he 
won't think we still love him.
Second, you HAVE to pick on Jim-Bob just after he's had a win, because 
otherwise his head swells up and explodes.
Third, Jim-Bob does not get wins by playing percentages.  I'm pretty sure 
that he'd lose big at poker tables and lottery drawings.  But now and then a 
50-1 shot wins in the NCAAs, MLB or the Kentucky Derby.  Jim-Bob usually is 
picking in those ranges.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Hey, I resemble those comments!!!
And maybe I avoid playing poker and lotteries for just that reason!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Angels over Yankees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Braves over Mets.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> 
It's hard to pick playoffs this early because it may come down to
injuries.  I'll pick the Red Sox to win the AL and the Cardinals to
win the NL.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Braves over Angels.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

they seem to have the most balance.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

So at what point are we disgusted with the steroid situation?  I have a 
son who shows some athletic talent (granted, he's only 3), which isn't 
real surprising since Carol had an Olympic qualifying time in the 100 
hurdles in high school.  I don't want him looking at juiced players and 
emulating them to get an "edge".  How do we clean this out?  What do we 
do about the players whose heads have gotten so big that their helmets 
are used as jacuzzis?  What do we as fans really want here?  The home 
run is a sensation and a highlight, and we eat it up.  A steroid-fueled 
1998 home run race between McGwire and Sosa may have saved the game.  
But is it art and is it sport?  If it's just entertainment then it goes 
in the same column as WWF, and should be treated the same.  I'd like to 
think of it as something more.  Comments?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Rick Desper comments:</b> 
The Bonds HR record pursuit should be quite interesting.  I figure
he'll pass Ruth but not Aaron.  And there will be plenty of boos
along the way.
The thing is, the owners were utterly complicit in the steroid
nonsense.  They were quite happy to let obviously steroid-enriched
players hit lots of HRs, because that increased their revenue.  All
the HR records of McGwire, Sosa, Bonds, and Palmeiro will be forever
viewed as dubious.  The guy who comes through this looking good is
Griffey, who clearly stayed off the juice, and just passed Mantle. 
While he's had too many injuries to threaten Ruth or Aaron, he'll be

Well, I think part of it is not really being all that impressed by
anybody, and part of it is not wanting to pick the Yankees.  If the
Yankees should be overwhelming favorites, I would pick them.  But
their pitching is still a bit thin, and Mariano is getting long in
the tooth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I really, honestly, think there is precisely ZERO chance
of the Yankees getting to the World Series.
Admittedly, that is two months after Rick's comment where the
injuries are mounting.
Still, I think it clearly can be seen that Joe Torre is one of
the game's best managers.
He's pulling off an amazing managing job.
But that can only get them INTO the playoffs.
I'll never mention getting Florida right in the NCAA's if I'm wrong
and the Yankees still stand in October..... is that enough, Goz?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't like the Angels that much because their pitching is old or
gone.  I'm really not sold on the Indians.  The Mariners could put it
all together (for once), esp. having picked up Washburn to add to an
already decent staff. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Rick has been proven generally prescient about all this in
particular, as well as what follows.  That doesn't prove he'll be
right in the end, but he very well could be.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lacking a compelling reason to not pick the Red Sox, I'll pick them. 
Besides, Schilling is going to be better this season than last, and
Beckett is a good pick-up.  Some acquisitions are pretty good (Crisp,
Gonzalez, and Loretta) and Papelbon should take over the closer job.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It sounds like Foulke is done, which is too bad, but he's already
locked up his place in Red Sox lore, so I hope the fans aren't too
harsh to him.  Also, the Red Sox have 2 of the 3 best hitters in the
AL (Manny and Ortiz along with ARod).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Cardinals still have Mulder, Carpenter, Pujols, and a pretty
solid team.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's very hard for me to keep up with American sports from London,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Big Unit was shelled yesterday.  Ouch!  I think the Yankees
really cannot afford to have him be having difficulties.  Their
rotation, if he's not reliable, is crap.  Mussina will probably be
reasonably OK, but they cannot rely on Chacon, Wang, and Wright to
carry the load.  That rotation just isn't competitive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've noticed that the Bosox are 10-4.  Nice that they're at least
bothering to have a traditional hot start this season.  Beckett and
Schilling both look very good, and Papelbon is comfortable as the
closer.  It would be lovely if Foulke could merit the closer role
again, so Papelbon could be put into the rotation.  The hitting seems
fine.  Nixon looks like he's back for real.  Youkilis looks like he's
justifying being used as an everyday starter.  I guess the verdict is
still out on Lowell, Loretta, and Gonzalez.  I think Loretta will be
fine, and Gonzalez will be OK, esp. on defense.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Mets are cruising.  Pedro got his 200th victory and, though I was
concerned about his durability during his last season in Boston, I
think he'll pitch at least three more seasons.  Possibly more, esp.
if 300 gets in range.  (Not that I think he'd need 300 wins to be a
Hall of Famer - he might well be one already, and 250 would certainly
be enough.)  I'm kind of used to seeing the Mets pick up players in
the offseason every year, and having them fail every year.  But this
might be the season they beat the Braves.  I think the Mets have the
deeper roster, but it's so hard to pick the year the Braves will
finally collapse. 
<i>((Quick Pedro note, I think it still was worth it for the Red Sox
to let him go, all that being said.
And he is a HoFer now, most particularly because of that winning percentage,
what is it almost .700, he still hasn't LOST 100 games yet!!!))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So yes, it's April, and I'm wondering if this will be the year the
Braves and Yankees finally lose their divisions.

<i>((Rick makes some good points, and yes, the Yankees are STILL in trouble,
even in April.  The deal on Foulke and Papelbon is this..... the Red
Sox don't want to take a young budding superstar like Papelbon and
jerk him back and forth between the rotation and closing.  If and 
when they shift him, and it might not be until next year, they want
to be sure they aren't moving him back.  Foulke's been told that he
might get the closer job back, but even if he pitches well he might
not.  He'll be closing tonight as Papelbon had a lot of pitches last
night.  So that will be an interesting test.  Some of the Red Sox,
still influenced by Bill James, have been talking again about the
bullpen (not closer) by committee idea where you match people up
to the job in the late innings, but everyone is part of the equation.
I think we'll see Papelbon in the 7th inning sometime for the
big strikeout.  They SHOULD Have done that last night, flipflopping
Timlin and Papelbon.))</i>

For the myopic of you who can't see beyond the Red Sox/Yankees, please
note the following truths as of 19 April:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1.  No one in the AL West is over .500.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 2.  If the playoffs started today the Cubs would be in and the Cards
would be out.

 3.  The calendar says, "April".

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Yankees win the AL East.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Braves win the NL East.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Cubs are disappointments again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wake me the next time I'm wrong on any of those.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's actually better being a Cubs' fan this year, as by this time last
year they were eliminated from the playoffs.  It looks like we can hang
on to hope until at least the All-Star break, but I'm betting it doesn't
go much beyond then.  Still, it's good to see Greg Maddux as a 30-year
old again, since we missed him here the last time he was pitching this
well.  At some point he will be recognized as one of the top-10 pitchers
of all time.  Since his fastball isn't any faster than mine is, that's
quite an accomplishment.

So I check the Wednesday Tribune Sports' section and find that someone 
new has switched sports.  Actually, they switched a long time ago, I 
just didn't notice and you guys might not have either.  Mike Greenwell, 
last seen prowling the outfield at Fenway in 1996 or so, left the game 
at age 32 and headed to...stock car racing.  After winning 37 races at 
local tracks in the late model divisions, which might not even be 
equivalent to baseball's Class A ball, he gets to make his debut this 
weekend in the Craftsman Truck Series, which is NASCAR's Class Double-A 
minor league, at Mansfield, Ohio (he apparently has a 3 race contract, 
but I don't know what other Truck races he'll run).  I won't make the 
race, and I don't get Speed Channel so I can't watch it either, but I 
thought you might want to know.  Or not.

The bad news is that qualifying for the Truck race in Mansfield, OH was 
rained out.  The good news is that, due to the screwy way that the rules 
read for such cases, Mike Greenwell gets to start from the position that 
his car is in in owner points for the race tomorrow, which is 20th out 
of 36.  2PM EDT on Speed, for those of you playing at home.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've never seen Mansfield Speedway on TV, but at 1/2 mile and a lot of 
banking, and several drivers not particularly polished in the field 
(besides Greenwell), it's likely to have 100 laps out of 250 under 
caution.

Mike Greenwell didn't get voted off the NASCAR Truck circuit, and didn't 
really do all that badly in his first start at this level.  Started 20th, 
finished 26th, last car on the lead lap.  All this despite a pit road 
penalty and a no-contact spin during the race.  I believe that he's under 
contract for 2 more starts at this level this year.

It's not akin to picking the Yankees because the Yankees are evil

inhabitants just happen to be great at soccer.  Picking Duke to win
in the NCAAs is just silly.  They've never been as dominant as the
Yankees and are known more for being overrated than for actually
winning the tournament.  Duke's really only won the tournament three
times, which is only once more than UConn.  Or Louisville.  Brazil is

... Paul Gardner, you ask?  (First thing I've noticed in today's issue 301.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've seen Paul about once a year lately; he makes it to some of Bruce's 
housecons.  I don't have his e-mail address right now, but Bruce does.  
Paul is working for himself as a housepainter  and plasterer; Google for 
"Hawk &amp; Brush" and you'll find a Brattleboro address and a phone number.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still enjoy thinking of the two cons I attended at his family's 
Newfane home, and playtesting your Spy Dip variant among other adventures.

Dear Jim: Just wanted to say congratulations on the production of your 300th issue of
<i>TAP</i>.  You are now in 6th place on the All-Time list of North American zine
publications, per Meinel's <i>Encyclopedia of Dip Zines</i> if the figures on Page 62 are 
correct.
<i>((It's on page 67 or 49 in my edition, depending on whether you use the internal page
count or the PDF page count, but in any case, to my knowledge you count correctly.
Boast ended very soon after this at the count of near 335.
Dippy went along further, into third place I believe, but ended short of 400 (I have
that in my records someplace).
No one will ever catch Boardman, but I expect to get into second place before I'm done
with this (Runestone is in second place at 375).  
I see 400 as very doable, in six to eight years.))</i>
BTW, you knocked <i>Bushwacker</i> out of 6th place on that list.
I produced only 234 regular issues, ending in August 1991.
<i>((Andy Lischett, with Cheesecake, also has since passed you.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am assuming that you will publish the other "leftover" material in yout next issue.
This would include the material which I sent to you, which was originally going to go into
Issue #300. 
Please advise me if I'm wrong.
<i>((You're not wrong, let me stick it this issue with the subszines, just below....
after a few more letters.
I was going to retype/scribe it in, but I think in the interests of time, and given how
well you've paged it, I'm just going to reprint from your typing.
If people clamor for your Heroes/Villains list or other items, we can print those too.
A few comments on the AFI/Fred Davis discrepancies.
I agree with you and others about Lawrence of Arabia, it doesn't play that well now
if you actually watch it, on the other hand, The Wizard of Oz never loses its magic
and I'm not sure why you downrated that one so far - still high to be sure.
On the ones that AFI missed that you added, I agree completely about Rebecca
and Miracle on 34th Street; I'm less sure about Mrs. Miniver, Mr. Chips, and 
Mr. Roberts - something of a theme there, somehow.  And I just don't think
On Golden Pond is THAT good as a movie.
Inherit the Wind is a good pickup on your part, that stands out to me on Page 2.
Finally, for top 10, I'd put back in Dr. Strangelove (not in anyone's top 10 here,
but definitely in mine) and Wizard of Oz for sure.
Since I'd take Schindler's List, Godfather Part I, and Some Like it Hot OUT of the
my top 10, the rest of your top 10 and generally the order being my picks as well,
I'd still have to put in another movie.
If I were to pick out of nowhere, Start the Revolution Without Me is my favorite
screwball historical comedy of all time.
Plus, some friends of mine and I are convinced that the first reel of Woody Allen's
Take the Money and Run is the most perfectly directed sequence of film ever produced.
I stand on that particular opinion.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We still don't have an Internet address. <i>((It seems that changed recently, but
I can't put my fingers on the update just this second.))</i>
Our old computer died, and it will be another few weeks before we can buy a new one.
So, you can reach us only by phone and regular mail.
We just got a new long-distance phone service which is even cheaper than the one we
had before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thank you for including the color photos of several of we diplomats from the 1970s
and 1980s.
How we have changed since these "baby pictures" were taken!
The obituary by Larry Peery on John Beshara was also very well done. 
While I did not like Beshara, he did play an important part in the early days of
the Postal hobby.
A lot of we Old-Timers are nearing the end of the line.
I only hope that similar obituaries can be written for the rest of us when we 
shuffle off this mortal coil.
<i>((If I were you, I would be lobbying Conrad von Metzke to write yours, 
not to say we want to be like the New York Times and have them written in
advance, but Conrad would do the best job, I think.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My only criticism of Issue #300 is that I thought too much space was devoted to music.
I know you are very much into the music scene, but not all of your readers are into that
subject.
<i>((One of the things you can do in a landmark issue, is, well, put politely turn
your readers round and round and do what you want.
I have no regrets except for this delay and how behind I am right now.))</i>
I skipped several pages of your music reviews, as I know nothing about most of the
bands/songs reported on there.
My musical interests are still mostly stored in the 1950s and 60s, when I was in the Army,
when I was courting and a newlywed, and when I spent 5 weeks in a VA Hospital in 1955
with eye trouble, and had access to several popular radio stations.
Inge and I were married in 1957, so, of course, music from that era is still very much
in my memory.
It was all nice, gentle, romantic music then.
<i>((Yes, that's just my parents' generation, they were married one year before you,
and I was born in 1957.
I can see why "Love Will Tear Us Apart" doesn't resonate with you.
Every generation feels that way to some degree.
The number of newer songs that I really like is much diminished over songs from the same
life changes period for me.
That's pretty much true for most people, I think.
No biggie, but it's my szine, and the way the model works is that I print what I like.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just hope my eye condition and Parkinson's doesn't grow any worse, and keep me from
being semi-active in the Dip hobby.
I'll let you know more about my medical problems later.

Hi Jim!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, please let me know your current address.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, my address is:
82 Heytesbury Street,
Dublin 8,
Ireland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Did you see the big 300th issue a few months back???  
I think I still sent it to the old address.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm afraid I missed it. It's, er, a while since I moved.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And also let me know your blog URL, I find it amazing
that the Frank's APA continues, it does seem that the APA format
is even more difficult to maintain than the szine format.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The blog URL is: http://inuitbikini.blogspot.com/ . I agree with you
about the APA format. Its big problem is that it is so hard to explain
to people. At least with zines you can just say "I write it, send it
to you, and you read it".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((As far as sending me money, I still use John Harrington to
collect money in GBP is that is easier than dollars.  I've
avoided joining PayPal still.  But if you tell me your blog
URL, I'm happy to continue to send issues.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I would be amazed if blogging was now paying for itself in zines.
Dude. I'm not on paypal either. This caused some friction when I was
last central mailer of Frank's APA, as some people found it very hard
to pay monies any other way - emblematic of our times.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Were you at anything in the Terrastock festival? A couple of the
Frank's APA people were in Providence for it recently.

While I still adore Erin, she's not being quite as innovative recently.
Her first recordings and first concerts were some of the strongest debuts
I've ever experienced.))</i>

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></tr></table><!--hboxt--> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've got lots of openings in the subszines, check them out!!!
Especially, contact Rip Gooch for Railway Rivals,
see Rip's subszine elsewhere in most issues of <i>TAP</i>.
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com and try to entice him to return.
Rip has been a bit missing in action lately, but I am assured that he
SHALL return.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm ready to start a new Breaking Away game, who's interested???
Challenge David Partridge again as he is in, so are 
Brendan Whyte and Alexander Woo.
I also am giving a free spot to Eric Martin.
Anyone else?
Rick Desper is in too.
That leaves us looking for ONE more spot, can I convince someone to take that now???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game of REGULAR Diplomacy if there is enough interest!!!
We have Marc Ellinger (pd), Drew James (pd),Don Williams, and John Crow signed up, only three more to go!!!
Wait, we also have Fred Wiedemeyer in, only two more to go. 
<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.
We have Karl Schmit and Sean O'Donnell on the list, let's get seven!!
It's FREE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly or you can look at them at
www.variantbank.org.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'll try to remember to punch in the rules in the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough and Bruce Edwards are interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, and Dave Partridge are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, we only need FOUR more!

Last chance is gone here, these games never really got going all that far in the
first place.
And I really couldn't get back more than one player in each game and it seemed 
silly to get that many standbys.
Take note Mr. BNC Tom Howell.
Let's start another new Diplomacy game instead.
Who's interested??
Any of you old <i>Ishkibibble</i>ites want to play??
Or should I just drop the free subs I've been giving you all??
Your choice.
Anyone who was a subber to <i>Ishkibibble</i> may join the new regular Diplomacy
game for free, but this is a ONE TIME only offer, get your request in now.
Marc Ellinger already has taken us up on this request.
I want three more to fill that game..... come on, let me call by name who qualifies
for this deal..... Karl Schmit, John Power, Tim Snyder, Fred Wiedemeyer, 
Dave Partridge, Graham Wilson, and Kevin Wilson.
Wait, no, Fred already asked in, see above.....
I also will let it apply to the Modern Diplomacy game I'm trying to start if you'd
rather play in that!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, but rather than hold up
the game anymore, Eric Ozog has agreed to pay attention to the game and
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
We all hope this will be a brief interlude.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that Buddy has finally completed his change of address, with the
slow but steady tortoise move of the US Postal Service.
I have Fall orders in hand from all but one of you, so other than that person,
you just need to let me know if you're changing your orders.
Sorry for the delay!!

1) The FREGT draw is rejected, there are no new proposals.
We're off the draw clock, as seems clear at this point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I mistyped the French orders last time.  It didn't matter, but A Burgundy did 
try to support A Ruhr to Munich, and did not try to support itself to Munich.
