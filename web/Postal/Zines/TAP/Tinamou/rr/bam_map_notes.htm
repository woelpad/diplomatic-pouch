<UL>
<LI>FERRIES: Each ferry can be bought by <u>one</u> player.  Cost: $6 from cash in hand.  Rivals can use a ferry for $6 rent.  Movement: 1 die pip to load, 1 per hex to move, 1 to unload (i.e. 5 total for Kawasaki ferry, 4 for Yokosuka ferry)</LI>
<LI>BULLET TRAINS: Each player may, once per game, declare when he enters a race that he will use a bullet train.  Bullet trains move with a speed of 1d6+3 (i.e. 4,5,6,7,8,9 on a normal die; 5,6,6,7,7,8 on an average die).  To use a bullet train for a Joint Run, at least one player must use his bullet train, but not all involved players need to do so.  This is a subject for negotiation when the players decide to enter as a Joint Run.  In an XRP, each player may choose to use his bullet train or not at his own discretion.</LI>
<LI>Half cities pay $3 each when connected.</LI>
<LI>Minumum race length is 4.</LI>
