<B><U><P>Press:</P>
<P><B>Round 12</B></P>
<P>SPICEBLOW:  Smart investors listen to the Bene Gesserit.  The spiceblow in Doba brought sustained life to SPICEBLOW's clients and enriched stockholders.  Don't you wish you had bought a few shares? </P>
<P><B>Round 7</B></P>
<P>SPICEBLOW:  I think I'm done building, so you guys will have to catch me by winning more races.  I'm only entering three races this turn so you're probably getting a start on closing the margin.</P>
<P>GM: Three's as good as anyone did, you'll have to do better than that to let them catch up!</P>
<P><B>Round 5</B></P>
<P>SPICEBLOW to INVESTORS:  From his undisclosed location at a Very 
Important conference of international business leaders, the SPICEBLOW 
chairman advised investors not to be concerned about the lack of recent 
public communications.  Reports indicate that the first samples of the 
Doba spiceblow are so transcendent that corporate representatives are in 
a mystical state, discovering the future of central African railroading.
And also a change here.
</P>
<P><B>Round 2</B></P>
<P>CONRAD TO ERIC:  Oh, all right, just for fun I'll go north after all (and
lose my shirt, and trousers, and several other things)!
</P>
<P>
(SPICEBLOW to INVESTORS):  The Doba spiceblow connection was completed 
and harvesting is proceeding on schedule.  In completely unrelated news, 
the board approved a loan of company assets (bales of fresh spice, and a 
sandworm) to the company's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P><B>Round 1</B></P>
<P>
(SPICEBLOW to ALL):  We just got psionic notification of a huge blow of 
anti-aging spice in Doba in far southwestest Trans-Chari province.  This 
will enable our railway to keep chugging at full speed -- perhaps even 
manage a breakaway -- in future years when all other railroad operators 
are slowing their cruising speeds and taking frequent breaks for 
refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
(SPICEBLOW to INVESTORS):  Never mind the pundits talking about the 
so-called dot-com boomtowns in the northern part of the country.  The 
recent spice blow will make southwestern Chad the home of Africa's most 
sustainable growth, fueling a huge need for our transportation services. 
  Besides, experts in Australian railway systems know that sandstorms 
periodically bury track laid in desert conditions like the nation's 
interior.  Buy SPICEBLOW stock!
