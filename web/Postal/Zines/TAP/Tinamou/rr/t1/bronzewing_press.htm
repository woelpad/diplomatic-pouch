<P>MIKE to DAVE:  "Kypinka":  Ukrainian to Arabic translation??  How many 
people do that conversion for the words "bathroom" or "rifle", let alone 
"partridge"?  No wonder you stumped the panel.</P>
<P>DAVE to MIKE:  Hey, you expect it to be easy?  Anyone can google nowadays.  Besides, <B>I</B> found
it on Google!</P>
<P>UKR:  "...But I think of great Lobachevsky, and I get idea, aha!<BR>
I have a friend in Minsk, who has a friend in Pinsk,<BR>
whose friend in Omsk has friend in Tomsk, with friend in Okhmolinsk!<BR>
His friend in Alexandrovsk has friend in Petropovlosk,<BR>
whose friend somehow is solving now the problem in Dnyepropetrovsk!<BR>
And when his work is done, ha ha! begins the fun,<BR>
from Dnyepropetrovsk to Petropovlosk<BR>
by way of the East and other assist,<BR>
to Alexandrovsk to Okhmolinsk,<BR>
to Tomsk to Omsk to Pinsk to Minsk to me the news will run..."<BR>
"... and pretty soon my name in Dnyepropetrovsk is cursed when he finds 
out I published first..."<BR>
