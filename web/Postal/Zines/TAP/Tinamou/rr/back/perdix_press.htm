(SPICEBLOW to ALL):  We just got psionic notification of a huge blow of 
anti-aging spice in Doba in far southwestest Trans-Chari province.  This 
will enable our railway to keep chugging at full speed -- perhaps even 
manage a breakaway -- in future years when all other railroad operators 
are slowing their cruising speeds and taking frequent breaks for 
refurbishing.

(SPICEBLOW to INVESTORS):  Never mind the pundits talking about the 
so-called dot-com boomtowns in the northern part of the country.  The 
recent spice blow will make southwestern Chad the home of Africa's most 
sustainable growth, fueling a huge need for our transportation services. 
  Besides, experts in Australian railway systems know that sandstorms 
periodically bury track laid in desert conditions like the nation's 
interior.  Buy SPICEBLOW stock!
