<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Weekly Winner Pick<B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each week, each player submits a team name. If the team does not win that week, the player is eliminated. Players may use a team only once during the season. Last player remaining wins.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Simple Fantasy Football</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each player submits a list of the teams in an ordered list. Teams are then assigned to players as follows:

If only one player has a team as the first choice, the player gets the team. If there are multiple players who choose a team, then if a single player has the lowest resolution score, that player gets the team. If there are multiple players with the same resolution score, then a die roll determines the result. All players start with a resolution score of 0. If a player wins a tie their score is increased by 1. If a player loses a tie, their score is reduced by 1. Players will have two or three teams depending on the number of players in the game. Each week, if the team wins a game, the player who owns the team gains one point. The season is broken into four quarters. Trades for any unclaimed team can be registered at any time during a quarter although they only take place when the new quarter starts. Thus a player who begins the game with the Bills and registers a trade of the Bills for the Jets on week 2 will continue to score the Bills until week 5, at which point the new quarter starts and the Jets begin to score for that player. As soon as the trade was registered in week 2, the Bills became available for other players to trade for. A team traded away during a quarter can not be acquired again during the same quarter. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the season
