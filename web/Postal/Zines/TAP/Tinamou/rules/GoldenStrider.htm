<h1>The Golden Strider Rules (Game designed by Alan Parr)</h1>
<UL>
<LI>
The Golden Strider is an athletics-based game (1500 meters is the nominal distance) in which the basic premise is that any middle distance runner cannot hope to rely simply upon speed alone. The runner must trade off some of his energy for stamina, to which should be added a tactical awareness that will let him keep just behind the pacemakers.  </LI>
<LI>Six to ten players may take part, although eight is probably the ideal number. Each player starts with five cards, whose values are specified by the player, each card having a minimum value of one (1), a maximum value of ten (10) and the total of the five cards being exactly thirty (30).  </LI>
<LI>Each turn, players simultaneously play one card. Each player must stipulate how much of the value of the card is to be used for moving and how much is to be banked and used as stamina. Runners may also need to pay overtaking costs.  </LI>
<LI>No overtaking costs are levied the first two rounds, but after that, players must pay one movement point for each place their race position improved in the previous round. For example, a move from seventh to sixth equal is regarded as one place. Overtaking costs will be given first priority, and if a card lower in value than the overtaking costs are specified by the player, the GM, if possible, will substitue that players lowest value card which will fully repay the overtaking charge.  </LI>
<LI>After each turn, each runner receives a replacement card with a value between zero and ten. The value of this card will be determined by doubling the amount banked and adding a positional bonus based on the runner's race position at the end of the turn. No bonus is given to the leader (or joint leaders), 1 is given to 2nd and 3rd place, 2 is given to 4th-6th, while any others receive nothing since they are deemed to be out of touch with the leaders. The highest card possible is a 10.  </LI>
<LI>No card may be held more than seven turns.  </LI>
<LI>The winner will be the first runner to reach, or pass, 60 spaces. If two or more runners pass the finish line in the same turn, the winner is the runner to move farthest past in that turn. If more than one runner reaches the same space beyond the finish in the same turn, the winner will be the faster moving runner (i.e., the one having moved more spaces that turn). If they moved the same number of spaces, the race will be considered a draw.  </LI>
<LI>A player failing to submit orders will have their oldest card of lowest value played. Overtaking costs will be deducted, if necessary, then the remaining points will be divided equally between movement and stamina, the odd point going to movement.  </LI>
