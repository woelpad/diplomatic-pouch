<br /><br />Hi all, this was going to be a quick and slim issue.  Don't throw out the last
big fat one, keep reading it too.... but then the end of summer came up.  And 
a combination of work and vacation delayed this.
Since we jumped up to the September 6th deadline, I decided to pick up a 
couple of games TO that deadline, while others were delayed three weeks.
See below to see what happened to your game.
Note that I do have a regular Diplomacy game opening.
Yes, it really has been two years since I was grounded in Chicago by a ground stop.
And it's about enough time to stop enabling fear mongering.
We're all Diplomacy players, we understand that game.
I'm as sensitive as the next person, but there's a difference from respecting
and remembering the past (I'd like the world to keep remembering Strong Vincent
too - see below - but I hope America is finally past still fighting and refighting
the Civil War) and wallowing in fear mongering.
That's how I feel this September 11th, two years later.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have subszines from Harold Reynolds and from Rip Gooch.
The 2003 Diplomacy Hobby Awards Ballot is contained herein!
Please vote quickly as deadline is October 1.
I've already announced this widely on the Internet and have received over
50 votes already, but I want YOURS!
Don't worry if you don't know ALL of the ballot nominees.
Hardly anyone does.
But please vote for things that you think are noteworthy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And, Ms. Erin McKeown's record <i><b>Grand</b></i> continues to pile up 
kudos and international recognition.  This could really break my favorite
unknown artist of recent years.  All of you have to go out and find the record.
She has a compelling Judy Garland style (a comparison not made lightly) about
her, with unique jazz influenced guitar chops, and a way of songwriting that
cuts you to the heart without being maudlin.
This stuff really is difficult to categorize, is it rock, folk, jazz?  Or the
beginning of something a bit new?  I don't know, but I don't really care either.
Go pick up a listen!
And go see her live if you can, where if anything she is even more impressive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lastly for the up-front stuff.  I'm not going to be able to go to North American
DipCon on Columbus Day weekend.
I'm now pretty permanently booked on Memorial Day (put in the docks),
Fourth of July (Lake Association Meeting), Labor Day (take out the docks),
and Columbus Day (look at the brilliant leaves and close up the house)
with my new summer house in Maine.
I've really enjoyed it this summer, but it does put a crimp in the Diplomacy
convention plans for those having cons on those weekends if you want me to attend.
But you all should go to North American DipCon this Columbus Day weekend, 
E-Mail Andy Bartalone right now for the latest info at: buffalo of guisarme.net.

<br /><br />The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has one opening, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR STEVE KNIGHT - FOUND, HURRAY!!!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yes, yes, we have some adept hunters out there and Steven Knight (the
key if you were Googling) has been found.
I'll have a new target set up for next issue, suggestions and requests
are always cheerfully accepted.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<br /><br />  <b>Rian Mitra (around Sept. 1 sent to one Steven Knight)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was wondering if you are the same Steve Knight that started the <i>Mad
as Hell</i> 'zine, in the early 80's.  If you are not, please disregard
this email and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
There is an online 'zine run by Jim Burgess called <i>The Abyssinian
Prince</i>:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
/Postal/Zines/TAP/</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
and he is trying to track down some of the individuals
who were involved in the early days of the hobby.  Your
name is one of the people he is currently trying to find

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
/Postal/Zines/TAP/abyss271.html</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a scavenger hunt of sorts, with the readers trying to find
the people identified.  If you want to be found, you just need to
send an email to Jim ( burgess of world.std.com ) with a letter that he
will print in the next issue.  You get a lifetime subscription to his
'zine.  The choice is up to you whether you want to come forward or not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Steven Knight (Sep 02, 2003 10:58:37 PM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Rian- 
Yep, you found me-thanks for doing so!  I'll CC: Jim on this reply so
you can get the credit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm flattered to be considered someone worth tracking down.  Jim's
description of me as "famous" just for having tried to run a PBEM game
back in 1982 made me laugh out loud...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I don't know if you've done it, but all that early stuff back in 
1982 can be Googled itself because you were using the precursor to Usenet,
UUCP, and Google picked all that up and somehow, in a way that escapes
me, is all archived and searchable.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nevertheless, seeing as how Jim first announced trying to find me back
in May, I'm a little surprised that it took this long for someone to
succeed.  I actually have a pretty strong presence on the Internet, at
least within certain computer geek circles.  I suppose what makes it
non-trivial is that I started going by "Steven" about ten years ago,
which is how I'm listed on most current pages, but still, half of the
top 10 Google entries for "Steven Knight" are mine, and I'm right at the
top of the list if you Google for "Steven Knight" and "Olaf"...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Olaf, of course, I even told them that's where you went to school!!
See, my hints will get you far if you use them!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Taking a look at Jim's recent issues of <i>TAP</i> were a great trip down
memory lane.  I'm amazed at how many names I remember:  Mark Luedi, Gary
Coughlan, John Caruso, Dick Martin, Mike Barno...  So pardon me while I
engage in a little self-indulgent rambling...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Go right ahead, that's what this exercise is all about.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>MAD AS HELL</i> and the game therein (I don't even remember the Boardman
number) died a relatively swift death, mainly because UUCP (the Usenet
transmission method in the '80s) was not reliable enough.  It was still
very novel to get a message within minutes of its sending, although it
wasn't unheard of if you were emailing someone from a "neighboring"
site; typically, messages would take hours or days to get queued up
and transmitted through all the systems.  We had an NMR right away in
Spring '01, and it only got worse from there.  Because everything over
UUCP was transmitted through multiple hops and by the grace of the
companies/universities running the machines, you had no way of knowing
if the NMR was really due to someone not submitting their moves, or due
to a communication problem with an intervening system.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Believe it or not, I had never played a postal Diplomacy game before
trying to run the <i>MAD AS HELL</i> game, although I was aware of the
postal hobby from things like Rod Walker's Avalon Hill booklet.  Jim
Grosch (Germany in the MAD AS HELL game) published a 'zine "Dogs of
War," and introduced me to the "formal" postal hobby.  From that, I
ended up fairly active in the PBM hobby during the 80's, reviving the
International Subscription Exchange for a while, and publishing my own
print 'zine, "It's a Trap!" which ran for 16 or 17 issues.  I had always
admired the writing in the British hobby and tried to maintain good ties
there, and I believe "It's a Trap!" was, if not the first, one of the
first American 'zines to run a league of Alan Parr's postal soccer game,
"United."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unfortunately, I ended up flaming out in typical comet-zine fashion.
Once the novelty of being a new publisher wore off, my interest waned
and I ended up leaving the postal hobby in the late 80's, and not very
gracefully at that:  I orphaned my games and just dwindling away,
leaving subscribers to wonder what the hell happened.  I can only hope
that enough time has passed that there aren't still any hard feelings
out there...  (In fact, I believe I still owe someone in Britain money
for ISE subscriptions that I never forwarded-I'd be more than happy to
settle up after all these years if the right person steps forward.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I've got all the ISE records that were passed to me somewhere,
and if my very poor memory serves, didn't Pete Gaughan pick up the ISE
after you?  If so, I think he corrected a lot of those issues, at
least that's what I recall.
You may well hear from Pete after this.... and I don't think anyone 
worries about flameouts any more.
We're more relaxed these days, at least I am.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After Diplomacy, I became very active in early music (medieval
and renaissance music) in the Twin Cities, and maintained a
semi-professional hobby career in the '90s as a tenor with groups such
as the Rose Ensemble and the Dale Warland Singers.  In fact, if you
check out the Rose Ensemble site:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm still in the slightly out-of-date publicity photo on the front page,
just to the left of the big white column in the middle, looking back
over my shoulder from 3/4 view.  I stopped singing actively about two
years ago, though, due to combined work and family demands on time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Speaking of family, I've been married for seven years now and have a
five-year-old daughter who's just starting kindergarten.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Throughout all of this, my day jobs have always been with computers.
During the '80s I was working for Cray Research.  I left them in 1993
to join a local startup, NetStar, that was making the first commercial
Internet router with a switched backplane.  NetStar got bought by
Ascend Communications, and I left in 1998 to co-found a company with
two of the other engineers there.  That company was bought by Optical
Solutions, which I left last year.  I'm currently Director of Networking
and Management Software for Caspian Networks, another company trying to
leapfrog high-end Cisco Systems routers with cutting-edge technology.  I
have groups reporting to me in San Jose, Minnesota and North Carolina,
so I travel a lot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Outside of work, I'm currently mostly involved in leading and doing
most of the programming for SCons (http://www.scons.org), an Open
Source software project to create a software program that controls how
programmers build software more efficiently and effectively.  SCons is
based on work I submitted which won a programming design competition in
August 2000.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Last:  Being the pack rat I am, I still have a *lot* of zines from the
80s boxed up, including some collections of British zines from the era
that were passed on to me.  I'd hate to see them trashed after all this
time, so if there are any historians of the postal Diplomacy hobby out
there who would be interested in giving a good home to these zines, I
would gladly pay the shipping cost.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim, I have no idea what, if any, of the above would be of interest to
people, so feel free to edit down any of it that's too self-indulgent.
I'd actually be glad to exchange greetings with people who might
actually remember me, so I don't have a problem with your letting people
have my contact info.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rian, thanks again for tracking me down...!

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
-SK, knight of baldmt.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Hooray!!!  Thank you Rian.  Both of you need to provide me with
Postal addresses so I can send you things.  Steven gets a free
lifetime subscription and Rian at least gets a few issues, plus
his monetary prize that he has to use for some Diplomacy related
activity.
Be assured, Steve, that I will print your entire letter, since
I found the whole thing fascinating.  I also am the current ISE
person, so we'll see if we can do anything with that.  I do have
the old file cabinets with the old records somewhere.
This whole thing is GREAT fun to me, and I always like it when
someone is found!  John Michalski continues to be irascible 
about complaining that I'm filling his mailbox, but I enjoy doing it!
So, this is great, thanks again Rian for the "easy find".   I myself
had trouble figuring out what the "other" entry in the Google search
should be.  And somehow I overlooked or forgot about your interest
in music.  I am a much less trained baritone myself who loves to
sing in my church choir and I have a very extensive early music
record collection.  Mark Lew (who is a much more trained singer,
mostly Opera in the Bay Area) and I have had long discussions in
past years about singing in the pages of <b>TAP</b>.  We're a lot less
music oriented these days than we used to be.
Feel free to change that.
Wow, I love these notes out of the blue!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I kept up with Pete Gaughan for a long time, but lost track of him in the

much daily.  In fact, he was looking for the latest (or last?) Dragon's Tooth 
Rating System publication.  Any ideas on where to find that?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm also curious if anyone has heard anymore from Brux.  I did see David Hood 
someplace online not too long ago, but not many other hobby folk.  Glad to 
see you are still busy and involved.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this

into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl

But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

We also have reopened a branch office of the International

Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub

We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.

WorldMasters 2002 Email Diplomacy Tournament First Round has ended and
the selections for Round 2 have been made.
Here are some of the "players" of interest who have advanced to Round 2,
in order of their point score from Round 1: Tim Sweeney (who led tied with Martin
Sanders!), Ray Setzer (who soloed the game I GMed), Brian Dennehy, Toby Harris,
Kevin Wilson (see below), Lee Simpson, Jack "Trojan Owl" Brawner (yes, really!),
Rod Spade, Len Tennant, Brain Sheldon, Mark Wightman, Adam Silverman, Sean "Blue"
Cable, Chetan Radia, Egbert "Egg" Ferreira, David Cohen, Steve Cooley, 
Vincent Carry, Steve Emmert, Eric Grinnell, Chris Martin, Greg Ellis (is that "our"
Greg Ellis, I'm really not sure....), Rick Desper, Frank Johansen, and Randy Hudson.
Round 2 looks like it will be REALLY hard fought, as the riff-raff has been 
chaffed out.  I haven't had enough time lately to verify this for myself directly,
but indirectly it seems to have led to a number of new creative diplomatic ploys
that are dastardly indeed (as I've heard from various parties talking to me 
about them, but I wouldn't dare reveal them in public here).  You can get yourself
more information on the new Yahoo Group.  See below.

Looks like this [ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wm02-chat/ ] will be
Nathan Detroit's new home. Too bad the BBS didn't work out, but it kept going down.
I see from the Team Tournament database that the Green Mountain Boys have
lept into the lead in the early going of Round 2. Everyone thought the
Riders would be uncatchable, but they slid to 3rd place. Still, it's early
and its tough to tell if this indicates some serious get the leader
campaigns or not.

A special place for WM links has been set up, and our dedicated Linkmaster,
Ian Cowburn will be updating the table with links to all the game maps he
can find. This table will be the the Worldmasters general home page at

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together last Fall's issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.
I've heard almost nothing on this lately, so it is getting close to going away,
but who knows, someone may get frisky.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I finally saw "The Pianist" on DVD.  Really good - the best Holocaust
movie I've seen.  (But I haven't seen "Shoah".)  Worlds better than
"Schindler's List", which was just repulsive.  Spielberg movies
always have a feeling of "look how wonderful this movie is". 
Polanski did a much better job.  He had all of the gruesome images
but didn't insulate the viewer with fake melodrama or suspense. 
(Also, he didn't insist on having a happy ending.)  The historical
accuracy regarding Warsaw was very good.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other DVD I've seen recently that is terrific is "Spirited Away".
The title is silly, but the movie is great.  When it was in cinemas,
I kept confusing it with that horse movie titled "Spirit".  Again,
this is a really, really good movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I saw "Memento" on DVD and was a bit disappointed.  Why?  Well, when
I played the scenes backward (i.e., forward in time), the movie made
no sense, esp. the actions of Joe Pantoliano.  And of course the main
character is completely unbelievable.  (Who could function in life
without the ability to make new memories?  Apparently Guy Pearce
can!)
<i>((As a costume designer, Charlotte has to be able to think about
such things and she told me as we were watching it that it would make
no sense actually played backwards.
She was annoyed by it.
She was right, I'm annoyed by it too now, though I admit to being a bit
captivated at the time.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I keep seeing "Donnie Darko" on HBO, and it keeps getting
better and better.  (Not to be confused with "Donnie Brasco" with
Depp and Pacino or, for that matter, "Johnny Bravo" on the cartoon
network.)  I've figured out the whole plot arc in this movie and it
finally makes sense.  (More than most time travel movies do.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Summer movies:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Matrix - very good.  I have an inkling about how this series will
turn out, but it's just a guess.  (And no, it doesn't involve Bobby
Ewing coming out of the shower.)  Best parts involved the albino twin
vampire/wraiths.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Charlie's Angels - would probably have been better with the sound off.
I mean, it's hard to complain about a movie featuring Cameron Diaz in
a bikini, but this comes close.  John Cleese added nothing to the
movie - why was he there?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pirates of the Caribbean - the best popcorn movie of the summer. 
Johnny Depp, who easily could have mailed this in, didn't, and that
makes all the difference.  The premise is silly, but the plot isn't
bad given that constraint, and it has some nice twists that were
unexpectedly clever.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Italian Job - lot of fun.  Wahlberg was unimpressive, but Theron was
good, and Ed Norton was great, as always.  Seth Green has a few good
lines.  Mini Cooper chase is neat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lara Croft II:  actually I thought this one was better than Lara
Croft I.  (Perhaps because Jolie's ditched Billy Bob Thornton and is
thus more available?  But Billy Bob could be a bad stalker - I
picture him walking in dressed as Karl Childers carrying a "sling
blade".)   
<i>((Damn, I was afraid of that, I really wanted to see this one,
but my wife [who went with me to see LC I] would not go.  Why not?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Swimming Pool - my concession to see a French/English film about a
teenage French girl who likes swimming naked and shocking her
father's writer friend.  Reasonably good, with one problem.  Ads say
"you won't believe the twist at the end!"  Well, not only will I
believe it, I can pretty much predict what it will be.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Haven't seen T3, Seabiscuit, Bad Boys II, or Finding Nemo, and don't
plan on seeing any of them soon.  
<i>((T3 and Seabiscuit were OK, but a bit disappointing, esp.
Seabiscuit.
They entirely lost any sense of plot in it, so that you felt like
you were seeing staged vignettes, instead of a movie.
Some nice production design, though.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm trying to remember the last time there was a "twist" that I
didn't suss out.  I figured out the one in Vanilla Sky.  (Pretty
obvious given that it was a Philip K. Dick story).  I think the last
ones that surprised me were "The Crying Game" and "The Usual
Suspects".  That's why I try to see movies quickly before stupid
reviewers blow it for me.
<i>((Yeah, though Charlotte and I both spotted the twist in the
Crying Game, Usual Suspects was THE best twist of all time.))</i>
Or worse, over-long trailers.  (The trailer for "The Italian Job"
features Charlize Theron punching Ed Norton in the face - which
happens in the very last minute of the movie!)
<i>((Sigh, I would like to see GOOD trailers, and wipe out these
"put all the best stuff and the twist spoilers in the trailer"
style that they seem to think will market movies most successfully.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is almost as bad as the "figure out who the killer is" problem
in a movie with only one significant supporting actor.  Examples: 
Blood Work, Minority Report, and From Hell.  I saw those three movies
in quick succession.  By the time I saw "Blood Work", I was like,
"gee, what's Jeff Daniels doing in such a low-profile role in an
Eastwood movie - is he that hard up for work?"  (snicker, snicker) 
It's better when the moviemakers bother to hire a few more actors,
like in The Usual Suspects.  I mean, sure, Kevin Pollak can't possibly be
Kaiser Sozay, but what about Gabriel Byrne?   I really think it would
have been neat if they'd had alternate endings, a la "Clue".  Perhaps
for the DVD version?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think this "Alternate Ending" idea has some legs to it.  Think
about "Do the Right Thing", but Mookie doesn't throw the trash can
through the window of the pizza store, but instead he puts it down
and Danny Aiello pats him on the back and says "You did the right
thing".  In the alternate ending for "Pearl Harbor", the American
carriers show up at the end and sink the Japanese fleet.  (Why not
just abandon any pretense of historical accuracy?)  
<i>((Has some promise....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Baseball:  48 hours ago, I was quite depressed, but the Sox rallied
to win the last two in Oakland, and things look competitive again. 
They have the hitting, and I think the bullpen's OK.  They really
need starters other than Pedro to step up and pitch well.  Also, it
would be nice if the Mariners fell back to their level along with the
A's.  I'm quite pleased that Aaron Boone is playing so poorly in the
Bronx.  It really offends me that the Yankees can just pluck
All-Stars from other teams at will.  And the talk about signing Vlad
Guerrero as if it is their right.  Small wonder interest in MLB is
fading.  I think Yankees' starters are still their weak point.  Wells
and Clemens are too old and Weaver just isn't that good.  Neither
Pettite nor Mussina is truly dominant, except on occasions.

<i>((Let's see some of what Goz has to say about that.... but I agree,
at this writing the Sox are almost safely in the playoffs, with the
Mariners and A's facing that killer march of two straight weekend
home and home series with each other.
Six losses that one or the other of them must take and there isn't
much room for the Red Sox most likely or the Yankees for sure to
fall behind both.
Everyone's flawed, whoever gets hot at the end will win the World Series.
It is virtually impossible to know who that will be, though my real
smart money is on the Giants.  Wouldn't a Giants/Cubs NLCS be interesting?
What about a Yankees/Red Sox ALCS?  Well, if you force me, those would be
my predictions.  But I'll go on the bandwagon of whoever gets hot these
last few weeks for prediction.
The rooting all is with the Giants and Red Sox.
What if they meet in the WS, as I think I predicted back in April?
Arrrgh, my all time favorite team, the Giants, vs. the team I do the day-to-day
rooting for, the Red Sox.
I hope just one makes it and then my rooting will be clear.
Can you hear me now?))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I got Goz going with this: Goz, Feel free to convince me about 
how I don't get it.
But my view is that the Yankees won those titles because
they managed (through a combination of luck and skill)
to get both on and off the field leadership that was
successful.  They still have the off the field leadership
and that isn't enough.  It gets them to the Division titles.
That's where they're headed this year too.
The Royals have a better chance of winning the World Series
THIS year than the Yankees do.
You don't get it, people are what matter, not money.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Wed, 6 Aug 2003 22:38:26 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,
Sorry about the time lag since the last missive.  I'd forgotten how busy 
you can get with a job.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It seems to me that, when we last left things, you were trying to 
convince me that the Yankees, with 4 Series' titles in the last 8 years, 
had a worse chance come playoff time than the Royals, who have a 28-35 
record outside their division.  I'm still puzzling out that one.  I 
don't think I can.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I still believe that, even today, though admittedly, the 
Royals probably only have about a 2% chance to win the World Series
this year while the Yankees have about a 1% chance.
Just for fun, here are all my current prior probability percentages:
Giants at 40, Red Sox at 25, Braves, A's, Mariners, Twins, White Sox,
and Cubs all at about 5 (see above, the posterior probabilities as
one or more of these teams get hot at the end of the season will rise
substantially), with the remaining 2% going around to anyone else
who might get into the playoffs from the NL.  
I've listed all of the AL possibilities.
Right now (before I see who gets hot at the end), I see myself having
about a 2/3 chance of being REALLY happy.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Last I looked the Royals had a starting rotation held together with spit 
and glue, and that won't work against Seattle, or New York, or even 
Boston.  As it stands now, their pitching has been exposed the last ten 
days against the White Sox, who have finally turned into the team that 
most thought they'd be in March.  Granted the Sox have problems (no 
closer, no centerfielder, and a shortstop that has an arm that should 
come with a warning label), but they are far fewer than KC.  Heck, in 
looking at things this year, every team has a problem someplace.  It's 
just that the Yankees can still afford to keep trying to fill their 
holes well past the trading deadline.  And that's the crux of the 
problem...
<i>((Yeah, really?
Well, I don't think it is purely money.
The Mariners have a LOT of money, but they can't grab anyone because
their farm system is TOTALLY depleted.
The Red Sox are still pretty close to that situation too.
The new collective bargaining agreement is doing its job, you'll see.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let's make a deal here Jim-Bob:  we'll have 2 fantasy contests next 
year.  In the first one, we'll play fantasy baseball.  I get 3 times the 
money to play with that you get.  In the second one we'll play fantasy 
NASCAR.  You get 3 times the money to play with that I get.  I'm willing 
to bet that I, and anyone else still reading, can guess the outcomes, 
even though you think I know less about baseball than you think you know 
about auto racing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Can I just pick Kurt Busch to win every race?
I don't know who any of the other current NASCAR racers are.
Richard Petty isn't still racing, is he?
And do we just pick races, or is there some kind of overall champion?
I don't think this is fair, I DO believe you know FAR more about
baseball than I know about Auto Racing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So let's analyze the current standings:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL has Giants in the West, Braves in the East, and a jumble in the 
Central.  I still think that Houston has fewer holes than St. Louis, but 
the Cubs look like they have just enough to break my heart around 
September 20th or so.  Wild Card is a wild thing, but I'll pick Philly 
to hold off everyone long enough to get swept first round.  Braves get 
to be the visitors in Game 1 of the WS.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL has Seattle holding Oakland at arms' length in the West, the Red Sox 
staying close enough to the Yankees to be in it until about September 
20th in the East, and a jumble in the Central.  It looks like Chicago 
wins that by default, but I'll be surprised if they have to win 85 games 
to do it.  Wild Card is a tossup between Oakland and the Bosox.  Yankees 
get to host Game 1 of the WS, and win it in 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How does that compare with what I said in April?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I don't know, it's on the website, why don't you go look?
I know this particular note is a bit old, but I would have said then
and still say now that one will need 87-88 wins minimum to get
the AL Central, though 85 might be enough in the NL Central.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(As an aside, there is no truth to the rumor that all the perogi vendors 
in Pittsburgh are now wearing name tags that say, "Randall Simon".)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can we get Mark Cuban to buy the Texas Rangers?  I bet that would shake 
up things in a positive way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

I never got a good answer to this one.  We're now after the Sept. 1
playoff eligibility deadline and all George got was guys who are
underperforming, even Boone, who I think is only batting .256 
since joining the Yankees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't think *I* got a good answer.  The last time I checked the biggest 
problem that everyone said the Yankees had was that they had no one to get 
them outs #22, #23 and #24 of any individual game.  Man, every team should 
have that as their biggest problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((But it is a big problem, especially when someone also can't
get outs 19-21!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So we'll have to see come October what happens.  My math training tells me 
that if the Yankees continue to play at a .600 pace, they won't have a 
problem, so don't cry for them.
<i>((I'm not crying for them, I'm just saying that they ain't goin' anywhere
in the playoffs once they get there.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On another note, let's look at something else here...
The Cubs are in 1st place.
The White Sox are tied for 1st place.
The Red Sox are currently in a playoff spot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The question is:  which of these are the 7th sign?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, Petey and the boys beat the Mariners again today, to sweep them
out of town and tie their record.  Something the baseball columnists
have not paid complete attention to is the fact that the Sox only
need to beat the A's OR the Mariners.  If the Mariners fall apart
(which they've been doing lately), that will suffice.
<i>((That's where it's going, and if they come back and make a
run, they'll have to do it at the expense of the A's... only one
team from the AL West this year, almost guaranteed as of this week.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It was very annoying last week to read about people "doubting"
whether Pedro could have pitched when he had an infection and a 101
temperature.  Numbskulls like Dan Shaughnessey are the kind of people
who drive good players out of town.  Gammons is great, but
Shaughnessey brings nothing to the table.  He has no special
insights, he just whines and moans when players don't want to talk to him.
<i>((Boy, ain't that the truth!
Petey almost deserves the Cy Young when he ends up with most strikeouts,
best ERA, and something like a 14-5 record.
He won't get it, but it wouldn't be an upset for him to beat out Loaiza.))</i>  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So...after reaching despondency five days ago, I'm now convinced that
the Sox will make the playoffs.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
a) the Mariners are falling apart

<div class="p"><!----></div>
b) Mulder was the A's ace this season, and the A's are so
pitching-oriented they'll be hard-pressed to make up for that loss

<div class="p"><!----></div>
c) the Sox finish against the O's and the Devil Rays, while the
Mariners and A's play each other for 6 games out of the last 9.  This
is why it's so great that the Sox have caught the A's - if they are
still even going into the last week, they will be unlikely to fall
behind two teams playing head-to-head.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Seabiscuit" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a really big story.  Lots of it early on is told in visual shorthand. 
Very sort clips moving quickly through time, leaving the actual story 
development up to the audience.  Nice technique actually.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, but it also made it difficult to really get into the characters.
I kinda liked the young Pollard better than the older one that was in most
all of the movie.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is based on a true story, obviously.  Seabiscuit is the little engine 
who could.  He was a discard horse, who had been trained to be an also ran.  He 
was a scrub essentially.  He had some good blood.  His grandfather was Man o' 
War, the greatest horse of all time, but Seabiscuit was barely fourteen hands 
at the shoulder, as compared to the eighteen hands of his grandfather.  In 
racing, size usually counts.  Small horses can sometimes sprint well, they can 
turn on a dime as it were, and they frequently have stamina for a long run, but 
they also have to take five steps to a larger horse's four, and that is a 
significant disadvantage in a race.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, a horse too small to be taken seriously.  Then there is his jockey.  Red 
Pollard was a depression child, essentially abandoned by his family, forced to 
live from day to day through whatever he could put his hand to.  He was good 
with horses, but was large for a jockey.  He could ride, but had to starve 
himself to keep his weight down.  He also fought in club fights.  He lost the 
sight in one eye in one such fight.  So, a too small horse, and a too large jockey 
who was also blind in one eye.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The competition.  War Admiral was the son of Man o' War.  He was nearly as 
large as his father, measuring eighteen hands.  A hand by the way is four 
inches.  Thats a difference of sixteen inches in height at the shoulders between the 
two horses.  War Admiral had already won the Triple Crown.  He was considered 
to be the best horse in the world at that time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Seabiscuit was the darling of the little man.  He was touted by his owner as 
being the kind of horse who went out and did his best day after day, whether 
he won or not, despite being the little guy.  Of course, he also won a lot of 
small races in a row.  He was loved by most of America as being their champion 
against the rich.  His owner was a car salesman, not a millionaire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, public opinion demanded that War Admiral give Seabiscuit a race.  
War Admiral's owner was far from pleased.  He had nothing to win and lots to 
lose.  If War Admiral beat Seabiscuit, it would be no more than expected, and if 
by some miracle he lost, it would be devastating to the price of War Admiral's 
future stud fees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bad bit of casting in the race by the way.  Remember that sixteen inches 
difference at the shoulders.  Well the two horses they chose to play the parts in 
the race were nearly of a size.   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Great story.  Movie wasn't bad, either.

<i>((As noted above, I liked it less than you did since I felt the grand story
telling overshadowed the characterizations.
In many ways, William H. Macy stole the movie.
He was wonderful and might earn a Supporting Actor nomination.
The three high profile "stars" (playing the jockey, trainer, and owner)
did not seem to do their best work and came off as flat characters.))</i>

"S. W. A. T."   ===== a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was fun to watch.  I didn't watch the TV show that it is based on so I
can't say how close to the original this came.  There was an origin story for
the first three quarters of the movie, how this S.W.A.T team was put together,
trained, who they were.  In parallel there was a story about the Police
Captain who didn't like them.  The writers selected to make him very slick and not
very smart.  I think that was a poor choice.  If he were smart he would have
been a much more effective character.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Great action, occasionally confusing, but things happened quickly.  Simple
computer effects, unless the Lear jet landing on the bridge was done in a
computer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm really becoming a Colin Farrell fan.

"The Order" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Going in I had a problem with the ads which projected Heath Ledger as a young 
disillusioned priest.  My problem is that he is barely old enough to be a 
priest and not nearly old enough to be disillusioned yet.  Now, some of us are 
born disillusioned, but we are not likely to become priests.  Priests are more 
of the idealistic optimistic turn, harder to disillusion than most.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway the movie is not well served by the misleading ad.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Heath Ledger was raised by a priest.  A Carolingian Monk, one of the last of 
that order.  They deal with exorcism, with driving the demons and the hell 
spawn from the physical world.  Ledger plays Alex Bernier, a young idealistic 
priest, who has seen more evil and fought more evil than the church is willing to 
admit exists.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story is marvelously complex.  I still find myself making small leaps of 
understanding about things that went a bit over my head as they slipped past.  
Along with a good plot there were very good characters, and dialogue.  Good 
writing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just enough computer special effects to make it work.
I very much liked it.

at the time I'd seen this review there were virtually no other ones available.

"The Medallion"  === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jackie Chan is best at comic action.  In "The Medallion" he opts for action 
hero, leaving the comedy pretty much to Lee Evans who plays the part of an 
Interpol Agent who is inept right up there with "Johnnie English".  Not actually 
all that funny.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Claire Forlani is the pretty girl.  She usually plays the delicate sensitive 
heroine.  She is a lot more attractive as the smiling super hero actually.  
Everyone in the movie seemed to be a black belt of some school or other.  The 
story made little sense.  The medallion in the title has the power to overcome 
death and induce super powers in the recipient.  Julian Sands plays the evil 
villain who wants such power.  Inexplicably he has a whole bunch of bad guys 
willing to commit all sorts of crimes to make his dream come true.  You have to 
ask, do they think he is a nut, or do they think he will become super powerful? 
If the former, why not get a different boss, if the latter, why not take the 
medallion for themselves?  Doesn't seem to occur to any of them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lee Evans is an Interpol agent by day and at home a librarian.  At one point 
in the story the good guys decide that the bad guys will attempt to kill his 
family (not for any reason I was able to grasp) and sure enough they arrived in 
the nick of time to be met by a ninja gunfighter force.  By this time Jackie 
has super powers, but it is the librarian wife who surproses everyone by 
hauling out an arsenal of armor and weaponry, which her husband didn't know about, 
and then blowing the bad guys away.  Where she got the fighting talent and 
arsenal was never explained.  Maybe librarians are more exciting people than I 
had come to believe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The real problem with the movie is that Jackie Chan is famous for his 
impossible physical stunts.  There were so many wire assisted, camera assisted, 
computer assisted stunts that Jackie becomes just another action hero, not the 
stunt genius we have come to love.

"Open Range" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kevin Costner is still trying to make another really good movie.  He had 
success with a sort of western before.  He sort of has done well with "Open 
Range".  It misses though.  There are two all too simple stories.  Boy meets girl, 
boy courts girl, boy gets girl.  Not a gripping plot.  Cowboy rides into town, 
town is controlled by an evil strong man, cowboy and strongman fight, cowboy 
wins.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Okay, story lines aside.  What the movie has going for it is one very good 
gunfight.  That is what the western is all about really, and "Open Range" 
delivers.

"Uptown Girls" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sweet, Sad, Funny - Killer combination.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Britney Murphy as "Molly Gunn" the little girl who never grew up after her
rock star parents died in a plane crash.  Dakota Fanning as "Ray" the little
girl who has skipped childhood in response to her father being in a coma. 
Molly becomes Ray's nanny when she suddenly becomes penniless and has to work
for a living.  Ray teaches Molly how to be an adult while Molly teaches Ray how
to be a kid. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dakota Fanning is an amazing actress.  The very neurotic Ray becomes a very
real complex person by the end of the film.  I can think of a few adults who do
not act as convincingly.

"To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are 
to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and 
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public." -Theodore Roosevelt, 7 
May 1918

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, Rich, indeedy do!  I believe that I was asking this THREE years
ago, but I did ask!  I would like to see and print the pictures
in <b>TAP</b>, if you please.
I've just been reading the relatively new biography of Joshua
Chamberlain which has me thinking about Strong Vincent again.
I really do think he is the most underrated hero of the entire war,
mostly because he had the poor fortune to get killed right after
he made all those quick brilliant decisions.
The basic idea, for those not familiar with the outlines or details of the
story was that General Warren was up on Little Round Top and realized that
a brigade needed to be sent up there on the second day of Gettysburg
or the entire Union line would be turned and the battle would be lost.
After that, the entire war could have been lost.
General Warren sent for the brigade through the command structure, but
Strong Vincent intercepted the order before it went through his commander,
General Barnes, and took his brigade to Little Round Top on his own authority.
This could have been courtmartial behavior, if later judged to be foolhardy
or if some higher officer were looking for someone to blame for a defeat.
That was one thing, then he set his brigade perfectly (including making a 
last second split decision to put the 20th Maine on the extreme left) to 
fend off an attack that went all the way across the hill's western and
southern slopes.
He was killed on the western slope leading the battle.
He could be viewed as the greatest hero of the north in that war, not
just because of what I just said, but because he began a flip flop of
aggressiveness, in his HOME state of Pennsylvania, that eventually 
changed the whole attitude of the war.
Before this, northern troops were sluggish in maneuver and easy for
Lee to exploit with daring cross marches.
After this, that became less and less possible for Lee and he started
to lose battles, or at least fail to win them, which was enough.))</i>

"On the 21st of this month the Galileo Space Probe, which has been 
orbiting Jupiter for nearly eight years, will plummet fatefully  into 
the crushing pressures and searing heat of that planet's interior. The 
spacecraft's 14 year journey has brought the discovery of, among other 
things, the first moon  orbiting an asteroid, the first remote detection 
of life on earth when Carl Sagan used data from an onboard infrared 
spectrometer to observe the spectral signature of Oxygen in our 
atmosphere, it has caught snowflakes of Sulfur Dioxide as it flew 
through the plume of an erupting volcano on Io, snapped  pictures of 
comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 as it smashed into Jupiter's atmosphere and most 
importantly, provided proof a &#62;60 Km deep ocean on Europa with hints of 
oceans on Callisto and Ganymede(listen to Ganymede's eerie sounding 
plasma wind). And all this with scarcely more computing power  than a 
late '70s video game and a maximum data transfer rate of &nbsp;120 bits/s 
over a distance of more than 600 million Km. In a mission spanning three 
decades, the Galileo space probe has answered many of humanity's 
questions about space and presented us with the knowledge to ask many 
more which will be answered by the next generation of Jovian explorer. 
Goodnight Galileo."

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Sorry, it really wasn't such a hot idea in retrospect to call 
Brad Wilson for Jack's NMR.
Calling Paul Rauterberg should properly get the position back under
control.
I'm calling in my best standby, I'm SURE that Paul will submit orders.
If Jack somehow wants to return, he would have to get orders to
me by the Winter deadline.
Again, I'm sorry for essentially delaying the game like this. 
In retrospect, trying to call Brad didn't work.
My bad.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE):  It's nice to be welcomed with black press.  Not only was the 
"ITALY-BOARD" item not my style (calling it "this humble game" when it 
wasn't mine to call humble), but it was inaccurate (not all players 
offered me welcome despite my writing both the Russian players and most 
others).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EDINBURGH-BERLIN): Good morning!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS): We have been in contact with all our neighbors and all the new heads 
of state. We continue to work with our friends and have extended non-aggression 
talks to Italy. Since we have not heard counter-proposals, we will continue 
to count Italy as hostile and work to remove their forces from our country.
<i>((And guess right at least once.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EDINBURGH-AMSTERDAM): Just want to stay for one more year.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Germany is pressed on many fronts, but still builds.
Thanks everyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to GM): Paul is a very good player, but he's become a pimple on my butt.  Time to
sit on him!  He's still around for awhile though, especially if I keep
goofing up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A RUSSIAN PREDICTION OF THINGS TO COME): German fears not taking Sweden 
so will hold there with support of both fleet Baltic and army Denmark, 
since Denmark can be cut and that leaves two units against the German 
fleet in Sweden.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Germany sweats it out regarding his bad placement that should be used to 
guard Brest, Belgium, and Holland.  That leaves our team two chances in 
three to take one of those centers from Germany.  Not to worry, though, 
since the Veteran's Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, has a sign on one 
door ... SOILED LINENS.  Perhaps Germany would do better if he went into 
yet another room there at that hospital, where the sign says ... Cerebral 
Hygiene ... clear a dirty brain, to you, guy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA): Well, Paul, planks come in various shapes and sizes. 
The one you will be walking looks a lot like Italy! :-)

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Application of all those strange little rules this season.
You cannot cut your own support.
And your support of an attack that would dislodge your own unit doesn't count.
We had both situations in the Balkans this time, didn't we?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MAD COUNT BARNO OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE to DOUBLE PARENTHESES):  I'm 
merely sure that nobody in the E-F-R alliance can eliminate me nor force 
Turkey to eliminate me.  I didn't claim to be certain whether Bruce 
would voluntarily choose to do so, given that it wouldn't help him reach 
18 centers and he's not playing for a few points' difference under any 
scoring system.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(F-T): Negotiations were tempting, but I decided to hold the line with the
alliance and hope nobody else broke. Sorry for the no reply, but the 
longer I delayed a reply the better chance you would not get another to break.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
But you never know, given how extreme the yuppiedom part of the game
has gone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) There are two more "shots" that everyone has.
Next time, Karl Muller moves up to take Austria and everyone else
slides down one country.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY - RUSSIA): No fair, putting thought into your moves!!  
What the hell do you think we're playing?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to WORLD):
DANG!  I should have nuked a way to get Edi to the continent.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to WORLD): See what happens when you do and don't put
thought into your moves??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY - WORLD): I think we should really toss this one to John, RIP.  
Mostly because it would be difficult to get him into first place this 
late in the game, and the rest to tick off Paul, since he leveled me this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to GM):
Is this a record for yuppieness even with this game?       

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ENGLAND): Well, we do have Karl back active in the game again.
But, yes, this is the most yuppieness I've seen.
I'll still probably run another one of these after this one finishes though.
No one ever said I wasn't a glutton for punishment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MORE FROM KARL): Hey, two seasons in a row!  I ain't no Yuppie!
By the way, I Googled the Sch'd'y Wargamers and signed up.  
Oddly enough, since I'm already running about with a roleplaying crowd, 
I think everyone I already know is in it!  
But I'm glad for the link, to expand - through it, I finally found someone in the area who plays Dip!
My wife got a teaching job in Ballston Spa, and she's going to be heading through Sch'd'y proper 
and Scotia each day to get there (at least, that's what she was told was the best way; we'll see).  
Now she wishes we bought in Clifton Park or Malta.  They're never happy...

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm keeping only one list for the new game now up above.
This is scary, the game has gone on for six years now, hasn't it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): Month off....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): The invasion begins!
The Vulcan ship "Intrepid" has been defeated by superior Romulan
forces and is retreating to Andoria, the Vulcans' largest dilithium
crystal producer and the Federation right flank.
If we can form a line at Andoria, the Federation could still survive.
Mr. Spock says our chances are about 3,269,322.04 to 1.
<i>((That last 0.04 is really important, right?
As if I had to ask....)))</i>
Sometimes that Vulcan really gets on my nerves!
I lost my composure and threatened to give him and Mr. Chekov back to
the Romulans.
On the brighter side, we did, with the help of Cardassian neighbors,
obliterate a front line Klingon troop transport with all hands on board.
We, of course, cannot hold the Klingon space station for long, but 
I did enjoy the moment.
PS Still no word from 7 of 9!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY):  The "Germany to Egypt" press last season was black, but it 
expressed things quite accurately.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UNCLE JEFFY POOH to SEAN): Your Harry Andruschak imitation really sucks!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): It's really not all THAT bad....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK to THE EVIL COMMANDER WORF): It is very obvious to me that you do not
really have 7 of 9 in custody.
How do I know this?
Because!
If a "Real Klingon" actually had 7 of 9 in his custody, he would be
more concerned about dressing her down, not up!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT to UKRAINE): .... about that alliance we talked about....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): Wouldn't it be great if the aging Yankee pitching staff faltered
enough that Boston could win the East and Oakland could win the Wild Card?
Could you imagine a $180,000,000 non-playoff team?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): While I ****could*** imagine it in fantasy, Goz is right that far,
it is not going to happen in fact.  Especially now, with Seattle faltering so far.
But it still doesn't matter, the aging starters and lack of middle relief still 
will kill them in the playoffs again this year.
