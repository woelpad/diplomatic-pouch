<div class="p"><!----></div>
HEALTH OF THE DIPLOMACY HOBBY: Stupendous, great!
In just the Judge (automated adjudication) part of the E-Mail hobby alone there
were nearly 2000 (yes, 2000!) completed games in 2003.
My rough guess is that might be about half of the games in total around the
world that were completed last year, something like four or five thousand
games in total.
How can't you think that is great?
Only if you think postal games are essential to hobby health.
I do think that a postal hobby is important, since it generates more of the literary
and personality side of the hobby.
Currently, both the <i>Diplomatic Pouch</i> and <i>Diplomacy World</i> editorships
are in some flux, I hope both will be resolved shortly.
We could do better promoting good literary writing in and about the hobby and
the game, and I most definitely include me in the we.
The personality side of the hobby in the E-Mail world is pulsing up and down.
Included in the ups is the larger and larger groups of people getting together
to play FTF and traveling to FTF games and tournaments.
Buz Eddy and his North American Diplomacy Federation site 
(http://www.diplom.org/NADF/) describes much of the FTF activity in the US, which
is in turn also less than half of the world activity.
The frequency of FTF get-togethers is so large now that we're near having an
event of some kind every weekend of the year.
In the Boston area group that I'm part of alone, there are four events on three
weekends in January coming up and we're averaging well over an event a month.
I personally can't make all of these, but many of them have three boards or more.
The other growing tendency in the worldwide hobby is to generate E-Mail tournaments
of three or four rounds, lasting a year or more, and fielding hundreds of players each.  
There are at least four of these large tournaments going on at the present time,
including the WorldMasters tournament that I publicize here.
All of these things are generating "personality", but I still admit that it is the
case that personality development and comradery in the Hobby grow in fits and starts
through these activities and that those of you who are old fart postal types can still
do your "whinging" (intentionally using the Brit spelling) with some justification.
But volume and people make up for a lot and the trends are all up.
Lots of you, who grew up in the Postal Hobby, are now quite active in various parts
of these hobbies.
Soon after the first of the year, I'm going to start soliciting Hobby Awards nominations
again, and believe me it gets harder and harder to choose every year.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal version of the szine is going to be somewhat delayed, since I've
got to take a weeklong business trip this upcoming week.
But hang on to this one for awhile.
There is a LOT to read in it.
If anyone gets vastly inconvenienced for getting orders in for the January 17th
deadline, I'll just delay your game until February.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still at least one opening, you can start RIGHT NOW to play next year!
Milwaukee won the World Series, something that can NEVER happen in real life.
It isn't like a regular fantasy league, it's completely unique.
We're now bidding on free agents, one
of the most fun times of the year.
They're trying to steal all my players, help!!!
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

Please make careful note of that as well since you generally

This makes TWO missing ex-Boardman Number Custodians that we're

This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.
Check these out if you like:

and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.

There doesn't seem to be much chance of me getting another issue out of

In that case, I will try to house the existing games in other zines and

Maharajiad 1 is the first Tournament for and is designed to showcase the
Maharajah's Diplomacy variant.  The rules and organization of the
Maharajiad are somewhat similar to the Worldmasters Tournament, but
there are several significant differences.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rules and information about the variant can be found at the variant
homepage: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplomiscellany.tripod.com/diplomacy/id4.html, or in
the files section of the maharajahsdiplomacy yahoogroup.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here is a summary of some of the most important Tournament information:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1. To register as a player or GM, or if you wish to help out in some
other way, please contact me at zendip18 of optonline.net, and give your
full name. You may submit a preference list if you wish to enter as a
player.  Registration to the yahoogroup is highly advisable, since that
is where tournament-wide announcements will be made.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2. It is anticipated that board assignments will be completed within one
week after a full roster of GMs and players is set.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3.  The Tournament is individual only, with no team aspect.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4. It is a two round, top-and-advance tournament, with the first round
lasting until 1910, and the second round having no time limit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5.  This is a "full press" Tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6. GMs may adjudicate "by hand", with Realpolitik, or if a judge keeper
permits, by adapting a judge for adjudication, but no player will be
required to submit orders directly to a judge.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7. NMRs will be allowed, and the Tournament will run on a 5 turn basis,
at a pace of approximately 1 game year every two weeks.                         

<div class="p"><!----></div>
8. Each GM will publish results of his or her particular game both in
the maharajahsdiplomacy yahoogroup, and in one of his or her usual
forums, so as to help publicize the variant.

Jim, I need some musical advice. I'm a fan of what I think of as `quirk' 
bands-like Crash Test Dummies ("How come all my body parts so nicely fit 
together?"), They Might Be Giants, Barenaked Ladies. So who else should I 
try out that writes along these lines? (Perhaps a more appropriate way to 
ask would be, who else scribbles just outside of the lines?)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Sigh, Jon Pareles, one of the pop music writers for the New
York Times has been identifying for me the general malaise in the 
music business lately.
I've seen him say this more than once, most recently and
eloquently, I think, in this year's New
York Times yearend review: "I don't think there has to be an
opposition between songwriting and innovation.
Have all the ways to present the song been exhausted?
I don't want a commentary on how all the good ideas have
been used.  I want a new idea."))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((This is a huge problem, as I survey things too.
When you ask me to find you a good idea, I'm not completely stumped,
but I'm challenged.
They Might Be Giants are still doing interesting things, by the way.
But most songwriting these days is so heavily derivative as to 
generate big yawns.  There are two types of ways to go and I will
offer one suggestion in each area - and then more on music as a 
whole down below.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((One idea is to go look at some of the singers who are inventively
reinterpreting some of the great songs that have been written over
the years. 
One of those whom I like is jazzy Diana Krall.
But I'm going to suggest you pick up the new release from Eva
Cassidy, <b>Imagine</b>.
This is a dangerous suggestion because, as I've written here before,
this stunningly original voice is now deceased of cancer.
But she has recorded an amazing array of music, which is why she
could never get any attention or record contracts in life.
On <b>Imagine</b>, in addition to taking on John of course, she
zeroes in on Sandy Denny and does a version of "Who Knows Where
the Time Goes" that just makes you wonder why you ever thought
Sandy Denny was a gorgeous singer.
Eva Cassidy chooses songs and expresses them beautifully, and there's
something to be said for scribbling outside the lines that way as well.
Probably some of it is generated by the knowledge that this songstress
is silenced, but even the hackneyed "Danny Boy" sounds tremendously
fresh in her hands.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((More in line with what you're really talking about, is asking you if
you've paid attention to me talking about Erin McKeown's <b>Grand</b>.
Erin scribbles outside the lines in quirky musical juxtapositions,
but also in lyrics.
"Slung-Lo" is one of the singles that's gotten some alternative
radio play and goes "I was slung-lo and so gung ho for anything
to get me to start; I had my rock, I had my roll, but I couldn't 
find my spark."
This is just such hyperbolic nonsense as Erin has tons of spark.
In the more present type war vein, "Civilians" goes like, "They
are just civilians, we are barely civil to them, and only at times
and we are your citizens burrowing beneath your skin, and crawling
up your spine."
And finally, probably best of all "Vera" has "Oh Vera my cough is silent,
and Sunset is setting up fine; there's work for me here, and here is
my work; while we wait for my lungs to dry."
But if you like <b>Grand</b>, Erin's earlier albums are scribbled even
farther outside the lines.))</i>

Saw Ig Lew's notes about the A's, and frankly I think they're having a 
terrific off-season. Among many other things, Steve "sucky owner" Schott 
turned out to be a brilliant prophet. Last March, he refused to give Tejada 
the 8- to 10-year deal Tejada wanted; on Opening Day, Schott said that he 
still thought the A's would have a chance to sign him this winter, and 
everyone on the planet, including Tejada, laughed... Now look: Tejada had a 
year that depressed his dollar value (he's being told he's a $9-million 
player, not $11M or $12M as most of us thought last winter; he can't get an 
offer longer than 3 years; and he says he's trying to stay in Oakland, 
which offered him arbitration just to keep open the possibility of signing 
him. Damn, could Oakland actually keep an MVP?
<i>((No, since this, of course, he did sign up with Baltimore at those
higher amounts since Mr. Angelos feels the need to "overpay" in order to
buy some improvements for the Orioles.
Though on paper, his signings look good, I don't expect they'll turn out
well, sorry Dicko, but I don't....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Add that to a brilliant move at pitching coach-Curt Young-and the A's are 
already doing better than they had a right to expect.
<i>((I do agree with that and hope they continue to chew up the West!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If my Dodgers get Nomar, and they're smart enough to give second base to 
Joe Thurston full-time, they rise to a mediocre offensive team. When they 
trade away Kevin Brown, it might appear they're losing pitching but what 
they're really losing are DL days; I don't think Brown has another 30 
starts in his arm's career. Right now I think that, swapping Brown for 
Weaver, the Dodgers' pitching will still be more than 90% of what it was 
last season. (Weaver is a jerk personally, but he's a better set-up for 
Gagne than Mota or Quantrill.) That balance-getting a "C" in hitting and 
an "A-" in pitching-would have given them the NL wild card this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I completely agree about Kevin Brown.
I think that trade was more than a little bit nutty.
But George is being George.
And Weaver really could be a damned good pitcher once he gets out of the
NY nuthouse - and it is the fact that he's just such a jerk that made
him unable to put up with New York.
There always are those pitchers that just can't pitch in NY and I could
tell Weaver was one of them when he was with the Tigers.
At least Brown shouldn't have that problem, his ego is just fine, but he's
not such a jerk.
And, of course, they're going to have to find hitting someplace else.
I expect the Giants to continue to beat the pants off the Dodgers,
sorry, but that's the way it's going to go.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks to baseball-reference.com, I know that of all the men to ever play 
major-league baseball, the ones whose careers are most like Nomar's are 
Miguel Tejada and Derek Jeter. I think we are seeing a redefinition of 
shortstop that will change historical baseball stats the way that the DH 
did. (I also know now that Anthony Nomar Garciaparra was born in Whittier 
in 1973, a year in which I helped run my dad's camera store at the east end 
of Whittier Blvd.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As long as I was writing all this, I leafed through the last few <i>TAP</i>s 
again. And my eye fell upon a line in a Mr. Langley summer movie review...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"[Pirates of the Caribbean] is the first movie based on a theme park ride. 
The second is on the way."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, yes, in the narrow meaning of "ride." But there was an earlier movie 
based on a Disney theme park attraction: <i>The Country Bears</i>, which my 
children have made me watch about a dozen times. That's 13 more times than 
the plot deserves; but the songs are good, most of them are sung by John 
Hiatt, and even the Bonnie Raitt/Don Henley duet is listenable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And so I bring this full-circle back to music. Proud of me?

<i>((I'm quite proud of you, and always pleased to get a letter from you!
I always wait too long to talk about end of the year music, so I'm going
to wrap myself back around it again too.
I don't think this is a "complete" list, but here are the special
records that I've been listening to that are new in the last year,
in addition to Eve Cassidy's <b>Imagine</b> and Erin McKeown's <b>Grand</b>.
First, continuing in the discussion of "updating the past", the other
big recent trend has been in doing some really hard work on taking
old analog albums and properly putting them into CD digital formats,
so their sound is alive and clear.
To the good, these efforts have been done well and effectively,
but if you bought the "first versions" of these you are sort of
out of luck.
The latest in this series is the Yes catalog from the 1970's.
And I've really been enjoying the new versions of "Close to the
Edge" and "And You and I"!
After not listening to that music in awhile, it sounds amazingly
fresh and inventive, even though I know every Howe riff and 
Wakeman flourish by heart.
This just cements my difficulties with so much of what I hear
that's new.
I may end up continuing to explore backwards at this rate.
The same thing is happening in the Broadway musical world, where
most of the hot recent musicals are about music ranging from
Abba to big band jaZZ.
The Strokes are one of the hot new bands (and their record 
<b>Room on Fire</b> is that) but they also aggressively look
backward.
Then, you have Jack Black and the School of Rock.
This movie was an amazingly fun time, and the soundtrack is 
a must hit everywhere except that Stevie Nicks song "Edge of 
Seventeen", which is just grating - but hey, Joan Cusack's
turn on Nicks was incredible, so I guess it had to be there.
But, again, that's just more mining of the past, in many 
cases the LONG past.
And the best rock movie in the last year or so is "24 Hour Party
People" going away, but that's about the late 70's punk life
of the developers of the scene that sparked the Happy Mondays
and Joy Division.
The soundtrack is as great as the movie, but it also looks back.
One can't help but think that we're getting ready for some kind
of huge breakout in some new direction when people mine tried
and true and the past so aggressively.
Anyone see the sign of what that will be?
I sure don't.
The only hints I have, and they may just be more "back to the past"
moves, are some of the growing interest in the mandolin and banjo,
and the American roots music that came from that.
T-Bone Burnett has been one of those producing and pushing this
music.
But I don't think that has any chance to be THE way to go.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Given all that, there are some records that I've been listening
to a lot that were produced last year (or close enough to it).
Most of these are new releases from people I've loved for a long
time, they aren't necessarily breaking out in some stunning new
direction, but they are tried and true for me and I love these
records.
Some of them are 2002, I think, but I bought them in 2003.
Well, except for the Mekons' <b>Ooohh</b>, but hey, for my
favorite band with their best album in some time, I'm 
going to make an exception for that.
Los Lobos' <b>Good Morning Aztlan</b> continues their dominance
of the Mexican crossover, and Melissa Ferrick hooks up with
an old favorite bassist, Sara Lee, and makes me listen hard
to <b>Listen Hard</b>.  
And no one feels and sings from the heart better than Lucinda
Williams and <b>World Without Tears</b> - and of course it
really isn't.
Blur stays on top and continues to bury its British rock 
competition with more intense lyrics on <b>Think Tank</b>,
as they pick up some Afro-beat sensibility.
Radiohead is still worth listening to with <b>Hail to the
Thief</b> in the angrier moments as they still ratchet up the
intensity.
And Warren Zevon ends his life with grace and dignity on
<b>The Wind</b>.
All of these records are well worth it.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((What about newer stuff?
Jack White and the White Stripes (sorry, again, Dicko, write me a
letter!!) just don't do it for me.
White is going to be a neat "personality" and he has been called
something like "the best derivative songwriter of his generation"
but his guitar riffs are all derivative of the great metal guitarists,
and he ain't nearly as good as any of them.
And besides, I just don't like metal that much.
I'd like to like the Flaming Lips enough to really recommend them
to y'all, but I can't quite do it.
They have a song called "Thank you, Jack White" that is more
amusing than anything on the White Stripes though....
<b>Fight Test</b> is their latest record, but it is 2002, so it's
a year old now.
They supposedly have another record coming out soon called
<b>Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell</b> and I likely will pick it
up to continue my effort to understand if Wayne Coyne is a genius
or a jerk.
He does keep me buying his records, so that must be something....
As for the other "popular bands", I don't like Outkast or 50 Cent
at all, please murder rap and put it out of its misery, please??
I'm sure I'm missing some of the newer adventurous bands, please
feel free to talk at me about some of them, especially since I
got this out on time, this year!
Oh, yes, one last thing, I meant to mention Fountains of Wayne
and their <b>Welcome Interstate Managers</b>, who aren't really
adventurous, but they scribble in some lines between power pop
and folk that always get me up.
They're a lot of fun, and might be my last suggestion to you,
Pete.
But overall, it still seems to me that young bands really are
just George Bush conservatives at heart, probably the Bush
twins really like them for their party animal froth.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Responding to this comment from Mark's mother Karen:))</i>
"I do follow baseball. Edgar has signed for another year with the 
M's, but we lost Mike Cameron to the Mets. However, we got Raul Ibanez 
back (not sure I'm spelling his name right). I always liked him. We 
also signed Scott Spiezio. I don't recall where he has been most 
recently, but he was an A when I first started going to games in 
Oakland!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spiezio was in Anaheim not too long ago.  I think maybe that was 02, 
when they won.  He wasn't starting every day, but he was a frequent 
substitution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's lost Keith Foulke.  Of the star free agents, he's the one that we 
made a serious offer to keep.  But Boston came up with enough money to 
persuade him to go. (Seems like they've been buying up a lot of our 
guys lately....) Beane's pattern in recent years has been to trade for 
a good but underrated closer, but it looks like that might not happen 
this year.  Probably the A's will do a sort of committee thing with the 
bullpen and maybe convert someone.
<i>((Note Mark builds off this in his next note.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another Beane pattern is to collect a whole messload of medium-good 
relief pitchers during the off-season. Basically, the idea is to pick 
up anyone decent who can be had for cheap, and then let them sort 
themselves out early in the season. Usually one or two are worth 
keeping and the rest get released or traded. That's happening again 
this year.  A's also picked up a decent veteran starter (Redman). Not 
sure what the plan is with him.  At the moment, he's slotted as fourth 
starter, with Harden bumped down to fifth, but I don't know about that. 
(You generally don't like such a young guy in the 5th spot, since he 
won't get regular work.) Makes me wonder if someone is going to get 
traded.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tejada is officially gone now, which the press didn't even pretend was 
a surprise.  He signed with the Orioles, the team that way back in July 
I predicted he'd go to, so I guessed that one right.  Not a real daring 
guess, really.  There are half a dozen teams with a whole lot of money 
to throw around, and there are half a dozen teams where Miguel's talent 
would be a really good fit; Baltimore was the only team that was both.  
Most of the big money teams already have a star shortstop - Texas, 
Yankees, Boston.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I already saw a story about hanging on to Eric Chavez, who will be the 
big free agent after 04. There's one every year. I think Hudson's 
contract runs out after 05.  My guess is that they make him an offer 
early in the season (or pre-season) for moderately big money but not 
superstar money, and with flexibility for the team to trade him if they 
decide to. Then it's up to Eric to decide if he wants to take the safe 
contract or take his chances on having a good enough year to get 
superstar money. That's standard practice for the A's. Some say yes to 
the extension. Giambi and Tejada said no and got a better deal out of 
it. Some say no and don't get a better deal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think the only free agent we actually kept was Rincon, our main LH 
reliever.  I heard a speculation that he'd be converted to closer, but 
I don't think so. The stat where Rincon always scores really well is in 
not allowing inherited runners to score, so that makes him really 
valuable as a guy to bring in in the middle of the inning when the 
previous guy got in a jam.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The team did state clearly that Harden would not be put in the bullpen, 
and presumably neither would Hudson, Mulder or Zito.  I don't know 
enough about Redman to say whether he's a possibility.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I no longer think (as I did for a long time) that Dye might be traded.  
Presumptive outfield is now Kielty-Kotsay-Dye, with Kotsay leading off 
and Dye hitting 3 or 4 with Chavez. Byrnes will be on the team but I 
don't think he'll start. They like him on the bench, because he can 
play all three positions and he subs well as a pinch runner.  He'll get 
some spot starts, though; a lot more than Menechino used to get as the 
backup utility infielder (ie, almost none).

<i>((See paragraph above on Foulke and closers.))</i>
D'oh!  Less than a day after sending this, I heard that the A's were 
getting Arthur Rhodes.  Apparently this was already rumored in the 
news, but I had missed it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I always liked Rhodes, so I'm glad we'll have him. This sort of fits 
the pattern, too, since he's someone who has a history of having been 
good, but seems to be coming off an off year.  I think Foulke and Koch 
were both like that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's got Damian Miller as catcher.  I don't keep track of the NL. I 
think I remember his name from Arizona, but we got him from Chicago.  
Looking back on the old stories, you can see that it was a sort of 
delayed-action three-way deal.  The A's got some other catcher 
(somebody Barrett) from Montreal in exchange for &#228; player to be named 
later", and only a day later sent him on to the Cubs for &#228; player to 
be named later", who now turns out to be Miller.  During the Barrett 
deal, Billy Beane made some cryptic comments which suggest this was the 
plan all along, pending various contingencies that hadn't been worked 
out yet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Redman has been signed, presumably as the 4th starter, which pretty 
much completes the A's team for the year.  A few second-stringers 
remain unsigned (including Chad Bradford), but it sounds like that's 
just salary negotiation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Reading my own A's commentary in TAP.  The sentence about staying an 
A's fan at least as long as Beane is around makes a lot more sense to 
those who know I recently moved from Oakland to Seattle.  I had always 
liked the Mariners OK as a second-favorite team. But the more I get to 
know them, the less I like them. Maybe I'm just spoiled from following 
Beane, and having Sabean next door in SF, but it sure seems like the 
M's management makes a lot of stupid deals - trading good players for 
bad, wasting money, etc.  There was a lot of talk in the local media 
about how bad the former GM was, and now the new guy seems to be just 
as bad.  It makes you wonder if someone higher up isn't pulling some 
strings. I do hear whispers about how such Japanese component in the 
ownership keeps pushing them to pay a lot of money for Japanese stars.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And yet, it seems to work OK. The Mariners do win a lot, after all.  
There are other teams with equally large budgets that do a lot worse.  
I still think the whole division is going to be weaker than last year.  
That's why I still think the A's have the best shot at winning the 
division again, in spite of their own decline.  I think the AL West in 
04 will be what the AL Central has been for the past few years: the one 
where the division championship is easier to achieve than the wild card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You're right about Ramon Hernandez.  As a player, he's no better or 
worse than he always was. The difference is that in the past he was 
underrated and now he's overrated, so trading him was a 
buy-low-sell-high kind of deal.  I've already forgotten the name of the 
new catcher the A's got (I never know NL players, though this guy I had 
at least heard of: Damian something) but I read a story on him and his 
reputation is as a so-so hitter who works well with pitchers and calls 
a smart game. (Also, he blocks the plate well, which is important with 
Hudson, who is notoriously hard to catch.) That suggests that A's 
philosophy on catchers hasn't changed at all, just personnel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think catchers like that is another A's pattern. It's easy enough to 
measure a catcher's hitting stats, and there's also a basic stat that 
gets his defense in terms of throwing people out (ie, what Pudge scores 
well on). What's a lot harder to measure is how well the catcher calls 
the game and helps the pitcher to do better, even though that's a very 
important part of how a catcher contributes to the team. Since it's 
hard to measure, a GM who can judge it well can get a good deal against 
someone else who doesn't. I think a few other teams are on to this 
idea, too.  For all I know, some of them have a complicated SABR that 
tries to quantify it. It also might be one of those things that values 
differently in the AL vs the NL. I don't know the game well enough to 
have a good grasp on the subtle effects of the DH rule, but obviously 
it affects how pitchers are used, so presumably the two leagues require 
slightly different skills from the catcher in managing them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Speaking of SABRs, on one of those wonky baseball blogs I saw an 
interesting analysis of Ted Lilly. Basically, the guy was looking at 
how well Lilly has pitched against opponents of various caliber. In 
short, the conclusion was that Lilly's stats make him look better than 
he is because he can eat up bad teams but he chokes against good teams, 
and that in turn is supposed to be an indicator of a pitcher on the 
decline. If that's true, maybe Beane saw something that Ricciardi 
didn't, and the trade was an old-fashioned "unload the junk on an 
unsuspecting sucker" trades that Beane was once notorious for, as 
opposed to the win-win arbitrage type that he's been doing more 
recently.  Beane and Ricciardi are friends, but that wouldn't stop 
either one from screwing over the other one if he could pull it off - 
just like we game players are happy to viciously stab a friend in the 
back, so long as it's legit and all in the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
21 grams and Russian Ark

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Saw two movies recently that require comment.  Very disparate in
terms of their approach to filmmaking.  In both cases, perhaps the
film's "gimmick" either got in the way, or distracted from the point
of the film.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, "Russian Ark", which is on DVD these days.  It's a 90 minute
movie filmed in one take at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg,
Russia.  (By the South Coast, I believe.)  
<i>((St. Petersburg is where the dot is on the map on the South
Coast...))</i>
The narrator and a French
marquis are walking through the museum, and encountering ghosts of
various periods in Russian history.  They meet Peter the Great,
Catherine the Great, Tsar Nicholas I, Anastasia, etc.  The movie has
a lovely flow to it.  It's apparently focusing on the richness of
Russian history and the relative snobbery of Europeans.  To be
honest, it's hard to figure what the film is <i>about</i>, but it's
enjoyable to watch for the costumes, music, and technical
achievements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
21 Grams is a Must-See.  Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, and Naomi Watts
are all at the top of their games.  This movie is about three people
tied together by a car accident where BdT runs over NW's husband and
two daughters.  When her husband sinks into a vegetative state, NW
agrees to organ donation, which gives a new heart to SP, a
mathematician (yay!) who has been battling heart disease.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's about enough of the plot to summarize - it's covered in most
of the reviews and doesn't give much away.  The trick of this movie
is the jumbling of the chronological order of the scenes.  The scenes
are jumping back and forth from flashback to flash-forward, and all
over the place.  There is a general direction to the movie - most of
the early scenes in the movie world are shown early in the film, and
the later scenes in the the movie world are shown towards the end of
the film.  But there's a lot of jumbling.  It's really quite fun to
try to keep pace with what's happening.  I don't <i>think</i> there are
any major plot discontinuities of the sort that brought Memento down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some reviewers wonder if the film material was strong enough to not
require the kind of temporal tricks that the director, 
Alejandro Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu, uses.  I think the movie could have
stood alone fairly well with a simple order to the scenes, without
the time gimmickry.  But I don't know if that's the point.  It's sort
of like going to the art museum and saying "nice painting, but
couldn't Monet have made this a bit less blurry?"  The constant time
shifting has the effect of taking the events out of time completely. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm on the cusp of a real clever observation, but I'm not smart
enough to figure out what it is.  :(

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, if you haven't seen the film, you should.  It's Naomi Watts'
finest performance to date.  Finally, while leaving the cinema it
occurred to me that there was a pattern in her films.  Namely:
characters romantically involved with her characters tend to meet
with grisly ends.  The dark-haired mystery woman in "Mulholland
Drive", the ex-husband in "The Ring", the husband in "21 grams", and
even the French husband in "Le Divorce" (bit of a spoiler there, but
I think that movie could stand spoiling).  Something to think about.

<i>((You clearly haven't seen "The OUtsider".... she gets shot
in that... I won't say more to avoid spoiling that one, which is
marginally worth seeing.... well, it's better than "Le Divorce".
And it DOES break the pattern.
I also was shown there that I've got only two or three Degrees of
Separation from Naomi Watts, and you only have three or four.
Tim Daly is Naomi's co-star and I've met Tim Daly a couple of times,
my wife has met him a bit more and good friends of mine are friends 
of his.  Tim Daly used to live here in Providence.
I will see both of these, but haven't yet as of this point.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Let me take this point to make some general comments about movies
in 2003, not having seen yet all of the end of the year movies.
Once I sat back and thought about it in the past few weeks, this
has been an amazingly good year for moviemaking.
Amazing not because the movies have been amazingly good, but amazing
since in August I would have told you that this was THE worst year
for moviemaking ever!!
For the first half of the year, the only decent movie released (and
which thus will probably be overlooked unfairly in the Oscars and 
other awards) was the "Life of David Gale" (or was that an end of 2002
movie?  Can't recall, but I saw it in 2003).
And even there, the movie starts very poorly as Kate Winslet is gorgeous
and I love her, but she has trouble getting into her part, and
Kevin Spacey does some scene stealing, but the person who DESERVES
a Best Supporting Actress nod for the year is Laura Linney.
I have NOT been a huge Linney fan in the past, but for nothing else
she should get at least a nomination for the range she displayed
from "Life of David Gale" to "Mystic River" to "Love Actually".
If you haven't seen Gale yet, go rent it, but you don't want to know
too much more than what I just told you, since I can't tell you how
brilliant Linney was without MAJOR spoilers.
Just keep your eye on her.
And in "Mystic River" she has some of the same level of seriousness,
but that is another movie best seen knowing as little as possible 
about it.
But she is every bit the equal and more of Sean Penn, who seems to get
all the buzz for acting in the movie.
In "Love Actually" she is giddy and in love, actually!
I probably shouldn't admit it, but I loved that movie and the only
part I thought was over the top was the part where Hugh Grant was
going door to door looking for his love, as the Prime Minister with
only ONE security guard.
Really.... but it did lead to some funny bits.
Linney and Keira Knightley both played their love parts with sensitivity
and depth.
One of the other good movies in the first half of the year (but I didn't
see it until just recently) starred Knightley, and that was of course
"Pirates of the Caribbean", which was preposterously funny too.
Knightley is going to find herself a great career very quickly. 
The only other movie in the early part of the year that I can remember
that was worth anything was "A Mighty Wind".
This is the latest Christopher Guest movie, and I talked about Catherine
O'Hara in an issue earlier this year.
I think this is the best movie in this series, though "Best in Show"
has more pure hilarity.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((But the prevailing feeling in the first half of the year to me was
expressed by Ang Lee's excesses in "The Hulk".  That movie was amazingly
bad.  
But then, the movie I recall that turned the trend around was "Matchstick
Men".  I usually see twists like this coming, at least to some degree, 
but somehow I was totally floored by this one.
Nicolas Cage led a great ensemble task and all of those ticks and things
that Cage did were amazing.
Then came the fall, and it seemed like good movies were opening every week,
led by "Master and Commander" and "Mystic River".
I even liked "Elf" and "Love Actually" on the more fluffy side.
Then you came to December's overload, which I still haven't caught up on.
Tom Cruise's "The Last Samurai" didn't get especially good reviews, but
I really enjoyed it.
The consistency and seriousness of the path that Cruise's character took
was much stronger than I expected. 
I am a huge Toshiro Mifune fan, so the samurai behavior codes and character
was well known to me and WAS the point of the movie, NOT the action.
Though it had more than its share of violence, the characters all were
drawn carefully.
I still haven't seen "Lord of the Rings" since Charlotte and I wanted
to review the other two films again first and hadn't had the time to do it.
I also expect there are three or four other films at the end of the year
like "21 Grams", "Cold Mountain" and "In America" that will impress
me a lot.
On the fun side RI native Farrelly brothers continue to make sweet and
deep comedies with "Stuck On You", be sure you stay for ALL the 
credits.
"Calendar Girls" was more fun than I expected and even "Paycheck"
had some more ummph than reviews led me to expect.
Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman had a lot of chemistry.
Now we have our news on this issue from Steve, and a positive
other side to his announcement.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sorry about that...  Not a movie review...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It doesn't look like I will be doing movie reviews any time soon.  I 
retired the beginning of this month and have not felt the need for a 
movie since.  I used to go see movies as a way to combine comfort food 
(popcorn) with a way to remove myself from myself.  It was a means of 
relaxation that relieved a lot of the week's tensions. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since retiring, I sleep when I feel like it, eat when I feel like it, 
talk to the cat when she feels like a conversation, and little at all 
that causes tension.  I used to be up to three acid reduction pills a 
day.  Doctor directed mind you.  I'm now taking a pill when I feel a bit 
acidy.  Once every day or so.  I may stop using them all together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, I don't seem to be interested in going to the movies any more.  
Sorry about that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you would be interested in hearing short anecdotes about my cat, or 
any other thing that strikes me as interesting, respond to this and I'll 
put you on a new mailing list.  The retired guy's ramblings mailing list.

Not a movie review, revisited...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first time I did this my mailing profile used my legal name, 
Fredric.  It only much later came to my attention that this was the 
case.  I don't see what name the mail I send goes out under.  After a 
couple of you asked about my name change I finally figured it out.  
There was no name change, just a change of ISP and the confusion that 
seems to cluster around having more than a single name to work with.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, if you tossed the first e-mail because you didn't know the 
sender, you missed the part where I told you that I don't go to movies 
anymore, and so there will no more reviews.  That isn't actually totally 
true.  The occasional movie that really needs a big screen will still 
pull me in.  I just will not be going to see as many movies as I used to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The part about no more reviews is pretty solid though.  What I have 
decided to do instead, just because I like to write about things that I 
see and think, is to send out a irregular e-mail message which I have 
decided to call `Retired Ramblings'.  I have started a new mailing list 
and will add your name to it only if you want me to do so.  I see no 
reason why you should have to see ramblings if all you are interested in 
is movies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect that I will be writing some about teaching kid's to be better 
readers, some about my cat, some about politics, and some about all the 
rest of the things that go on in the world around me.  Let me know if 
you want to see it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have had a couple of comments about my being retired and wanting to 
hear about being retired. Being retired is good. One of the things I 
wanted to do was determine my actual sleep cycle. I suspected that it 
was going to be up all night and sleep during the early day. Much to my 
surprise I discovered that I am not on a 24 hour cycle. I seem to stay 
awake for 16 to 17 hours and then sleep for 4 to 5 hours. My sleep times 
are daytime, nighttime, whatever. About all I make an effort to do is 
watch two or three hours of television in the evening. That, and go to 
school once a week.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In case you are out of that loop, I am a volunteer at my local school. I 
mentor six fourth grade students to try to get them to develop better 
reading strategies. I'll go into more detail after a few weeks, when I 
have a better feel for what it is that I really do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most of my time has been spent surfing the net. Speaking on which...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Republican National Committee has brought out a new game called 
`Democratic Debate Bingo'. Essentially it is the old `Buzz-Word Bingo' 
game using some of the Democrats favorite phrases. The proposed game is 
to make the `protests, pessimism, and personal attacks' featured in the 
Democratic Parties debates a little more entertaining for the people 
watching the debates. Clever idea, indirectly undermining any serious 
position the opposition might take by poking fun at it through the game. 
No Republican can be quoted as harassing the Dems, but the job gets done 
anyway. Of course the assumption is that people are watching the debates 
for entertainment. I'm not sure that is the case.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can find out more about the game by going to the Republican National 
Committee web-site.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Committee has a three plank position. Republicans say they are for a 
strong economy, protecting the environment, and national defense. I'm 
for all of those. So why am I not a Republican? I think it's because I 
think Republicans use too much double-speak. `Strong Economy' seems to 
mean less regulation and public oversight of corporations. `Protecting 
the Environment' seems to mean weakening the laws that protect the 
environment in favor of big business, and National Defense seems to mean 
putting American kids in harm's way with little real justification.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have a specific `protecting the environment' example. Existing 
emissions laws for mercury have set a cap of 5 tons annually by 2007. 
The EPA has a new plan to cap mercury emissions to 34 tons annually by 
2010, and then to reduce that to 15 tons annually by 2018. Mercury 
causes birth defects and child death. But as the Republican spokesperson 
for the EPA has pointed out, capping the emissions with the existing law 
would create a hardship for the power industry. Any power system that 
burns fossil fuel emits Mercury. Power industry vs kids. Guess which 
group makes larger political contributions. I guess I'm glad I live in 
the Pacific Northwest. Mercury stays pretty close to where it is emitted 
and we do not burn fossil fuel for power all that much up here. I feel a 
little guilty about being glad though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
According to our president, the economy is getting better. Is that your 
personal observation? Does the economy seem healthy to you? We have lots 
of people out of work, and more being laid off all the time. The 
government says production is up and maybe it is, but is the economy up? 
You know, when Saddam was captured the expectation was that the stock 
market would take a big jump. Instead it took a loss. The same day, the 
dollar took a loss. To me, those are indications that the economy is not 
really very healthy. Good news is supposed to lift the economy, and if 
the economy were healthy, I think it would have.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One thing is for sure. If through some miracle we were able to bring our 
kids home from Iraq there would be no jobs for them here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Side by side as it were, there is an outfit called Rep America which 
touts itself as representing the very best of the Republican Party. It 
makes it immediately clear that it is not associated with the Republican 
National Committee. It also takes a strong pro environmental position 
towards the development of alternative power sources, curtailing 
development in national lands, doing something more than study about 
global warming, developing a better energy policy. All good things. 
These are good people. I wish them well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course, the Republican National Committee is right about one thing. 
If you visit the Democratic National Committee website all you will find 
is stuff about stopping the Republicans attempts to destroy jobs, the 
environment, and so forth. The Democrats seem to be so busy trying to 
keep the Republicans from passing bills that they don't actually have a 
plan of their own for the country. That doesn't make me feel all that 
comfortable with being a Democrat, either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What they do have are Presidential Candidate Bios, and links to their 
web-sites. I'm guessing there is only going to be one Republican 
candidate, so, no bios and no links there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll write more about this, I'm sure.

Now this is not meant to be a joke. My mouse squeaks. It is a brand new 
mouse. When I move it, it squeaks. The sound reminds me more of a 
squeaky door than anything else. It is not very loud but when I am 
concentrating on something and hear the squeak, it is very distracting. 
Just wanted to let you know that being retired has its problems, too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Indeed, the earth shakes....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There were two news stories that excited me today. The first was about 
two medical breakthroughs that get around the limitations on the stem 
cell research that were set a couple of years ago. Using cloning 
techniques human embryo tissue is being developed to the point where 
stem cells can be harvested, and similarly, infertile eggs are being 
pushed to the point where stem cells can be harvested. The ethical 
considerations about human life being traded for stem cells doesn't 
really apply. The cloning is not to create life, just tissue, and the 
eggs, while human, are infertile and so have no potential for life. The 
stem cells may possibly be used to develop cures for almost any organ 
degenerative disease.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The second story had to do with a test flight. A private company is 
developing a spaceship. They did a test flight on the 100th anniversary 
of the Wright Brother's Kitty Hawk flight. The guy who designed the 
spaceship is the same guy who designed Voyager, the plane that flew 
non-stop around the world. The spaceship is rocket propelled and is 
still in the prototype stages, but it did fly. The plan is to make 
private spaceships available to anyone who wants to own his or her own 
spaceship. The first flight fell well short of orbiting, but still...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, on to politics again...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been visiting a lot of political sites from both parties. I have 
been reading op-ed pieces, and listening to NPR, CNN, and Fox. I have 
then a wide spectrum of input. What I gather from this is that we may 
very well have four more years of Republican rule in this country. 
Howard Dean looks like the most likely Democratic contender. I gather 
this from the large number of people not in his campaign making op-ed 
suggestions as to what he needs to do. There do not seem to be 
suggestions for any of the other Dems, just Dean.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then too, his is the name on most of the Republican lips. Of course they 
seem to want him to run, which might help sink him. Either way works for 
them actually. Dean seems to be the best contender the Dems have. If the 
Republicans get their publically preferred way he runs, if not, someone 
even weaker runs. Win win as they say.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, Dean. So far as I can tell, he is a New England almost Liberal 
governor who is very against the war in Iraq. Not all wars, but 
certainly that one. I find I have a lot of positions in common with him. 
I figure, based on that, that his chances for election are pretty nil. 
His biggest problem seems to be that the south doesn't ever vote for New 
England almost Liberals. Considering that Bush is a southern 
conservative of a most compassionate nature he looks solid in the south. 
That is a huge head start for the Republicans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But then, maybe Dean will charm his way into southern hearts. That's 
what it will take. People no longer vote for the better man, they vote 
for the one that is more charming. You just have to hope that the man 
that gets elected has more going for him than charm. Speaking of which, 
wasn't that a cool deal for Bush to spend Thanksgiving with the troops? 
That may be the best thing he has done as our president.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It would be nice if he were to apply himself to getting the kids back 
home to where they belong. Yeah, that would be even cooler.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, Dean's stated national security positions are:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Strengthen our military and intelligence capabilities so we are best 
prepared to defend America and our interests.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rebuild our global alliances and partnerships, so critical to our nation 
and so badly damaged by the present administration.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bring to bear these resources and alliances on our nation's most 
critical and urgent national security priority: defeating the terrorists 
who have attacked America, continue to attack our friends, and are 
working to acquire the most dangerous weapons to attack us again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please note, there is nothing there about making war on other countries. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not clear what can really be done to defeat terrorists. The current 
technique of arresting Muslims may even work. It sounds like a really 
offensively bad idea, but it may work. If you accept that most of the 
terrorists are Muslims then if you lock up all the Muslims you lock up 
most of the terrorists.  Too bad for all of the decent law abiding 
citizens who just happen to belong to the wrong religion. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One suggestion I've heard discussed, make friends in the Arab world, 
doesn't really take into account the realities that we control most of 
the wealth of the world. Unless we can somehow lift the rest of the 
world to our level of affluence, we are not going to make friends. Until 
we can resolve the Israeli/Arab conflict we are not going to make 
friends. I'm thinking the former is less of a challenge than the latter.

<i>((One thing that you have to remember about the voting dynamics
is that Dean has somewhere between 1-2 million supporters who generally
do NOT vote in elections.
Eventually, I'm convinced that the "Max Headroom" world of politics
will come forth where the Internet will really be where politics are
conducted.
One could even argue that the progress on this front has been very slow.
For this election, it is uncertain whether this 1-2 million voter
block (a) actually comes out to vote for Dean, (b) can be transferred to
any other Dem if Dean isn't nominated (answer almost surely no), (c)
whether this matters at the margin (given the close vote three years 
ago, the answer should be yes).))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((To me, one has to weigh risks and properly value the loss of freedom
that accrues to society from trying to lock up anyone who "might be
a terrorist".  
I'm pretty sure where that equation balances out in the sense that it
is to the "left" of the current administration.
It would be a good idea to me if Dean and others stated how far they
would move that detention equation.
The question I always ask people is: "do you walk out the door in
the morning and drive your car?" 
Then if you do, you are showing a capability of managing a lot more
risk than Ashcroft rhetoric would suggest.
On the other hand, a capability does not equal a reality.
I recognize very well that in fact few people recognize how much
danger they put themselves in every day in cars and how they 
drastically overrate their susceptibility to terrorists.
As I've said here before, I was much more worried about my
safety from terrorist attack BEFORE Sept. 11 than I have been
at any time since.))</i>

I watched two news conferences and noted some interesting ineptitude.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rumsfeld, our Secretary of Defense was interviewed following the capture 
of Saddam Hussein in which he stated that Saddam would be treated under 
the Accords of the Geneva Convention. This at the same time Saddam's 
picture was being sent to every newspaper on the planet. Personally I 
think that the man who is filling the role of Secretary of Defense ought 
to at least be familiar with the Accords, or keep his mouth shut about 
them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Ah, but that wasn't the Dept. of Defense that was faxing/transmitting
all those pictures around, these were just "embedded journalists"......
just kidding, you're right of course.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cheney, our Vice-President was asked about the Haliburton overcharge 
that was recently uncovered. Cheney said that Haliburton had apologized. 
He went on to say that there was no proof that their was anything wrong 
in the way the contract had been given to Haliburton. Since when does a 
criminal act get corrected through apology? And, especially interesting, 
why would he say there was no proof rather than no impropriety?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Perception is reality.
If people perceive this is sufficient then it is politically sufficient.
And be assured Vice President Cheney understands that completely.
I hope he wouldn't be angry at those of us who subject this situation
to more logic, but one cannot be sure of that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Maybe in the world of today it is about what can be proved rather than 
what is ethical. I hope not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((What is proof?
Again, though, I'm being rhetorical.
But not completely so, that's part of the problem.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wrote the following quite a bit earlier, meaning to send it before 
now....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been spending a lot of time surfing the net. Back when I was 
first resisting getting an ISP my reasons were simple. I am somewhat 
compulsive. Well, maybe more than somewhat. My fear was that if I got 
into net surfing I might not come back out. So, despite getting an ISP 
several years ago I did not really use the net for more than e-mail and 
some shopping. No chat rooms, no news groups, no online gaming (with one 
externally influenced exception), no finding cool sites and linking to 
others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, I have more time now, and guess what. I was right. For the first 
two weeks or so of retirement, I spent all of my time exploring the net. 
I have touched upon chat rooms. I have not yet figured out news groups. 
I have discovered Blogs. I have been visiting various political sites, 
both parties. I have clicked on lots of links.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I doubt I will ever get into chat rooms. I don't type fast enough. I 
found it difficult to even follow conversations. But then, I wasn't in a 
chat room that actually interested me. I went to a retired persons chat 
room. Strangely enough it seemed to mostly be about sex. You know, I 
have long wondered what was the point of sex on-line. Chatting about it 
with a group of over 60's bewilders me even more. I tried to get into a 
gamer's chat, but all the ones I found were password protected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Blogs now. Some are fascinating. Some are a waste of time for both 
reader and writer. There are way too many to read. I couldn't possibly 
even keep up with the updates. I may find a few that I will want to keep 
up with though. Dave Barry doesn't really amuse me all that much, but 
the guy who wrote the latest insert into the Dave Barry Blog was really 
funny.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Despite the movie moratorium I went to the Lord of the Rings Flic. That 
was a 3.5 hour movie that really went by fast. I am amazed at how really 
great the sets, the animation, the whole thing really was. Funny aside, 
I have not taken an acid blocker for nearly a week. Today, the first day 
that I had scheduled like a work week, I woke up needing a blocker, and 
about 10 hours later I needed one again. Maybe the going to the movies 
reminded my stomach to pump out extra acid.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even yet another reason not go to the movies. Although I have to admit 
there were some seriously tempting trailers that came with LOTR. I will 
go to the Harry Potter flic at least.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Quite a few years ago when I was living in Alaska in an apartment 
without television, I spent even more time than usual reading. I was 
there on a contract and since the idea of a social life is a somewhat 
alien concept to me, I spent all of my off hours in the apartment. Okay, 
I spent some in movie theaters, and some in the bookstore at the mall, 
but mostly I read.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the book store I came across some really fat fantasy books by Robert 
Jordan. I think there were two or three in a series called 'The Wheel of 
Time'. The clerk at the bookstore was a Jordan fan. He told me that he 
had heard that the series was supposed to go for ten books. We both 
marveled. The very concept of writing that many words is somewhat 
daunting to me. Then I read the first of the books and became a Robert 
Jordan fan, too. Great characters, intricate plot, complex universe, 
lots of detail, just the sort of book I prefer. I just now read the 
tenth in the series. I was about half way into it and I started to 
wonder how he was going to manage to complete the series in the four 
hundred or so pages left. I did say they were fat books, didn't I? Well, 
I am very pleased to say that he didn't manage to wind thing up. There 
is more to come, and, according to the blurb on the back cover, a 
prequel has just been published.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you have a lot of time to read fantasy fiction, and want a really 
complex fantasy to read, you could do a lot worse than Robert Jordan and 
`The Wheel of Time'.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'd generally agree, I am NOT a fiction reader, 
but we do own the whole Jordan series and I've read part of it - I 
don't spend enough time reading fiction to get that far, 
so it's probably another ten years of
reading for me - Charlotte is more like Steve and she's gone through
the whole thing.
We both find the stupendous length of the whole set of ten books -
the tenth is JUST out in paperback - to be somewhat repetitive
and tedious at times.
But I can put books down easily, while Charlotte tends to doggedly
stick with them to the end.
Oh, yes, and like much of fantasy, there is a lot of blood and guts
and violence, slightly more than I prefer, I find that I like the
softer style of Harry Potter, for example.
But it is fiction that I read, and that's a lot to say for me.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have a lot of such time just now, so I went to my bookcase to retrieve 
the first nine books. I only found eight of them. The eighth volume, 
which I have already purchased twice, is missing. I bought it twice 
because I was looking for a good book to read on a visit to Sacramento, 
and when I saw it the second time it had been so long since I bought a 
Jordan book that I thought it must be new. I figured it out fairly 
quickly when I started reading the story and recognizing events. So, I 
then had two copies. Somehow I have managed to misplace both of them. 
Typical.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course there is always the chance I'll find one of them by the time 
I've re-read the first seven books. If not, I can buy it for the third 
time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The books are even better on the re-read. The first time through, some 
of the names meant nothing to me. The story moved so fast that I lost 
track of them by the time I ran into them again in later books. This 
time, I recognize them upon first meeting. I don't remember all the 
details of who they are but I do recognize them, and can only marvel 
again at how complex a story Jordan wove, even from the beginning.

Retired Ramblings #7 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Merry Christmas...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was asked about nanotech. I did some research. But first...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nanotechnology started in 1959 when Richard Feinman presented a paper 
"There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom" to the American Physical 
Society (published February of 1960) suggesting that the next big 
(albeit very small) frontier in physics was analogous to writing the 
Encyclopedia Britannica on the head of a pin. Feinman suggested ways that 
such a feat could be accomplished, and suggested further that pursuing 
the problem would bring the same sort of academic precedence as had 
fallen to the people who pioneered low temperature, high pressure, and 
high vacuum physics.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some forty plus years later the field is wide open and being actively 
pursued. There are sub-fields of nanoelectronics, nanocybernetics, 
nanochemistry, nanobiology, and probably a few others that are not being 
openly talked about.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tools of the nanoscientists include the Scanning Tunneling Electron 
Microscope (STM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The STM focuses a 
beam of electrons that can be used to manipulate atoms. In its earlier 
incarnation the STM was used as an observational tool for looking at 
molecular structure. It was powerfully useful in mapping the human 
genome, for instance. However in nanotechnology rather than just being a 
tool for observation, it is a tool for manipulating nanotech atomic 
building blocks. Of course it is a ponderously huge machine compared to 
the things it is working on, and so it moves very slowly and builds very 
slowly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The AFM brings a scanning head very close (just over 10 angstroms) to 
the material being observed and measures the atomic forces binding the 
material together as it scans. It is an observational tool. However, it 
should be noted that while the atomic forces of the material are 
affecting the AFM, the atomic forces that hold the AFM scanning head 
together are affecting the material. Heisenberg will not be cheated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The kind of successes that are being felt today include: nanowires, 
molecular wires that have been demonstrated to conduct electric charges; 
molecular electronic circuit arrays; quantum dots, nanometer devices 
that have wireless on-off qualities; quantum corrals, structures of 
atoms on a surface that can surround and hold an electrical charge; 
nanofabrication through `printing' of nanostructures using 
self-assembling molecular monolayers; manipulation at room temperature 
of individual molecules using the STM; experiments with arrays of 
micro-STM and micro-AFM devices.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The kinds of problems that are being faced include: building a 
nanorectifier or transistor; fabricating nanodevices from nanoparts; 
manufacture of nanoscale silicon structures to contain nanodevices;
<i>((Once you design these nanoscale silicon structures, you also
will have an engineering problem to fix or bond the nanodevices to
the silicon structures, though the summary statement that Steve
is drawing from might just account for this in the thinking.
Silicon is of course required because it is the "best" inert substance
that doesn't conduct electricity and interfere with the structures
you're attaching to them.  
It also makes it kinda difficult to attach things to it, so I can't
imagine that is a trivial part of the problem.))</i> 
actually building devices to use the quantum dots mentioned above; 
developing interconnects with the theoretically possible terabit (that's 
a 1 with 12 zeros) memory chips; parallel manufacture of nanodevices 
using arrays of the micro-STM and micro-AFM devices mentioned above; 
development of `virtual' controls to allow computer simulated 
nanodevices to be constructed through feeding the simulation directly to 
the nanoconstruction controls.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The above discussion was limited to nanoelectronics, which is one of the 
nanofields where the most advancement has been made. The other is 
nanobiology, which I'll get to in a minute. Nanocybernetics depends upon 
nanoelectronics. In fact most of the nanoelectronic development being 
done is being done in suppport of future nanocybernetics. However there 
is no theoretical reason why there could not be nanodevices that are 
more like small machines than like small computers. Imagine if you will 
small robots in a small factory turning out very small nanotech devices. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may be asking yourself, what is the point of nanocybernetics, other 
than to support nanocybernetics construction. The smaller the distances 
traveled in a computation, the faster the computation. Nanocomputers 
will be capable of billions times as many computations per second as 
their macro versions. They will have megaterabyte storage, allowing them 
to contain for example all of the movies ever filmed in a size smaller 
than a dust mote. Tiny devices won't have the heat generating problems 
their larger relatives suffer either. No need for heat sinks and cooling 
fans. The amounts of energy required to run a nanocomputer are nearly 
too small to measure. Small size and incredible capacity make them worth 
developing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nanochemistry is the study of the possibilities in building molecules 
one atom at a time. Materials that are first synthesized in computer 
models can then be constructed using nanochemical techniques to build 
incredibly long monomolecular threads with enough strength to hold their 
own weight when hung from a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Cables 
formed from twisting such threads together would open up the possibility 
of riding a cable car to near space.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feinman suggested some of these ideas back when he invented the whole 
concept. What he did not mention, except in passing, is nanobiology..

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most of nanobiology today is the observation at the nano level of 
existing biological structures. Viruses are looked at down to their 
molecular structure and chemical interaction. Bacteria are observed 
along with their reaction to various conditions, including drugs and 
auto-immune antibodies. STMs are being used to modify viruses and 
bacteria to create alternate forms that can theoretically be used to 
attack disease vectors, or just clean up the environment. At the same 
time, nanocapsules are being developed to deliver measured amounts of 
drugs with astounding precision.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of the lines of investigation is developing nanodevices to correct 
DNA breakdown. Our bodies replicate themselves on a regular basis, 
replacing old cells with new cells. Our DNA controls that replication. 
However, as time passes, the DNA matrix develops small flaws. Pieces 
that should connect come apart. There is enough redundancy built into 
the system that it takes a lot of deterioration before cells stop being 
replicated properly. But, it does happen. We all age as our DNA 
deteriorates. The plan is to develop nanodevices which will be able to 
go into our bodies and correct the DNA breaks by rebuilding the 
disconnects. If this can be developed, there is no reason why a human 
being could not remain youthful and healthy for thousands of years. Of 
course we had better do some serious space development between now and 
then or there just will not be room for all of us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It has been suggested that nanotechnology will be the next really big 
developing science. I see no reason to believe otherwise. There are 
amazing things that have already been done, and there are amazing 
breakthroughs right on the horizon.

Retired Ramblings #8 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was just listening to NPR which was giving a list of `Science' unusual
things. The announcer was most impressed by the news about `dark matter' 
and `dark energy'. Most of the universe is made up of stuff that we 
can't see. We have only lately begun to infer its existence. The 'dark 
side' of the universe is estimated to be 96% of the whole. That is, we 
can see and measure a guessed 4% and the rest of it is still a mystery. 
For me, the fact that we can put a number on it (I hesitate to guess how 
close a number) means that we are well along the way to measuring it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The item I was most impressed with was the story about some college kids 
who tied 100 Apple Macs together and built the world's third most 
powerful computer. They did it at less than 100th the cost of the big 
machines. Never underestimate the power of a young mind. Kids who don't 
know the way it has always been done can do some pretty amazing things.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One followup item. Last week I mentioned the EPA's plans to change the 
legal Mercury level upwards. The same government that is raising the 
limit on how much Mercury pollution will be allowed has just released a 
warning to pregnant women telling them to stop eating fish. The fish in 
our oceans have Mercury levels that are higher than is healthy for a 
fetus. I guess the government decided to make it the citizen's 
responsibility to keep from being contaminated. I'm just as happy that I 
don't care for fish all that much. Mercury is deadly to fetuses and 
infants. It is just harmful to older children and adults.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((It would be interesting if the government applied the same attitude
toward environmental risk that they adopt toward terrorist risk....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You remember hearing that fish is brain food? I heard it a lot when I 
was growing up. The irony is that Mercury poisoning kills brain cells. 
What it comes down to is that there is lots of poison out there and it 
is up to you to be aware of it and avoid it, because the government 
which is supposed to be protecting you is too busy protecting its 
political contributors instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The dangers of nanotechnology have been expressed as `grey goo'. Website 
(courtesy of Brad Blair) 
http://www.quinion.com/words/turnsofphrase/tp-gre3.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The basic idea is that nanobots will be self replicating, and will end 
up eating the world and reducing it to nothing more than a grey goo of 
nanobots.  Scary scenario.  But self replicating?  Give me a break. Who is 
going to sell you a self replicating nanobot when they can sell you 
non-self replicating nanobots over and over again for the rest of your 
very long life. Self replication causes bad cash flow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Note the direct similarity to your note about about the kids
linking the Apple computers together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Apple expressly did NOT build a self replicating or self-supercomputer 
creating capability into their computers, and neither does anyone else.
It's basically the same idea and nanobots will have the same "limitations"
as they develop as mainframe computers had and PC's have now.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other scenario is that a nanobot assembler runs amok and eats the 
world while building a huge supply of grey goo. That's slightly more 
likely. Someone might very well design in a self repair function to a 
nanobot assembler as being a cost effective move thus allowing it the 
capability of running forever. But he would also have to build in the 
raw material fetching mechanism to allow the assembler to eat the world. 
Going out and getting its own raw material isn't especially cost 
effective and way too hard to direct. After all, you would not want to 
be sued for eating other people's raw materials. So while a nanobot 
assembler might lose its off switch, I don't think it will be able to 
run much past the point where the raw materials stop flowing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Behind the fear is the underlying assumption that machines are alive. I 
knew people in the 60's (who worked in the computer field) who were 
seriously afraid that computers were going to become self aware. A whole 
series of `Terminator' movies were based on the idea. The same 
underlying fear, that nanobots will start directing themselves is what 
we really have here. I personally do not believe that we are smart 
enough to build self awareness into a machine. I'm pretty sure that it 
is a way too complicated function to be arrived at accidently through 
self programming.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Self programming is something that we have developed. That doesn't mean 
that the self programmer will start inventing new code. What it means is 
that we can talk to the program at a meta level, where we do not have to 
be quite as precise as we do when we talk to it in its own language, 
and it will develop code that meets our meta level requests. This is an 
iterative process. Much the way users and programmers work today. We ask 
the machine to solve a problem. It takes a cut at it. We look at the 
result, and ask it to refine parts. The machine is doing the actual 
programming. But it is limited to doing the sort of programming that we 
have told it how to do. And, as I indicated above, we are not smart 
enough to tell it how to be self aware.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Routers are self programming. Routers are the interconnects in the 
cybernetworks that decide which messages get priority when two or more 
arrive at the same time. Essentially they decide that the messages that 
arrive more often are the ones that should get priority. Routers keep 
track of message packet headers and change priorities based on the 
number of messages encountered. Several months ago there was a virus 
that flooded the net with bogus messages. It brought the net to its 
knees, slowing it to a near standstill because there were so many bogus 
packets moving that the real packets were being blocked. The routers 
were busy reprogramming themselves to give the bogus messages top 
priority. Even after the virus was destroyed, and the bogus packets 
stopped moving, many routers were still inefficient, because the real 
flow priorities had all been rewritten.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Routers also decide where to send the packets (there are always 
alternate routes to consider) based on traffic weight. That too is 
constantly being updated and changes as the traffic flow changes. That's 
self programming in action. Any chance a router is going to suddenly 
become self aware?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nano computers have the potential to be much more computationally 
powerful than any computer we have today (even more than 100 Macs tied 
together) but computational power is not the same as self aware 
intelligence. Maybe some day we will be smart enough. I'm guessing that 
if we get that smart, we will be smart enough to deal with any problems 
that might arise, too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our Homeland Security competence is being challenged. Just before 
Christmas we published a `terrorist watch list' and gave it to France. 
The French shut down flights from Paris to Los Angeles based on a 
Homeland Security advice. After investigating the passengers identified 
as potential terrorists the French discovered a diplomat, a professional 
athlete, and a man who wasn't traveling. The non-traveler was on the 
list because he has an Arab sounding name and a pilot licence. Turns out 
he is a pilot for a French airline who was taking Christmas off to be 
with his family.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since no terrorists showed up in France, Homeland Security has asked 
that the people who didn't show up for the flight be investigated. 
Missing the flight looks suspicious. The people who didn't show up might 
be terrorists who had second thoughts. Possibly they might be people who 
heard the announcements that the flights were cancelled. Tough call.
On television we would have all of the information about the people on 
the list at our fingertips. We would have done a computer search on each 
of the 'terrorist suspects' and have known who they were. In real life 
apparently having a suspicious sounding name is sufficient to get you on 
the list, without benefit of any further Homeland Security 
investigation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Appearing incompetent only works in favor of any terrorists we may be 
trying to stop. Crying wolf gets attention once or twice but after a 
while, the people crying wolf only separate themselves out as being 
people that can be ignored. `Being ignored' is not an effective tool.

Greetings from the wonderful world of Federal Prison!
I thought that some people might find a description of
life here interesting.
Feel free to toss this letter if you don't agree.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I left home on November 3, taking Amtrak from Dallas, TX
to New York City.
The trip was generally uneventful, but long (45 hours).
I prefer travelling by train as I hate to fly, and it was much cheaper
($118 for the ticket).
I spent the evening of November 5 at my father's house in New York,
and Thursday at 6AM we left home for the three hour journey to this place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At about 10AM we arrived, after taking one wrong turn that led us to the
Medium Security compound down the road.
Happily we were directed here to the Minimum Security Camp.
I am what's known as a "self-surrender", meaning I brought
myself to this camp as opposed to transferring from a higher
security location or being remanded in custody until sentencing.
Around 10:30, the R and D officers (Receiving and Departure)
took me inside for processing.
They asked my father to wait outside in the car so they could bring
him my clothes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I filled out some basic personal and medical information, had my photo
taken for my Bureau of Prisons ID, and then stripped for inspection.
All my clothes were sent back to my father, along with my watch and 
driver's license.
The only items I was permitted to keep were my eyeglasses (which I badly
need) and the $200 or so I had in cash, which was then deposited in
my inmate account for use on the phone or buying necessary items at
the commissary.
No cash is used here - all monies are spent electronically through 
your ID card (or transferred by phone to your telephone account).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The inspection itself is brief and not as bad as it could be.
Open your mouth, lift up your tongue, lift up your arms, show
the bottomes of your feet, lift your nuts, gently spread your
butt cheeks.
Then you are given your clothes for the first night.
Blue canvas slip-on sneakers, tube socks with holes in
the heels, undershirt, old pair of briefs, khaki pants and
shirt which are too big for you.
You also get one roll of toilet paper, a toothbrush, 
and a jar of tooth powder, plus a bedroll 
(2 sheets, one pillowcase, 2 thin wool blankets).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A physician's assistant takes your medical info again,
checks your vital signs, and off you go.
I was then directed to find an officer in "B" unit
up the hill from R and D.
The officer there gave me soem quick lectures on the rules, 
showed me my bunk, and told me to ask if I had any questions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This particular Federal Prison is a minimum security camp.
There are no gates, no armed perimeter guards.
Anyone deemed a security or flight risk is never sent here
to begin with.
The camp has three dorm buildings, but only one is currently
in use (the other two are empty).
At one time in 2003 this facility housed over 800 inmates,
but currently we have about 280, just enough to fill the
single dorm building.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The dorm itself has four dorm units, A and B are for inmates
currently in the Residential Drug and Alcohol Program (RDAP),
C does not exist, while D and E are for everyone else.
I live in Dorm BE (the E section of dorm building B).
The living space for each inmate starts with a metal
frame bunkbed.
I am on the top bunk, since beds are assigned by seniority.
The mattress is thin, the pillow hard, but you get used to it.
Next to the bed is a walkway of six feet by 2.5 feet - enough
room to stand in when you dress.
Each inmate also has a locker on the other side of the walkway,
and a writing shelf ("desk") the two bunkmates share.
That is the full content of a cubicle... there are 14 or so
2-person cubicles along two walls.
In addition, the center of the room has 20 or so one or two
inmate cubicles.
It's cramped, but tolerable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rest of the building contains various offices and classrooms
for staff or RDAP lessons, two TV rooms (one for RDAP and one for
everyone else), a front hall with four telephones per half-building.
and a bathroom with stalls, urinals, and an open shower area.
The TV room has seven sets, each capable of showing two or three
different channels, giving about 18 channel options overall.
The sound for the televisions is muted, with the sound broadcast
over FM band.
This makes a walkman radio a necessity if you want to watch any TV.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most of the inmates are here for various Federal drug offenses.
Some, but less, are white collar felons.
Almost everyone at this camp is here either to eventually participate
in the RDAP program or to work in the CADRE program at the camp's
Unicor plant manufacturing furniture for the government to sell.
Some worked their way through the system from higher security
facilities down to the camp.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My schedule here is fairly set on weekdays.
Up at 5:40 to get dressed, wash my face, and brush my teeth.
At 6AM breakfast is served.
Usually it's an egg or a biscuit, but generally I just go for
a cup or two of coffee.
The food at the camp is tolerable, cafeteria-type fare that some
inmates call garbage, but I find ranges from tasteless filler to
moderately tasty.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At 6:30 I return to my cubicle to sweep and mop it.
Then I watch TV until 7 when I go to work.
My current work assignment is at the Paint Shop.
We paint various parts of the camp or the nearby
"complex" (the low and medium security facilities).
Right now we're repainting the inside of a house that
a counselor from the medium security prison is moving
into in two weeks.
We work until about 11AM, then go to lunch.
After lunch it's back to work until 3PM.
At 4PM we have "standing count" when all inmates
must be standing in their cubicles.
Then it's mail call, dinner, and we can spend the 
rest of the evening as we see fit, until around 10PM when 
we have our next count.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The biggest trick to prison, especially this one, is finding ways 
to occupy your time.
I usually read, write letters, and watch videos on occasion in the
library.
I also listen to the radio quite a bit.
There are ACE classes, taught by inmates on various subjects, but
I missed signup on them and have to wait until January.
Working helps kill the week, even though wages are about 12 cents
an hour.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Surprisingly the bathrooms have stalls, so life's most intimate
moments have some privacy.
The shower can hold six but inmates generally only use two at a time.
When you want to shower you yell out "how many?" into the shower
area.
If they say "one" or there is no response, you proceed.  
If they say "two" that means two people are already in there, so you
wait in line until someone comes out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Phone calls are available, but you must submit any number you wish to call
on a form to the Bureau of Prisons so they can approve it.
Each inmate is allowed 300 minutes a month, if they can afford it... calls
are 20 cents a minute unless you call collect.
When you place a call, the system alerts the person answering that it is
a call from a Federal Prison, announces who is calling, and gives them
a number to push to accept the call, another to block ALL future calls,
and if no response is received the call simply ends (for example, if
an answering machine picks up).
A call can only last 15 minutes (it cuts off automatically at that point)
and every five minutes a voice reminds the people on the line "This call
is from a Federal Prison."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mail is distributed weekdays.
All incoming mail must include both the inmate name and his ID number.
Every envelope is opened beforehand to look for contraband.
Outgoing mail must include the full name, number, address, and prison
on the return address.
Inmates can receive letters, cards, non-polaroid photos, magazines, newspapers,
and softcover books.
Hardcover books can only be received if sent directly from a book club or
bookseller (Amazon.com or Barnes and Noble, for example).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rules are pretty straightforward.
Keep your bed made and area clean.
Do not possess any contraband, and keep your items on hand to the 
allowable limits (10 pair of underwear, 2 sets of sweatpants and sweatshirts,
4 batteries, etc.).
Be where you are supposed to be.
Never miss a count.
Do not bring food out of the mess hall.
All easy to follow if you concentrate.
Random breath and urine tests occasionally find inmates drinking or using drugs.
Those caught are thrown in the hole and later transferred out of the camp.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For recreation, the camp has a gym and weight room, 1/2 mile walking trail, and
the usual assortment of board games.
Gambling is not allowed but likely exists, both on sporting events and card or
domino games.
Organized basketball, soccer, and softball teams play in season.
I've met some decent folks, but in many ways the camp is reminiscent of a
college dorm.
Loud yelling, stupid fights, cramped quarters, and rude immature males
farting and belching constantly, leaving messes and showing absolutely
no consideration for other people.
What do you expect?
Even as a generally safe camp, it's still prison.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's about it for now.
If you have any questions let me know.
I've been forwarded my <i>Maniac's Paradise Lost</i> material and will run
these games by handwritten flyer to their conclusion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK SPIN OFF SHOW "7 OF 9 OR BUST!" - EPISODE ONE, PARALLEL THIS!):
Captain's log unknown, during the battle with the Romulans, the Enterprise
and her crew have mysteriously been transformed into Ferengi, a Ferengi ship called
"Cheatem", and are now in what appears to be Breen space.
While the location of our ship appears to be Breen, this area of space
clearly is controlled by the Ferengi.
An hour ago, we were fighting wtih our Klingon "allies" for the survival
of the Federation.
Now we are in a freighter apparently designed for selling and transport
of tulaberry wine. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk (K) - Hey Bones!
How come starships always are called "Her"?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
McCoy (M) - Damnit, Jim!
I'm a Doctor, not a philosopher!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Actually, you're a corpse!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock (S) - Is it possible they are called "Her" because we
never really have control over them?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Never mind that, where are we?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I cannot say for certain, but I do have a theory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Damnit, Jim, he always has a theory!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - You know, Doctor, you are even more irrational now that you
are dead than when you were alive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What is your theory, Spock?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I believe we have been transported to the perpendicular to
the perpendicular universe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Am I dead there too?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - You're gonna be!
How did we get here?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Per your orders, we transported 5 proton torpedoes to a location near
the Romulan advance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Damnit, Jim!
You can't transport a semi-active proton torpedo thru a transporter matrix!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Actually, Doctor, the transport was successful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Successful!
You call everyone getting changed into Ferengi successful?!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Everyone except Mr. Spock, you mean.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Yeah, Spock!
Why is that?
Why are you still a green blooded, pointy eared Vulcan?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - I think I know why!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Thrill me with "your" theory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - It's because of Roddenberry!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Gene Roddenberry?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Yeah, Gene Roddenberry, he never liked me and he always 
favored Mr. (Ears up Roddenberry's ass!) Spock.
<i>((Just to interject a note of reality, Gene DID conceive
of Spock's character and introduce Spock first, remember the
first pilot, "The Cage", first come, first served....))</i>
Every time we get changed into something, the effect never
changes Spock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - He's dead, Jim!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Excuse me!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Roddenberry!
Gene Roddenberry!
He's dead, Jim!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Could that explain why the shows "Voyager" and "Enterprise" suck
so bad?
I mean it's like the writers of the show have never seen Star Trek
before.
So now I have to live this episode as a Ferengi!
Yuk!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I'm afraid our situation is much worse than
that, Captain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What do you mean?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - According to the Enterprise scans before the change, one
of the imported proton torpedoes ignited a micro-second too fast,
causing a massive power surge in the Enterprise transporter beam.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Imported proton torpedo?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Yes.
Starfleet refuses to pay union scale to Earth proton torpedo
manufacturers so they import them from slave labor sweat shops
on Orion.
<i>((Another reality note, I generally try to standardize Star
Trek spellings to the official ones used in the books and scripts, 
but I'm leaving pRoton torpedo, which is a 
Star WARS invention, since this may be an intentional move
on the part of the unknown writer - recall that all <b>TAP</b>
press is black - we'll just have to see, if it wasn't intentional,
perhaps in the next episode it will migrate back to the Star
TREK pHoton torpedo.... back to your regularly scheduled
programming...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - So I have to be a Ferengi in this episode because Starfleet
bought proton torpedoes from  the lowest bidder?!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Spock, can you pinch his neck or something!?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Nerve pinches don't work on Ferengi.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Or corpses!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - In any event, the surge in the transporter probably
caused a dimensional shift.
According to Starfleet science, in theory, a perpendicular
universe would have to exist in subspace in order to anchor
the two parallel universes.
The point of intersection in subspace would, in theory, be
stable protomatter, like the matter used in the "Genesis
device", only stable.
This matter and the fact that the battle took place near
Ferengi space left us with a Ferengi signature.
I'm also pretty sure that the Klingons got transported too,
and to make matters even worse, the transporter matrix also
showed a duplication signature similar to that really lame
episode when Commander Riker got duplicated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - You mean there is a duplicate Captain Kirk and crew
in our universe with our same memories and past?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Yes, Captain, I would suggest that since they stayed
in our universe they would not have been exposed to the
protomatter and would thus remain intact.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that they are even aware of
our existence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - What about the Romulans?
Did the torpedoes destroy them?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I don't think so, they reinforced their shields when they 
detected the transport.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Scotty!  Is there any Romulan Ale on board?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Scotty (SC) - I dun think so, Captain, it's all been transformed
into Ferengi Spotted Beetle Juice, and the entire cafeteria
inventory has turned into 109 varieties of edible insects.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Damn!
So let me get this straight, as a result of a battle transporter
accident, me and the crew and the ship (except for Mr. Spock)
have been turned into Ferengi, our identical twins in our universe
have been unaffected, are still in our universe and are unaware
of our existence, we don't have any knowledge of the strength or
disposition of the aliens in the perpendicular universe, we
command a freighter that doesn't have a fraction of the power
necessary to send us home and even if we did, our universe
is unaware of our existence, and wouldn't really have a place
for us anyway because of the duplication, and the Klingons,
led by the evil Commander Worf from the parallel universe
are here!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - That is essentially correct, Captain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What about the Klingons?
Do you think they were changed into Ferengi?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - I'd buy a ticket to that!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Unlikely, Doctor.
Roddenberry also favored the Klingons, just like the Vulcans.
There is some good news.
First, the Federation in our universe is dying.
Because the Bajorans, Cardassians, and Commander Worf could never
work together, the Romulans have been basically handed the Universe
without any major battles.
I would also like to point out that Lt. Uhura, Yeoman Rand, and 7 of 9 are
on board.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - So what?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Jim, Ferengi women have to go around naked.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - 7 of 9 as a naked Ferengi, I'll pass....
(Hey, Jim, you want me to write Kim Cattrall into this?)
<i>((Hey, your choice, I'm not going to impose writing constraints
on you, whoever it is that "you" are..... ))</i>
(At that moment, 7 of 9 walked into the conference room, she was a
4'2" naked Ferengi female.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Scotty!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
SC - Aye Captain!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Beam me directly into space!...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - At least Uhura isn't singing....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Hey, if Janice and Uhura are there, I'd take your place, Captain Kirk!
My, my, get started with a bang, eh?
We ain't done yet, and we still haven't had Spring 1901 moves.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-MEKONS): So, we meet again!!!! Be happy the GM is on your side 
personally I would rather quote say rap, rock, pop-rock, and now a little 
heavy metal. Jim, no offense intended just not my preference, lol. Been here 
done that, might as well have fun with it though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): Might as well...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-JIM): I can't believe I'm asking this; Where would I look to listen to a 
CD of the Mekons if nothing else you sparked my curiosity..........WHAT IN 
SAM HILL AM I THINKING!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): You really should pick up <i>OOOOH! Out of their Heads</i>.
It's their latest CD and it should be in any decent sized record store.
If you're talking about listening on the Web, I don't do that sort of thing,
so I can't help you, though I think you can find some samples on Amazon.com.
But the Mekons are more than a rock band, they are quite simply a way of life,
an attitude, and a community.
They have idealism and humor and a realistic attitude about what is.
There simply is nothing else like them.
And who else pulls their biggest fans up on stage to dance with the band
during live concerts?
I can tell you from experience that if you stand in the front row and scream
the lyrics (on key) back at them for a whole concert, that is what will happen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to ALEXANDRE): I just want to formally thank you guys for the really 
cool statue.
New York Harbor wouldn't look the same without it!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD PART 3): Can't we all just get along??.................where would 
the fun be then????

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF-SEAN):...........

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD ESPECIALLY JIM-BOB): It's Uncle Jeffy Pooh not Uncle Jeffy! Here 
we go again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF-BOARD): No, no, no. It's Jeff the OH GREAT ONE. Also I'm not the King or 
Prime Minister or President of France. I am the Petty Dictator of France.

(SCOTLAND SINGING): Williams on my shoulder makes me frightened.
But I hope we continue to get along.
Fleet Sweden waves to unruly new neighbors in Denmark.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TSAR to KAISER):  Get all the freaking spam out of your mailbox so that 
important letters like DipStuff can get through in a timely manner.  
(Filters are available to get rid of Penis Enlargement offers, and sales 
pitches for Viagra and Paris Hilton's sex tape.)

1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
This next turn will be one game year by that measure.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
The two man race among those who actually are playing is winding down....

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) You all have the rules, don't you?
They're on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Spaces 2, 3, and 4 are overcrowded, which keeps almost everyone's
replenishment schedule pretty condensed.
Should be a lot of fun for the next turn, since we also had a breaking
away cyclist from Bruce.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BART - &gt;  MOE):  I'm calling for Ms. Holdme, first name Amanda.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MOE - &gt;  BAR):  I'm looking for Amanda Holdme.  Amanda Holdme!  Why
can't I find Amanda Holdme!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARNEY):  Maybe your standards are too high?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE FIRM to THE FIELD): Greetings and good luck to all!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CHIEF WIGGUM - &gt;  PLAYERS):  OK, I'll be maintaining security for this
bicycle race.  We'll keep focus on the roads and crowds at all times.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WIGGUM - &gt;  FELLOW POLICE):  I'll be right back, off to the donut shop.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE FIRM to THE SOILS): Hope it doesn't rain!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FLANDERS - &gt;  HOMER):  Do you think you'll be able to beat the Howells
this time?  He's racing a bunch of rocks.  Shouldn't be hard, dontcha
think?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOULDER to RACE REFEREE):  What's with that Partridge?  He's got another Diamond
on his team...  I suppose he thinks he can cut through to a win with hard
riding...?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE FIRM to IT'S IN THE CARDS):  Your team suits you!  Hope you haven't
stacked the deck.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOMER - &gt;  FLANDERS):  Shut up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FLANDERS):  Okalee dokalee!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOULDER to EVERYONE BUT DESPER):  Geez, Rick must be getting Desperate: he's
employed a rider who'll throw caltrops on the track.  Better keep a sharp eye on
THAT Joker!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MR. BURNS - &gt;  FRANKLIN):  I knew a Franklin in my youth.  Name of
Benjamin.  I wonder what happened to him?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BURNS): Hmmm, you must retire early....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LISA - &gt;  WORLD):  I'm going to dedicate this game to the memory of
Snowball the Cat.  Ahem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MEDITATION ON TURNING EIGHT, BY LISA SIMPSON):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had a cat named Snowball -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She died!  She died!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mom said she was sleeping -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She lied!  She lied!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why oh why is my cat dead?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Couldn't that Chrysler hit me instead?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm keeping only one list for the new game now up above.
This is scary, the game has gone on for six years now, hasn't it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The end is starting to look close too.... Germany forgot about one of his units,
or seemed to.
And while Egypt made a great play to annihilate Syria, that isn't a supply center,
and the Italian peninsula is overrun.
I was tempted to put a game exclamation point on that convoy to Naples.
The Mekons quote below is intended also to refer to this move and how it
might have been accomplished.
We'll see what happens next.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "Continuing on our way through Sicily;
We came upon the site, where now stands the city of Syracuse,
there we made our sacrifice;
And Heracles cried; At the scene of the crime."
Off "Myth", the lead cut on <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): I hope this helps you out.
May I suggest Pie-Tus, this way next year we can put a force there to 
attack Ukraine in Italy, or is Pie needed elsewhere?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT to JIM): I don't think anything can stop Ukraine with the 
infighting between Germany, England, and Spain inexplicably still
going on.
I won't quit, but I do have an idea for my Star Trek "season finale".
Please let me know when the last press is when you declare Dave (the 
evil Romulan Peator) the winner.
<i>((Don't worry, it will be clear, and I've got the Miller Number 
Custodian on my back to wrap up these things quickly.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-UKRAINE): Ummm maybe next month I'll be on your side or maybe not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN to PAUL AND JIM): Long story.
<i>((Indeed, let's finish up with one more baseball comment.
What an issue, eh?
Sorry it's late, but I think it's a keeper.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): Hey Jim, I think it's a conspiracy, the networks
want you guys to win.
If healthy, the Red Sox may win 125 games, I'm lovin' it.
<i>((Well, since the other teams in the lower part of the
division have improved, I think this will balance out.
We'll see, and I hope your optimism is well founded.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PS I still hate Pedro and Manny!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PPS How come you guys didn't interview Mike Hargrove?
<i>((Because he never managed Schilling?))</i>
