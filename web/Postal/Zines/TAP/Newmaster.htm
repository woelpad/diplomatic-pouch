<p class=MsoNormal>THE PROPER PLACE FOR A FLEET IS ON THE WATER!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Ron Newmaster</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reprinted from <i>Northern Flame</i> #87, November 2002</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some years ago while playing in my maiden PBM Dip game I had
the good fortune of having Rob Lesco playing Austria adjacent to my
Russia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though the record may show that
Lesco’s Dip skills have deteriorated with advancing years, I assure you his
inaugural effort was a masterful achievement of skillful tactical play within
sound strategy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I heard he equaled his
maiden outing several years later by again achieving a second place
survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the course of the 89CG
game we exchanged at least seventy letters each.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Many times our missives crossed in the mail.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many times we simultaneously congratulated
each other on how great minds ‘think alike’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The afterglow continues to this day such that I still count Rob as a friend
not yet seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of Diplomacy tenets, however, required considerable
repetition before Rob grudgingly acquiesced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Fleets are the force multiplier of Diplomacy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Each power needs multiple fleets and fleets for the most part
belong on water, at sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, I will
admit that the circumstances at the time which led me to exhort gullible Rob to
build fleets and set them adrift might well have stemmed from my desire to see
Austria and the Balkans stripped of all those armies he was stockpiling, but
the idea has lingered on and survived the tests of time and use.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ‘fleet force multiplier tenet’,
initially born of paranoia, has become an article of faith in my own play.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You must have multiple fleets in order to be
a significant factor in the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though seven landlocked Supply Centers are untouchable to fleets,
more Supply Centers…. England, Turkey, Tun, Por, Rom/Nap (A Apu supports Rom)…
are impregnable unless fleets are used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A fleet provides strategic and tactical advantages that belie its
rules-based parity with an army unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In chess a knight is deemed slightly more valuable than a
bishop in the early stages of game whereas the bishop assumes a more valuable
role, when the board is cleared of intervening pieces.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It projects power at a distance, something
the knight cannot do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So it is in
Diplomacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A fleet provides the means
to project the power of the state well beyond its contiguous land borders.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That power is demonstrated directly by the
fleet move itself or indirectly through convoying armies via the transient land
bridge available to the game player controlling the fleet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Granted, you may be able to rent a fleet
from another player for convoy purposes but the diplomatic cost may be
high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is no assurance that the
army units thus ferried will ever be actively used again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What else can fleets do that armies cannot?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They bypass occupied land spaces.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The relatively large sea provinces of the
gameboard enable fleets to travel great distances in a short time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He who controls the sea lanes controls where
the battle is joined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And, once joined,
units in the littoral provinces are subject to support from the sea or naval
bombardment as the case warrants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If
your army beachhead is about to be overwhelmed, it need not be lost to
annihilation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most sea provinces border
on multiple ‘targets’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When one is
adequately defended, hyperjump to the next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Fleets enable armies to be marines in the most versatile sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve heard it said, ‘In the land of the blind, the one-eyed
man is King.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Diplomacy, fleets
provide a slight advantage in maneuverability over near-sighted army
builders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Given equal play that
advantage becomes manifest in the mid-game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If your fleets are unopposed, you control the strategic options
regarding changing the location of conflict.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>To maintain control of the tempo of operations you always need one more
fleet than your opponent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You need more
force to disrupt his convoys; you need more units to breach the sea
bottlenecks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If your opponent builds
fleets, you need to build at least one more than he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m sure Teddy Roosevelt and Machiavelli would both have
agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To win in Diplomacy, speak
softly and build fleets.</p>
