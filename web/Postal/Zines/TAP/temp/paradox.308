Hi Ahmed, 

Interesting comment..... first of all, no, you are not correct, an .exe of 
Diplomacy to play against "bots" is not at all easy.  There is a Yahoo 
group dedicated to the design of these things.  It's called "dipai".  I 
put that out there since someone who needs to see that and is not a member 
can join.  But I don't recommend that you join.  

The product that tried to do what you are talking about was designed by 
Paradox, released in Feb. 2005.  But by all accounts I've heard, it became 
very popular in Russia, but hasn't done very well in the English speaking 
world.  You can find out more at:

http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=295

The posts in there explain how Paradox tried and basically gave up to do 
what you're asking.  This is because Diplomacy is a deceptively complex 
game.  VERY deceptively complex because it appears to be so simple on a 
number of levels.  Perhaps this is what draws you to the game.  If so, I 
would urge you to dare to play with humans at a slower pace.  It really 
does reward the effort.

I think you can still purchase the Paradox game and play it, and if you 
read the posts above, you won't have overly high expectations to be 
dashed.  I think one can learn about the game via Paradox's product, but 
you will quickly become bored with it, especially playing against 6 
computer bots, and will come out to play the real thing.

(and by the way, game creator Allen Calhamer is alive and well -- David 
Cohen asks this in one of his Paradox posts -- and so is THE Game)

And, as I told you before, I would join the Redscape community and I think 
you'll find most of what you're looking for.  That's www.redscape.com.
