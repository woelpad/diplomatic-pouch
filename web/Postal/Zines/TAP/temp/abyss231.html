<p><br><p><br>LAST SECOND (a note from Phil Reynolds arrived literally just
as I was printing the final version) NOTE: It looks like John
Schultz may finally be getting out of prison!!  Yay for him!!
We have a new address that might or might not be valid.  As for
myself, I will be sending him this issue to both addresses and
I would advise you all to do the same.  
I hope we hear more definitively from John shortly.

<p>
John Schultz: POB 1322, Valparaiso, IN 46384

<p>
In any case, this issue is very specially dedicated to John as one of
the best people I have met postally via this hobby.  Cheers ;-)

<p>
Special tax time delayed issue..... I pushed deadlines back an extra
week to compensate (also the Tinamou deadlines, see the new deadlines
below).
As always when I get a bit behind (and this is still a huge issue)
I've held some really good reading material for next time.
Unlike the subszine dominated issues, this is mostly me.

<p>
Boy, do I wish my losses on the szine were tax deductible.... as most
of you know, I lose over a thousand dollars a year on this, but choose
not to document the losses precisely since I don't think I want to know.
And of course, some of the losses are determined by my liberal policy
toward including the hobby veterans, but I wouldn't lose them for an
instant!  That's what makes this fun!!

<p>
<b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE IS EITHER APRIL 17TH OR APRIL 24TH</b>

<p>
The 17th applies for Who's Your Buddy, Milk and Cookies, and 
Tour de Farce.
David also has a few corrections to last issue.....

<p>
Hello,
Tinamou #24 is now up on the web at:

<p>
http://devel.igo.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/Tin24/Tin24.htm

<p>
There were several corrections in the game adjudications.  These
corrections are all reflected in the web version.  They were:

<p>
English fleet Norway in Copernicus must retreat to SKA or OTB.

<p>
In Tour de Farce, Teddy and Koala's original positions were not
deleted.  This led to Koala incorrectly receiving a 15 replacement card
when he should have gotten a 7.

<p>
In Milk &amp; Cookies, Sweet Sara did not belie her name and throw a
nasty snowball at Zamboni.  She instead occupied herself sculpting
several more aesthetically pleasing spheres to add to her collection.

<p>
My apologies for the mistakes, hopefully the next issue will go more
smoothly.  Early orders will of course help matters immensely.

<p>

<center>Best regards, Dave, rebhuhn of rocketmail.com</center><br>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
But there are some other options.
Please consider joining Mark Kinney's regular Diplomacy
game start if you want to get going in one.
Let's help Mark get at least ONE regular Diplomacy gamestart.
We have to have it in us......
five players supposedly are signed up so far.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR GARRET SCHENCK - FOUND!</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>The reward for resolving a certain mystery that currently exists
in our hobby is still open.
I have heard rumors that progress is being made.
I won't be announcing another person to search for until Issue #235
while we allow time to search this mystery.
Feel free to assist Brenton Ver Ploeg or others to solve it.
I shall be saying nothing more about it.

<p>
Or spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert has thrown in another ten spot to Marie Beyerlein
for finding Garret Schenck.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
Let's start with Garret's return....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Garret Schenck (Mon, 27 Mar 2000 14:29:08 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
Okay guys, PAY UP!  Marie found me.  And man, did she have nice bait: a very 
nice Games Research Dip set still in factory shrink-wrap AND this humongous 
box version of Avalon Hill WATERLOO, which until I saw her ad I had no idea 
even EXISTED!  (Yes, it's about 21 X 14 X 2 inches and supposedly AH put out 
WATERLOO and one or two others in this oversize format back in the early 60s.)

<p>
WHY you guys wanted me this badly, I'll never know.  But apparently Jim you owe Marie $25.00.  And what do I get out of this?  I suspect probably not 
much, maybe an issue or two of TAP and the dubious pleasure of hearing 
certain unnamed persons deliver unnecessary Parthian shots about my <i>ZR</i> 
performance.  But this does seem like a very cool way to compensate Marie for 
the absurdly low price she gave me for WATERLOO!
 
<p>
And as for you, Emmert, give it up!  I am pretty sure I know why YOU are 
after me, and I give you a final chance to avoid the public humiliation that 
will surely follow should you actually achieve what I fear, for your own 
sake, you are seeking.  But if you insist I am prepared to carry through on 
all terms of our wager, I only warn you that the passage of four years will 
not help your ``cause."  Um, just what WERE the terms, anyway?

<p>
Well, I'll close for now.  Thanks for ``finding me"....smile.....

<p>

<center>Garret, GSchenck42 of aol.com</center><br> 

<p>
<i>((Worse than that, you have a LIFETIME subscription to <i>TAP</i>.... 
I have had some people complain after being
found that it is unfair that they get a (what, worthless???) lifetime
subscription to TAP and the finder gets real value.  Since Marie put up
real value to pay you, I plan to send her a check for $25.  I will send
Emmert the address.
Thank you very much, Marie, for tracking this one down.  We've been
looking for Garret for what, about TWO years!?!  This is a regular
feature of TAP, Garret.  There are still other people to look for
if you want to earn your own bucks.  Marie and Doug Beyerlein themselves
were found in an earlier part of the contest.
The one I ***REALLY*** want to find right now is Jerry Lucas.  A shame
that it is such a common name.... and no, I don't mean the ex-basketball
player.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Garret Schenck (Mon, 27 Mar 2000 18:50:40 EST)</b>

<p>
Hmmmm......Marie didn't put up any money....the way it worked is:  I bought a 
very nice Games Research set from her (she had it up on eBay).  I was 
intrigued by the name Beyerlein which very definitely rang a bell, but I 
didn't ask her about it, at least at first (also I didn't have any timely Dip 
materials at hand, a random copy of PDO Census from early 90s didn't turn up 
any Beyerleins).

<p>
She subsequently offered for auction a weird piece of Avalon Hill history: 
the oversize Waterloo.  She amazingly didn't get any bids (I think I was 
asleep along with everybody else) and when I asked her if she'd sell it to me 
for her (rather low) starting bid, she agreed, further undercharging herself 
for the shipping.  That's when we discovered our mutual Hobby interests.  So 
I was feeling guilty (well, as I said to Marie, only as guilty as any Dipper 
feels when he acquires somebody else's property: It's MINE now!) and your 
offer of a finder's fee goes sort of partway to compensate for my getting 
this real jewel for so cheap.
<i>((The bucks have been sent....))</i>

<p>
Here's my postal address, I guess I will take you up on your (worthless??) 
lifetime subscription offer:
Garret Schenck, 392 Montague Rd #29, Sunderland, MA  01375.

<p>
Don't know Jerry Lucas, he must be from before my time (which is the same as 
Emmert, actually, we started in the hobby right around the same time and same 
zine:  <i>Retaliation</i>).

<p>
Anyway, thanks for ``finding" me:  now I know how the Indians may have 
felt.....smile.....

<p>
Hi Jim, thanks in advance for the ``reward," and double-thanks for not paying
in hobby credits, since I've been out of Diplomacy for more than 20 years!
I am rapidly approaching my ``sunset years", and the money might better be
applied to something like a new walker or that extra set of teeth.

<p>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Emmert (Mon, 3 Apr 2000 12:55:59 -0400)</b> 

<p>
Obviously, I am very happy to get my friend back.  Marie, you have
earned your fee.

<p>
It's great to have Garret back in the community, even if he just keeps a
toe in it.  You will find, as I did when we met way back in the
eighties, that he is a marvelous presswriter (the trait most important
to we Dippers in the know) if you can sweet-talk him into joining a
game.  He's ugly as sin, but that's not a handicap in postal Dip.

<p>
Garret and I first corresponded in about 1986 when we both subscribed to
Dick Martin's late, very lamented zine, <i>Retaliation</i>.  
<i>((Just in case you guys were wondering, Dick is still around here
and I talk to him every once in awhile since we are in John Caruso's
baseball league together.))</i>
I wasn't even in
his game, but month after month, I kept seeing this wonderfully written
press with wild character names and titles, and preposterous situations.
I finally decided to write something of a fan letter to him, telling him
what I thought of his press.  We corresponded on and off for a while,
and finally met at Kathy and John Caruso's house in Queens (I think; all
those Noo Yawk places look alike except Manhattan).

<p>
When Garret took the plunge into publishing, he offered me a slot as a
columnist, and I took him up on it.  He titled the column, ``The Lawyer
Speaks,"  but I frequently discussed subjects other than law.  History,
politics, Dip of course, and whatever else struck my fancy.  Garret,
like Jim-Bob, was always eager to insert his input amid the writer's
comments, and that made for very interesting reading.  I was very sorry
when he folded <i>Upstart</i>, but fully understood his reasons for doing so.
If there is ever a revival, I'll plunk down the dough for a
subscription.

<p>
Garret, welcome back.  The beers at Fenway this summer are on me.

Now for some comments from the peanut gallery.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Richard Weiss (Tue, 21 Mar 2000 20:19:55 PST)</b>

<p>
Jim;
Lots of college basketball in this issue.  My son is now getting free 
trips, shoes, etc. to play basketball.  Maybe I'll know something about the 
college teams in 4-5 years when the recruiting starts (if he keeps growing.  
6' at 13).
<i>((We look forward to it.))</i>
   
<p>
In the Master's Tournament, I rescued my Freudian tactical error, voted 
for a 4-way one time and then had the GM interpret player-player-all players 
including GM press as voting yes, and I had to argue that he cannot 
interpret and the game must go on.  He resumed it, and now a German NRR 
gives France a clear shot at tying me for the lead or possibly getting it 
himself in the next three seasons (all the time that is left).  I have a 
50-50 chance of getting another SC, possibly two if Germany continues to be 
erratic.  Finally the French is playing with excellent tactics.  I think it 
is because he asked his team for help.  Like some non-Presidential 
candidates, I already told my Captain, that if I get into the semis that I 
am not playing.  That helped me clear my thinking.
   
<p>
I miss the old zines that had notices of house cons.  I congratulate Edi 
Birsan for creating a more global list.  I would go to one or two per year 
somewhere if I knew where and when they are.  I ask anyone involved in 
<i>TAP</i> who knows of a house con to insure it gets on Edi's list.

<p>

<p><br><p><br><b>Nick Parish (Mon, 20 Mar 2000 20:54:24 EST)</b>

<p>
Hi Jim,
Good stuff.  Just a quick comment.  British tourney games don't usually go 
for a randomised ending any more.  In fact, other than tournaments I have 
run (!) I have only ever been to one that did this - Manorcon in 1993.  
<i>((Yes, but that was the ONE that I attended, so apologies if I
thought that the way that went was the norm.))</i>
The one-day Oxford tournament that I or Stretchy run annually is usually 
randomised ending, but no other.  I like randomised ending because it 
encourages people to play a ``normal" game of Diplomacy more than any other 
system.  But others criticise it because they say that it builds randomness 
into a non-random game, and that in any case ``playing the tournament" rather 
than playing the game is the whole reason people enter tournaments!

<p>

<center>Cheers, Nick, nick_parish of hotmail.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I'm squarely in YOUR camp.
Thanks!
Sure you don't want to get the szine postally?))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Paul Rauterberg (Sun, 26 Mar 2000 12:36:08 -0600)</b>

<p>
Guys, this wraps up my end of the fiasco.  
The Germans/Austrians threw the game to
France in a snit over Turkish behavior; I kept pointing out that they'd
get no points out of this, but they were beyond caring.

<p>

<center>Paul, prosit of execpc.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Hi guys,  So you guys had some wacko experiences too, eh? 
[Paul sent this to his team members too, I wrote this next line
before the end, obviously]
It looks like the <i>TAP</i> team will finish just short of the Top 10 as
we had a ``dumb" French player give up on a position for no particular
reason so our last game ended up a board topping tie instead of a
straight board topper.
Stan's Also Rans was the winner and Armchair Diplomats was second.  
I don't really know anyone on either team, but the Armchair Diplomats 
are the top players from the E-Mail ancient CompuServe hobby, I believe.  
Lots of European teams did well (who also were well acquainted with the 
scoring system), the Judge Diplomacy teams fared poorly as did the US teams 
other than us.  What I thought was really neat was that the other teams with
<i>TAP</i> people on them (who turned me down) did not do as well.  
(grin)
The only individual player that advanced from that group was Dave Partridge
and Richard Weiss did very well but fell just short of advancing,
he did not have to make the ``play or not'' decision.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Warren Goesle (Fri, 07 Apr 2000 13:56:53)</b>

<p>
Stan's Also Rans include Stan Kellett, who does the website for <i>The Flat
Earth Society</i>, along with Warren Ball (also a <i>TFES</i> subber), and Don
Scheifler, who was the lying Austrian son-of-a-bitch on my original board.
I think that Stan actually got shut out, Warren Ball solo'd and Scheifler
had 2nd (12 SC Austria to a 14 SC Germany).  I don't know about their other
players.
With Ball, Partridge, Brady Boyd and O'Kelley, TFES has *4* subbers in the
semis.

<p>

<center>Goz, gozcorp of iquest.net</center><br>  

<p>
<i>((Ah yes, and lots of MY subbers know Don Scheifler VERY well as he 
was quite prominent in the mid-1980's US hobby too!
Thanks for the clarification, Goz!))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Sat, 1 Apr 2000 10:07:52 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
The game I'm GMing ended with Italy wresting his 12th center
from Russia, who finished tied with France at 11.  A nice exciting
finish, what I'd hoped from most of the games.  But I really think
there were a lot of relative beginners in the first round.  
In my first adjudication, I missed the fact that Serbia had passed
from Russia to Italy, so Russia had a short-lived feeling of glory.

<p>
The sad thing is that Tim Crosby, who played such an excellent game
to end up at 12 SCs, will not make Round Two.  Because he didn't
win by enough points.  

<p>
Rule number one for designing a tournament should be based on the
premise that the players can only compete against those players who
are in the same game.  The unfairness of denying some table-toppers
a ticket to the second round because they didn't win by enough should
be quite obvious.  Based on this kind of logic, Florida wouldn't have
made the Final Four, since they barely beat Butler in the first
round.

<p>

<center>Rick, rick_desper of yahoo.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Let it join the list.
I think we should be happy that the tournament did not appear to be flooded
with ``pseudonym'' multiple players.
I am worried about both the beginners and the pseudonyms for next time.
Let me print all of the players in the second round and their game
assignments, just for those who are curious.
Then I'll follow that with the top team listings.))</i>

<center><b>DIPDOM NEWS SECTION (with letters)</center><br></b>

<p>
<p> Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<p>
I need to begin this section with an editorial regarding a number of
issues that I have been working very hard behind the scenes.

<p>
1) The fate of <i>Diplomacy World</i>: At the time when Doug Kent was
leaving the hobby, he arranged to pass the Editorship to Pitt 
Crandlemire.  But, after a great deal of effort on my part and
others to get an answer from Pitt, it is clear that Pitt has dropped
the ball.  I know I waited much longer to say this than many people
wanted to wait.  All I can say is that I still treat this as a hobby
and cut people every possible degree of slack.  But this is it.
We will welcome Pitt's involvement, but it is time to resurrect
<i>DW</i>.  I have most of Doug's records, but the one thing I do 
not have is any of the sub money.  Another reason I waited and 
why now may be a good time to discuss this again is that Doug
Kent is making some tentative moves back into the hobby.  I am
hereby asking Doug nicely if there is any <i>DW</i> sub money left
and if it can be contributed to getting it restarted.  Others
may wish to add their voices to my nice request.  Write to Doug 
at 10214 Black Hickory Rd., Dallas, TX  75243.  I could say more
and I might next issue, but let's see if there is any interest.
Obviously, the first thing we need is someone to be Editor
and Publisher.  It won't be me, but I will assist whoever wants
to take it over.  I shall pass the records I have from Doug
to that person.

<p>
2) PDORA:  Keeping with the idea that Doug is showing his face again,
if there is any <i>DW</i> money, then perhaps the remaining PDORA money
might be available too.  I also have an interest in trying to revive 
this service.  Edi Birsan is doing many of the things that 
PDORA could or should be doing, but I keep worrying about Melinda 
trying to keep the Hobby Awards going where this funding could be 
very useful.  Again, this is a gentle request to Doug to ask him 
if there is any money here either.

<p>
3) World DipCon: Come to World DipCon!  This is going to be a GREAT 
hobby gathering, perhaps the largest in at least the last decade.
There will be a minimum of a twenty Europeans coming over (based on
commitments already made and Edi Birsan's efforts) and the current
WorldMasters tournament has raised even more interest in Tournament
Dip.  Edi is still collecting money to assist Champion Europeans in
getting over here.  You may make your donations to Edi c/o Midnight
Games, PO Box 280, Medford, OR  97501.
That issue though, also has led to the need to state for the record
the following:

<p>
4) International Feuding: I just want to reiterate my longstanding
rule that I don't accept Not For Print feud letters.  If you send it
to me, you risk that I will pass it or make it public.  Someone
is impersonating me at the moment and making statements in my name
that I would never make.  If you get E-Mail that purports to be from
me and is NOT from burgess of world.std.com, ignore it.  Thanks.
I'm not angry about this, actually a bit bemused because the impersonation
attempt has been so lame, but it is important to make these statements
BEFORE something gets out of hand.

<p>
It arrived today.  So here you are...
Jonadab's Notes on Hasbro's Diplomacy Boardgame.

<p>
In spite of being released in 2000, all the copyright notices
say 1999, so this will forever be known as the 1999 edition,
I expect.  I can't say I'm displeased.  

<p>
The Box:  
16"x10.5"x3", give or take a smidgen.  You've seen scans of
the top cover art, so I won't waste bandwidth on that here.
The edges look similar but with less in the way of a
picture, saying ``Diplomacy" and ``THE GAME OF INTERNATIONAL
INTRIGUE".  The bottom has a ``Whom Do You Trust?" sidebar
with a good terse explanation of the basic style of the game
and a photo of the board with units set out beside it.  (IMO
the photo makes the French units look lighter than they
are.)  There is also a little image of a plaque explaining
that the game is for ages 12 and up, 2 (!) to 7 players, a
``challenging" (as opposed to ``moderate" or ``advanced")
complexity level, and a list of (most of) the game's
contents.

<p>
The Board:
The board looks good.  At twenty inches on a side, it is
smaller than I would have expected, but I don't think
clarity is inhibited for that.  It's a one-piece quadfold
design (split from the center (in Berlin) to the eastern
edge (in Moscow)).  It's an attempt at a compromise between
the advocates of political maps and those of geological
maps.  I would not have expected such a compromise to work,
but I actually rather like it.  If you don't look closely,
it looks like a geological map - not a contour map exactly,
but the mountains look mountainous and so forth.  The sea
looks especially good, darker the further you go from shore.
The borders are nice: black borders within countries and
between bodies of water, and white outlined in black between
countries (including between neutrals).  Coasts are nicely
shaded and look good, and there is a fair amount of detail
in terms of islands, fjords, and lakes.  Different countries
each have different amounts of brown/yellow/red/green and
dark/light (although not too much variation in the
dark/light department except that Switzerland is pretty
dark) built into their shading so that it is easy to
determine where national boundaries lie, even without the
white borders, the line between Germany and France being one
possible exception.  There is a superfluous but not
unpleasant graphic of a cannon in Sevastopol and one of a
ship (albeit an anachronistic one, like the markers (more
later)) in the Norwegian Sea as well as a nice gold compass
(with an N for north) in the North Atlantic, just above the
word ``Diplomacy".  Supply centers are marked with a
nice-looking round button-like graphic, shaded to look 3D,
of a gold star on a black circle outlined in gold.  Province
labels (and coasts) are spelled out in full (but are
abbreviated on the conference maps (Add ``Ty" to your list of
abbreviations for the Tyrrhenian")).  There is a misspelling
(``Galacia").  Each country has a label around the edge of
the board with its colour in the background of the name of
the country and its flag on either side.  (Russia's flag is
white with a blue X, for example; I assume this is from the
time period (unlike the ship) since I don't recognise it.)
It is clear that Spain does not touch North Africa.  It is
not altogether clear that the Baltic Sea touches Kiel.  The
Dardanelles and the Bosphorus both have border lines drawn
across them; we all know this is because the intervening sea
is part of the Constantinople province, but could have been
more clear.  The SC dot for Copenhagen has been
strategically relocated to bridge the gap between that
Island and mainland Denmark (vicinity of Ebeltoft); I assume
this was done for clarity.  (The rules state that Islands
cannot be occupied except for England.)  The SC dot for
Constantinople has also been relocated (to roughly modern
Luleburgaz or a little east; the southern edge of the dot
barely touches the Marmara Denizi).  Why it was not placed
at Istanbul is beyond me, as that would cover the Bosporus
and clarify the unified nature of the province, or so I
would have thought, quite aside from the impression I've
always had that Constantinople and Istanbul are the same
place.

<p>
Conference Maps:
You get twenty.  As mentioned, provinces are abbreviated;
coasts, OTOH, are spelled out.  They are black and white, of
course; the seas appear grey, but I assume this is done via
dithering.  

<p>
Pieces:  
You get ten armies and ten fleets in each colour.  They look
good, although as mentioned the ship is an anachronism.  The
cannon seems appropriate, though.  I can tell all the
colours apart even in dim light, although England
(relatively dark blue) and France (royal blue?) are clearly
the closest.  Italy is a fairly dark green; Russia's ``white"
is nearly silver in colour, or light grey at the least.
Germany's black is grey, too, but it's quite dark.  The red
units aren't too flashy but are clearly red.  Turkey's
yellow units are pretty dark; they could almost pass for
``gold".  They come between sheets of plastic that are melded
together in rows and columns between each sheet, so there
are two rows of fleets and two rows of armies in each
power's package.  I don't think, having opened each little
pouch, that you could realisitically store the units in
there, however; you'll probably want Ziploc bags or the
equivalent, unless you want to store everything in the
plastic tray provided (if it would even fit) and keep the
game upright at all times.

<p>
There is also a sheet of cardboard markers to designate SC
ownership.  These are 5/8 inch neosquares with rounded
corners; one side bears the nation's flag and the other side
bears its traditional colour (green, red, white, yellow,
black, navy, and sky blue; these are bold and bright and
flashy, unlike the more subdued units).  There are 22 for
each power, and they all come in a single sheet, prepunched
so that you can pop them out easily (and, in fact, keeping
them in the sheet if you don't want them out could be a
problem; again, I suggest getting zipper bags if you don't
want to lose parts).  

<p>
The Rulebook:
Standard US paper size (8.5" x 11"), 23 pages.  This is
where the big changes were made.  Most of them are not the
the rules themselves so much as the presentation.  My
biggest disappointment:  the handy reference numbers on the
rules that allow us to rever to (e.g.) IX.3 or VII.3.b are
gone.  The rules have also been reordered; this makes
comparing versions tougher, but I don't dislike the new
order.  The rules seem, for the most part, quite clear.
There are copious examples, with diagrams.  

<p>
``Turn" has now been given a definition; there are two turns
per year, Spring and Fall.  (Winter adjustments are phase 5
of the Fall turn and are called ``Gaining and Losing Units
Phase" (yes, ugh), although when the phase is explained in
more detail the term ``adjustments" is also given.)  

<p>
Bodies of water are now called provinces; there are also
inland and coastal provinces.

<p>
I see here what I <i>think</i> is a new rule or possibly a change
(although my other version is not the previously most
recent, so I'm not sure):  ``If a Fleet is ordered to one of
these [bicoastal] provinces, and it is possible for the
Fleet to move to either coast, the order must specify which
coast, [so far so good] or the Fleet does not move [new, I
think]".  

<p>
I'm going to attempt to correlate the order in the new book
with the rule numbers from my 1976 edition; these are
imprecise by necessity, as some reorganisation has been done.

                (from the 80's ruleset, I think), XII.4.
                Note that XII.4 has altered; I think this
                follows the spirit of the '80s ruleset more
                closely:  ``An Army convoyed using alternate
                convoy orders reaches its destination as
                long as at least one convoy route remains
                open."
                
<p>
Page 16:        XII.5, reworded:  ``A convoyed Army does not 
                cut the support of a unit supporting an
                attack against one of the Fleets necessary
                for the Army to convoy."  Further
                explanation and clarification is given.
                Also, ``An Army with at least one successful
                convoy route will cut the support given by a
                unit in the destination province that is
                trying to support an attack on a Fleet in an
                alternate route of that convoy."

<p>
Page 19:        XIV.2, start of sample game (runs through
                page 22, with commentary).

<p>
There is a handy list of abbreviations on the back,
organised by country, with neutrals and bodies of water each
being a category.  There is also, on page 23, a list of 22
simple rules to help resolving most situations:  things like
``Units cannot trade places without the use of a convoy".
(That one is #6.)  A note says, ``if you are unable to
resolve an issue using this listing, refer to the
instructions and examples within this booklet for more
detailed explanations."  

<p>
IMO not enough is said about the Game Master.  The Pouch is
not mentioned at all.  
You also get a plastic storage tray (with seventeen
indentations; eight each in two sizes and a long skinny one)
and a flier advertising ``the new Avalon Hill" (Legends,
Diplomacy, Axis &amp; Allies, Battle Cry, and Acquire).

<p>Comments on the 1999 year in music are still welcome.

The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll find a commercial service to copy them for me.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.

<p>
You all may recall that I ended this section last issue with the words: 
``I also will be rooting for Florida.''
Well, I did, and they fell just short.
You know, at the beginning, everyone (me included) knew that Michigan State
was the team to beat.
I hate going with the favorite, but I knew they were going to win.
Here's some more comments from our peanut gallery.
Again, as always, note those time stamps.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Mon, 20 Mar 2000 12:16:22 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
So much for Ohio State.
<i>((And I'm surprised they went down so easily!))</i>
And Temple, and Stanford.  I've now only got one Final Four team left.
Thankfully, that's MSU, but really, picking MSU to win everything is
not going to get me ahead of a lot of people with my picks.
<i>((I only have one left too, but it is UCLA.  
I like the pick and obviously I like them to beat MSU.  
Then I'll be happy as the brackets will be broken for everyone ;-) ))</i>

<p>
I'm so annoyed with myself for picking two Pac-10 teams to make the
Final Four!  I mean, I KNOW the Pac-10 teams ALWAYS fall flat in the 
tourney.  Grrr.  But still...UNC beating Stanford??  Hard to believe.
<i>((Yeah, I let Lute Olsen adoration take me too far too (I was a big Iowa
fan when he was there to show you how far back it goes), but I ***KNEW***
they wouldn't make the Final Four.  And I didn't like Stanford's lack
of athleticism on defense at all.  We forget, but North Carolina was
picked by many pundits BEFORE the season to win the National Championship
behind Cota and that big man of theirs whose name I forget, but he's 
tall and wicked quick.  I just HATE UNC and can't bring myself to 
pick them for anything.  More recently, they have been disappointing
to be sure, but obviously they are back to pre-season status.))</i>

<p>
The only positive I take from yesterday is that I picked Tulsa to beat
Cincinnati.   I've picked them to win one more game, and don't really
think Miami should be too much for them to handle.  
<i>((You got that one right, I will be rooting for whoever wins that game
to go all the way.  I sort of want a team that our lowly PC Friars
beat to win the National Championship.  We beat Miami IN Miami.))</i>

<p>
I was right to say that three Big East teams would make the Sweet
Sixteen, though there is no way I would have ever dreamed that the two
losers would be St. John's and UConn, the finalists in the Big East
tournament.  
<i>((WE totally agree on that.... although there is a LONG history of the
Big East Tournament finalists failing in the Big Dance as opposed
to the earlier losers doing better.))</i>

<p>
Given a chance to repick the Final Four from the Sweet Sixteen, I
would go with Tulsa from the South, Gonzaga from the West, OSU from
the East and MSU still from the Midwest.  I don't really like OSU that
much, but the East is gutted (it was really never strong to begin
with).  Even Seton Hall could win that now.  Half of the teams I
thought could beat MSU have already lost.  Sure, UCLA could beat them,
but they could also lose by thirty. Iowa State could beat them.  Right
now, I think whoever wins the Midwest will win it all.  Duke does not
have a great Duke team.  
<i>((I'm rooting for the Hall....))</i>

<p>
As a UCONN fan, I have to think that they would be in position to make
a Final Four run, had El-Amin not gotten injured.  The same could
easily be said about Cincinnati and Kenyon Martin.  
<i>((But you WILL agree that El-Amin has been inconsistent ALL season!
I stand on my opinion that El-Amin was going to have a bad game

I agree wholeheartedly Bush is a total coke freak. He scares the hell out of 
me.  Gore is a putz but he's our putz.  Fortunately for us we have the VERY 
interesting Hillary vs. Rudy in NY. That will be a fun one to watch the blood 
spill.  The presidential race already smells of rancid meat.  MY GOD HATH 
FORSAKEN ME! Maybe Russia will implode like Faz says and we will have 
something interesting to watch.

<p>
You said, ``I do agree about Kentucky" being overrated.  ARE YOU ON CRACK??  
Kentucky had the hardest schedule of ANYONE this year.
We beat Maryland;
We beat Michigan State 60-58;
We beat Tennessee 81-68;
We beat Florida 85-70.

<p>
Aren't two of the final four teams in there? A good Syracuse team B-A-R-E-L-Y 
scrapped by AFTER we got one of our best defensive players kicked off the 
squad.
PUH-leeze.  Ky basketball is better than anything this side of sliced bread.
7 NCAA championships (with 4 different coaches, TAKE THAT UCLA), more wins 
than anyone, more NCAA victories than anyone.

<i>((Now let's get to the GOOD stuff, the women's tournament....
I wrote the following to Rick:
Hey Rick, You probably haven't heard the brouhaha over here..... 
but Rutgers was forced to take a commercial flight back across the 
country last night (getting in very late) because the NCAA blew the 
arrangements for a charter.  The idea (true or not) is that they had 
been predicting Georgia would win and they had their charter set up 
and figured that the Rutgers people wouldn't care after they lost.  
Then they said that they tried to switch planes, but it was a Delta 
plane and Delta wanted it to go to Atlanta.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Wed, 29 Mar 2000 10:07:45 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
That's pretty ridiculous.  Why would the NCAA risk such
embarrassment? 
I mean, Rutgers was a number TWO seed.  It's irritating.
Before the tournament started, espn.com rated Rutgers as the 18th
best team, and predicted they would lose in the second round.  Fairly
disrespectful, I think.  But that is a typical problem for Rutgers
is most respects of its existence.   It has the unfortunate problem
of facing inevitable comparison with Princeton.  

<p>
<i>((Vivian and the team are supposedly mad
as hell.... hope it gets them through Tennessee to face UConn in
the
final, even if I will be rooting for them to lose the final ;-) ))</i> 
 
<p>
I would love to see a UConn/Rutgers final.  I would still root
for UConn, though.  Although you accused me of being a traitor, I was
a UConn men's hoops fan since the early '80s, and started rooting
for the women's team back in '93 or so.  Having two teams to root for
is a pleasant experience, and takes my mind away from the purely
awful things the Celtics are doing these days.

<p>
<i>((Then I will avenge my horrible picks in the Men's Tournament!  
Do you get ESPN etc. over there?))</i>

<p>
Well, you can take comfort in the fact that basically everybody got
only one team out of the Final Four picked correctly.  Who would
have picked Wisconsin or North Carolina?  I could have seen picking
Florida beforehand, as I knew they were a strong team, but I was
suspicious of the SEC in general since Tennessee had come from
nowhere to have such a strong year.  Dick Vitale is crowing that
he had UNC, Florida, and MSU all in his preseason Top Five, and
I think most people had all of them rated highly early in the season.

<p>
You may think your picks were bad, but I just got the <i>TAP</i> in the mail
in which I assert ``UConn (a 5 seed) is the lowest seed with any
chance of reaching the Final Four".  Most years this is true.
Nobody on Earth would think two EIGHT seeds would reach the Final
Four.

<p>
I think I have to root for Wisconsin since my brother got his
Ph.D. there, and I've always been fond of Bucky the Badger.  Also,
I have to root against UNC based on general principles (it's
just like rooting against Notre Dame football.)  And if MSU faces
Florida in the Final, I'd have to root for MSU just since I picked
them.
I have a couple German sports networks which carry, among other
things, NBA games from time time.  But no college hoops at all.
In another strange twist, I'm going to Japan next week (a week after
Sammy Sosa and Mike Piazza - too bad!)  Should be online, though.
I'll be at a CS conference.

Just loaded the espn.com page.  Too bad - Rutgers lost to the
Vols.  Not a huge surprise, but I really would have liked
a Huskies/Scarlet Knights final.  (One thing I particularly
like about UConn and Rutgers women's teams is that they
don't have that insipid ``Lady" as part of the name.  
Just what is a ``Lady Bulldog" anyway?)

<p>
Not only did the Oscars have Robin Williams singing ``Blame
Canada", complete with a chorus line of mounties who had incredible
legs, we were also treated to a snippet of ``Shaft", as sung by
Isaac Hayes, the voice of Chef!  Too bad Trey Parker and Matt Stone
couldn't win the Oscar, though they did look, um, interesting in
their evening gowns.
<i>((Indeed, and Billy Crystal's opening was actually FUN!))</i>

<p>
(The German network RTL showed the Oscars on Monday.  I imagine it
was edited way down from the 4PLUS hours.  That's the way to see it.
No real big surprises, although I was pleased to see Matrix beat 
Star Wars for all the special effects awards.)

Everyone will note that I predicted THAT one right and UConn nabbed
the title with our heroine, Shea Ralph, winning the Tournament
MVP award!!
With everyone back next year, repeating is going to be a matter
of avoiding boredom.
With men's basketball devolving into a mess of nastiness, 
the women really are a breath of fresh air.
They play real team basketball and none of those head cases.

I  just read a review of the new Mekons album ``Journey to the End of the
Night" in Rolling Stone-they gave it 3-1/2 stars and mention the
``melancholy electric ballads, languid reggae," and ``Langford and
Greenhalgh's  troll-like somber picaros through an inky world limned by
Suzie Honeyman's violin and Sally Timms' lilting vibrato."  Sounds like
they're coming to their senses making songs I like again-the Mekons'
last album I liked was <i>Retreat From Memphis</i>.  I think I'll order it.

Things have been more than a little crazy. More news next time. Lots of
stuff going on. I understand you'll be voting against Bush because he makes
your skin crawl. I guess I'll be voting against Gore for about the same
reason. Seems that's the state of Democracy in America... everyone voting
for whoever they despise the least. Ah well...

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>I have no regular Diplomacy game openings, but am actively recruiting
players for Mark Kinney so he can get his szine restarted.
To assist him, I have agreed to join his game.  
See the note in the Dip Hobby section above.

<p>
Also, from Eric Ozog:
``What do you say to me running Bernie Oaklyn's Air-Sea Diplomacy variant
as a subzine in <i>TAP</i>? The Maricopa game is going to wind up pretty soon,
and I'd still like to GM. I fit the profile: I'm a `not as young as I
used to be somewhat old-timer burned-out dip-deadwood daddy,' so GMing a
single game (preferably variant) in an orphanage zine (like <i>TAP</i>) of HOFs
(Hobby Old Farts) seems to be the fashionable thing to do these days.  It
might help forestall alzheimer's, if anything.  If you remember, Air-Sea
is the variant Uncle Bernie designed, based on the standard map except it
adds airplanes and submarines.  Maybe even Bernie would play.  I just
need to clean up the rules a little bit and would like to run it as an
email game, and you can print it in your zine.  You can make the
announcement in the next issue of <i>TAP</i> if you'd like, and shortly I'll
edit the rules and send them to you for publication.  What do you think?''
GO FOR IT, ERIC.
You know that as one of my originals, you only have to ask.
Send requests to join this game either to me or to Eric.
Eric is probably not going to start this quickly, but write to him
when you feel like it anyway.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has stepped out of the sixth spot,
so we now need THREE more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've forgotten just this instant
who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need four players.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming.

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.  
If you are interested, contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p>
1) Note Sean O'Donnell's new address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(LONDON, JUNE 22, 1902) First Sea Lord of the 
Admiralty, Samuel Owen Barfer (S.O.B.), was apoplectic. ``How dare those 
blasted Germans sally forth into the North Sea!" ``Tut, tut, Samuel" 
replied Second Sea Lord Fisher, ``Apparently it was a case of bad 
seamanship. Their battleship `Schleicher' was not showing any running 
lights nor would it give way to HMS `Immovable' which was on the 
German's starboard bow." ``Damned German landlubbers!  Those buggers 
shouldn't be allowed to put to sea!" bellowed Barfer.   

<p>
(VIENNA): The press corp went back to the days of World War II and recalled
the words of President Roosevelt, when he said of Italy when it went to war
in favor of Germany: ``The hand that held the dagger has stabbed it's
neighbor in the back." The reason for this failed attack has been lost, why
would Italy open a war front where peace had prevailed. The Austrians have
held the Italian ambassador for war crimes, since he lied about an attack
even after it had been launched. For this the press corp had to reveal the
days of World War Two when the Jap Ambassador assured the USA of peace even
after an attack had been sent against Pearl Harbor!

<p>
(LONDON, AUG 1, 1902) Prime Minister John Beale addressed Parliament, ``Let all 
nations beware the perfidy of Italy. Not only does Italy blatantly 
attack the Austro-Hungarian empire but Italy also maligns England's 
dignity by spreading malicious and false propaganda. Furthermore, I 
would ask `Who is next on Italy's list?'.''

<p>
(DATELINE: BERLIN):
I was in Guatemala several times during the civil war
and had no problems connected with any hostilities. It
is hard for me to imagine the friendly and enuncuative
Guatemalan people causing more
violence than we are accustomed to as Americans.
I think I need a vacation. I suppose the Sunday trip
to Greece will do very well.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note Sean O'Donnell's new address.

<p>
2) I had some questions about adjudications last time, but I double
checked them and they were all correct.  You have to watch all of
those cut supports.
Lots of units, very tricky.....

<p>
3) Note that Terry Gamble has to resign as he is being called into 
mail limited duty.
Hank Alme replaces him.
See Hank's press below.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MOSCOW to ISTANBUL): Did you enjoy your stay in Romania?  Can you 
count on Austrian help each year to return there?  
Is the Blk Sea an adequate compensation for losing Rom?

<p>
(FRANCE - ALL): I'm out of the country until 18 April. Mainly UK, but
I'll be making a side trip to Paris to see my new dominion.

<p>
1) Wow, lots of centers change hands.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TSAR KRISTOF - EUROPEAN HEADS OF STATE): We Russians are truly a peaceful people.
Really.....

<p>
(STRAY THOUGHT): Why is it lately when I tell somebody I 
am not attacking them they are not believing me?

<p>
(RUSSIA - AUSTRIA, ITALY, TURKEY): Man, them Balkans is one seriously screwed
up corner of the board!
I'm glad I'm not all up in that mess....
<i>((It is going to look a whole lot simpler after these Winter adjustments,
I think....))</i>

<p>
(F-E MAO): Are you stupid or what? I ask ``or what" because Italians always
give you a choice when they ask the question. At least the ones in
Providence.
I think you are listening to the Fascist Italian dictator.
        
<p>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY): **See Previous**

<p>
(TRENT-BURGESS): I broke down and bought my own copy of Colonial Diplomacy.
I'm a weak man.
Would you please stick me on your standby list for this game?
Vielen Dank.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note the correction to Jody's E-Mail address..... oh well, are the
addresses for the rest of you correct?
Every time I ask, Heath keeps assuring me that he is playing, but his
``playing dead'' strategy is working a bit too well.

<p>
2) I also came up with a new way of noting where units are annihilated
from in Spring.  I will capitalize ONLY the first letter of the space
where the unit ends up for the ones that are annihilated.

<p>
3) Back up to 16 centers annihilated, but also 16 units moving around
in the fall to take the other 18 centers.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENG -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> GER AND ITA): This is <i>not</i> good.
I have to split my focus and <i>everyone</i> knows I can't walk
and chew gum!

<p>
(MB to RW): When the bombs go off, your snowballs will melt.  This may
reduce your effective deliverable megatonnage.

<p>
(SARA-ALL): Just taking care of Heath Gardner to make sure he doesn't get any 
SCs for his NMRs.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) More press, more press, more press!!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(F to WORLD): ALL TOGETHOR NOW!
``Can't tell a hero by his size,
He's just a tiny little super guy!
OHHHHH yeah!"
<i>((Oh yeah, oh yeah.... and this press really blows me away
with its wackiness and range.
You're all just tiny little super guy heroes....))</i>

<p>
(MIKE B to R ELLIS):  The only person I've heard ``dismiss" Kent and Doc
as ``raw rookies" is you.  I didn't find your press either funny, or
polite, or accurate in ascribing such opinions to me.  MUST I SLAP YOU
UPSIDE THE HEAD, BOY?!  You know I have this 23-year stretch of
nonviolence I don't want to end.
<i>((Well, except for Randy, who is just an interloper anyway!))</i>

<p>
(F to G): Mein fuhrer, I CAN WALK!!!!!!
<i>((But can you write, that is the question!))</i>

<p>
(I to R): Ruble for your thoughts...

<p>
(RUSSIA to ITALY): You bastard! This could have
been done so easily. Now I will make your life a
living hell! Doubt me? Just ask Terry!

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): Well, there you are, did you get your money's worth?
Remember that this is BEFORE the hyperinflations when a ruble 
was really paying top dollar!
Now for something that is decidedly NOT worth top dollar....

<p>
(FLASHY to MORRIS): I called my ``Psychic Friends" last night and they said 
your Tarot Cards looked promising, but perhaps misguided a little. The 3 of 
SWORDS means you are to crush Germany and help your buddy Italy, not ``stab 
Italy." My cards said I would be firing blanks at an ``Old Barn Door," 
whatever that means...

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE AND RUSSIA): It was all France's idea, why I listened I
will never know.  I guess it was the promise of rebates.

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): Just be glad you weren't promised a rebate by England!
What do you think he has to say to YOU??
Nothing.... just this....

<p>
(ENGLAND to ALL): France has offered to get you all off my back and to assist
me back into the homeland.  I stated that my only reservation was that I was
not going to go through all that just so he could take a solo.  The silence
since then has been deafening.  If there is anyone in charge of the ``Crush
France Like A Deranged Bug" movement let me know.  I am willing to turn the
fleets about in such a worthy cause.

<p>
(PALACE OF DISBAND AND FLEE):  Gee, as soon as the ``attack whoever
doesn't write" players stabbed me, they stopped writing.  Guess I'll
reduce respect levels a point.

<p>
(BOOB to RESPECT FANS): Let's have another song, another song....

<p>
(F to T): We've got a half of tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes and two 
hours till Austria hits the beach!  Nice job by the way with that mass 
mailer.  Solid tactic.  YOU DA MAN!  Gimmie a B, gimmie an A, gimmie a R, 
gimmie a N, gimmie an O, WHAT'S THAT SPELL?  BARNOOOOOOOOO!

<p>
(GERMANY to FRANCE): That is just about enough of that Scott.
<i>((Great Scott!  Speaking of a Scott....))</i>

<p>
(MUNSON to BARNO): Sorry old bean, but the winds have changed. It must be 
toxic gases from Mammoth or Fresno or something...

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): Those greasy wax seals really play havoc with the rest
of the mail.

<p>
(BOOB to ENGLAND): And then there's this next one which is sick, sic, and
just plain sick!
All bad puns and possible spelling errors are, well, just what he
means to say.

<p>
(HUEY STRONG, AMERICAN REPORTING ABROAD): A rare pubic appearance was made 
today by the newly appointed pontiff, Pope Jizmo ``Speedicut" Varone, who, 
upon request of the Austrian Ambassador Pollard, conducted a blessing of the 
war-torn fields of Bulgaria. In what can only be described as a vulgar 
display of drunken stupidity, Pope Verone, fresh from the ``booze cruise" 
that landed him, commenced ``blessing" Turkish casualties by urinating on 
them and swatting at them with what turned out to be an olive branch. The 
fact that many of the Turkish casualties weren't quite dead yet did nothing 
to help matters. With tension and anger growing, the Pope then tried to make 
amends by pinching the backside of a wounded Turkish Commander while 
whispering something in his ear. The ensuing ruckus left his Holiness 
unconscious in a pile of his own feces.
    
<p>
A drunken Harry Flashman, Fresh from the same ``booze cruise" as the 
Pope, said, and I quote, ``I told the Bloody git to go to the bathroom before 
we landed." He was also hear to say he was thankful to be out of the Italian 
navy and back on land with the Austrian 15th Lancers. It's no wonder.

<p>
(SOMEWHERE IN VIENNA...): ``PSSST!" Eyes darting back and forth, the Austrian 
Ambassador Kent Pollard smiles devilishly as he opens the industrial 
strength can of `WHUP-ASS.'
     
<p>
``Guaranteed to rid you of those pesky European problems! Now in new 
`Ottoman Strength!' Kill a Turk in nothing flat!"

<p>
DIRECTIONS: Sprinkle around Black Sea basin and wait approximately 1 to 
2 years for your Italian Pest control supervisor to arrive.

<p>
(BOOB to AUSTRIA): And there can ONLY be one response to THAT!

<p>
(F to A): Ve vill attempt to fuvill ze vishes of ze committee on immigration.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE POWERS ZAT BE):
Ve are vatching and vaiting zou all.
At present I must inspect za region of Bulgaria and greet za Holy Pope...
I vill write to you Herr. Morris immediately 
and za High Command is quite interested in za proposed Diplomatic plans.....

<p>
(F to GM): So, going to Baltimore eh?  Have you ever played junta?  It's a 
pretty funny game.  I just ordered a copy from Castle Perilous.
<i>((No, actually I haven't!))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) All quiet... except for some more press.
And also, apologies for getting Italy's army in the wrong place on the
map last time.
The unit report was correct as it usually is.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOZ to DREW): Whaddya mean there are no worthwhile sports until next fall?
You've got auto racing from now through October!!!

<p>
(OZOG - RUSNAK AND RAUTERBERG): I couldn't decide who to
stab so I figured I'd get you both. What can I say?
You can't always trust an Ozog (both of you know this
from dealing with Eric over the years.) 

<p>
(PAUL to RUSS): Have we been dumped, or just dumped upon?

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Tsk, tsk.  Jim-Bob, you've let your loyalties blind you
(again) to the obvious.  Tell you what, so you have something to poke fun
at, here are my fearless predictions for MLB 2k.  Take your best shot, and
then let's pull it all back out in October.

<p>
AL East: Everyone says that Boston is finally ready to dethrone the
Yankees.  Wrong.  Boston will likely get the wild-card slot though, but
they'll have to beat out Toronto and the Baltimore Underachievers (sorry,
redundant) to do it.
<i>((Me, I think it is too early to tell, I honestly suspect the
Yankees will still win, but I'll be rootin' for my Sox!))</i>

<p>
AL Central:  To be renamed ``The Indians and the 4 dwarves".  No contest.
Only 1 team over .500.
<i>((Wrong! 
I think that Chicago and Kansas City will make serious runs this year,
for the Wild Card if nothing else.
It will not be easy for Cleveland, though they'll probably win.))</i>

<p>
AL West:  Everyone says that Seattle is better *because* they sent Griffey
to Cincinnati.  I think everyone has inhaled too much dust from the Kingdome
implosion.  Texas again.  Seattle and Anaheim fight for 2nd.
<i>((And Oakland sinks back into the muck?
I don't think so.
This will be a very tight race throughout.
My best guess is that Seattle will indeed win it.
They have a bullpen for the FIRST time in history.))</i>

<p>
NL East:  Here the Mets may actually dethrone the Braves.  They both make
the playoffs though, one as the Wild Card.  But I'm still picking Atlanta
for the division, Smoltz or no.

<p>
NL Central:  This might be the most interesting race in MLB, even though no
one will win 90 games.  Look for St. Louis to win a tight 3-way race with
Cincinnati and Houston.  The only interesting thing about the Cubs is
whether they have more wins than Sosa has home runs.  I'm betting `yes', but
I'm not betting much.

<p>
NL West:  Will the Dodgers finally live up to their potential and their
payroll?  Not quite.  Arizona takes the title.
<i>((I really like the Giants and their chances, but you have the rest
of the NL sized up about right.))</i>

<p>
World Series:  Yankees beat Arizona, 4-1.  Ya heard it here first.  Oh yeah,
all 8 playoff teams will be in the top 12 in payroll.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Dave Partridge asks: ``I know we can go back and figure it out, 
but it'd be nice to print the card the rider used this turn 
(maybe in () right after the name?).  
It helps get a feel for what the other player is thinking.''
Sounds like a good idea, let's do it!
I'll put it at the end of each player's card holding line in parentheses.

<p>
2) John did not get orders in, but I heard that he had some really 
exciting potential news coming up that I hope I can tell you more about
next time.
He did not get orders in here.
Technically, all his riders should play their lowest cards by rule, but I
gave Chasin' Jason a break and played a five for him.
If you guys complain, tough noogies, it's a GM decision! ;-)
Consider the 4 15's a present from me and next time I hope to be able
to tell you why he deserves them.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WHITE RABBIT): I'm late, I'm late, I'm late ...

<p>
(MAD HATTER - MATTY): Oooooohhh....!  Road Apples!  Darrel!  Catch!

<p>
(MAD HATTER - MARCH HARE): Hey!  You could burn more speed than that! 
You holding back on us?

<p>
(CHANCES ARE):  Isaac plays the 8.

<p>
(ALICE - MOCK TURTLE):  You got that right!  I want to see you after the

<p>
(AMATEURS - OTHERS):  Heh!  Beginners luck...

<p>
(ALICE - MANIACS):  You'll get your chance...  I don't wanna see you
trailing the pack at the end of Snell, either!

<p>
(MARCH HARE - CHEF):  I saw him sneaking into your kitchen with a satchel
of the stuff, and he didn't have it when he came out.  What have you
been unknowingly feeding your diners, hmmmm?

<p>
(MAD HATTER - CHEF):  Mercury?  Isn't he the one with wings on his tail? 
No, ... that's not right...  Wings on his ... shoulders.  Wait, that's
the horsey critter!  Wings on the brain?  Err...  That's a Hatter's
delusion.  Wings on the  feet?  Maybe you're in the wrong game.  Ever
hear of Snell?

<p>
(DISGRUNTLED POSTAL WORKER-ERIC): The Postal waffle about Priority Mail that 
might get there in two days is nothing.  Good ol' USPS trashed Special 
Delivery to boost Express Mail and eliminate jobs for the Special Delivery 
workers.   

<p>
(FROM JOHN HARRINGTON ON THE MEKONS):
I had saved a newspaper article on the Dan Dare comic strip for you with a 
view to posting it, as it explained the origin of the name of the eponymous 
band.  However in this electronic age it is probably easier to point you in 
the direction of a couple of web sites:

<p>
http://home.t-online.de/home/Norbert.Knape/mek_name.htm

<p>
http://members.aol.com/nicholashl/homepage.htm

<p>
Probably more than you wanted to know about some obscure 1950's British comic 
book; they really don't make 'em like this anymore.

<p>
(BERLIN to BRITAIN): Yeah John, nice ally you have there in Spain.  He
urges me to attack you, and then he makes a deal that if I ever do 
(invade) he'll be your friend and buddy.  Um, and he kicks you out of 
your Por/Bor dots, too....  What a guy!

<p>
(SPAIN-GM AND BOARD): I'm back and I know that you were all hoping I wouldn't be.

<p>
1) The FRT draw is rejected as the Eric Cartman vote is disallowed

The concession to Chef fails just on general principles
since there is no press.
