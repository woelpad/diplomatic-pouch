Howdy Friends,

The following article, by my friend Ig Lew, deserves a wide distribution. Ig 
is the most cogent political writer I've ever encountered. If this isn't your 
cup of tea, feel free to just skip it.  On the other hand, if you'd like to 
see more of Ig's superb writing (on topics ranging from politics to Ig's life to 
books to history to Ig's favorite baseball team (the Oakland A's) to 
etymology; check out Ig's blog Benzene (<A 
HREF="http://radio.weblogs.com/0134204/#start">Benzene 4</A>) (http://radio.weblogs.com/0134204/index.html), which I 
*highly* recommend.

I am sending this out with Ig's permission.  (The "RMO" in his second and 
third paragraphs refers to a Usenet newsgroup.)  Oh, and if you do check out 
Benzene, tell him I sent you!

What We Should Learn From the Failure of the Bush Presidency

by Ig Lew

That's an ambitious title. For almost a year now I've had it in mind to write 
an article that lives up to it. There's a lot that's wrong with the Bush 
presidency, but I've been frustrated by the shallow analysis by many Bush critics 
(mostly Democrats, but not entirely) that boils the whole thing down to, "Bush 
is bad, so we should replace him with someone good." There's an important 
article to be written rebutting that view.

What follows is not that article. Realistically, I'm never going to get 
around to writing it. I did, however respond to a post in RMO one rare day when I 
had some free time, and some of the related ideas came out. After about five 
paragraphs I realized RMO wasn't the place for it, so instead of posting, I 
saved it for Benzene instead.

The context isn't important. One of RMO's resident liberals mentioned that 
she's looking forward to the end of Bush's presidential term, and along the way 
referred to that as "a change in regime". 

Regime change doesn't solve the problem. The Bush presidency has been 
damaging to the country not because Bush is incompetent (we've had incompetent 
presidents before), nor because he's evil or malicious (which I don't believe he 
is), nor even because he has political goals that you or I disagree with (we've 
had plenty of that before, too).

We've survived plenty of bad presidencies before. The reason this one 
threatens to do lasting damage is because of structural damage to our political 
system. The United States has a long record of social, economic, and military 
success in large part due to our excellent form of government. Crucial to that 
success is the various correcting mechanisms built into the system. In addition to 
the celebrated checks and balances between our three branches of government, 
there is the balance that comes from reconciling the two sides in our 
two-party system. Most important of all there is the matter of accountability, 
ultimately to the electorate.

All of these are now severely damaged, in many cases deliberately damaged by 
the Bush regime. Power is dangerously concentrated in the executive branch 
now. Current lack of congressional oversight is unprecedented in our history. 
Even when Congress is inclined to participate in government it is crippled by 
lack of good information. The executive branch controls information, and it 
manipulates policymaking by selectively withholding it, distorting it, or in some 
cases even fabricating it. The judicial branch is similarly shut out, with any 
court that disagrees with executive power branded as "activist". Legislation 
is increasingly ineffective, as the executive department declines to enforce 
laws it doesn't like and fails to implement congressionally mandated government 
initiatives. Recently, the executive repertoire has expanded to redefining 
Congress's laws to mean something other than what Congress explicitly intended.

Partisan power has become dangerously unbalanced as well. Traditions and 
procedures in American government had evolved so that a certain amount of 
bipartisan support was necessary for major decisions. The corrosion of rules in 
Congress began before 2000, but it has grown considerably worse during the Bush 
presidency. Everything we learned in high school civics class about how laws are 
made is obsolete now. Sometimes members of Congress aren't even given an 
opportunity to read the laws they vote on, much less participate in writing them.

Worst of all is the loss of accountability. The greatest strength of our 
political system was the way in which successful policy would drive out 
unsuccessful policy. With the political equivalent of Adam Smith's "invisible hand", 
those policies and their implementors who succeeded in providing the electorate 
what it wanted would be rewarded while those that failed would not. In a 
healthy administration, the same dynamic occurs within the government as well. When 
a department's program is successful, it is emulated. When a department fails, 
the person responsible is sacked and someone else is given a chance. Even if 
it isn't that person's "fault" per se, it's still part of the process that 
assures that good ideas rise to the top.

What worries me about Bush's detractors is the naive belief that simply 
removing Bush will solve these problems — that Bush fails simply because he's a bad 
president and if we replace him with a good president, all will be well. It 
won't. Without repair of our political system, the next president — whether 
Democrat or Republican — will be just as ineffective.

For all our squabbling about hot-button ideological issues, there really 
isn't that much distance between what Democrats and Republicans want. We all want 
economic prosperity, protection from terrorism, disengagement from Iraq 
without the Middle East exploding into a messy war, etc. The disagreement is about 
the best strategy for achieving these goals. Of course these are all difficult 
questions. If they weren't, there wouldn't be the heated debates. We're all 
just taking our best guesses, and no one really knows the answers. If someone 
did know — and again, this is the genius of our (now damaged) political system 
— that answer would be embraced. If someone stumbled on a plan that really 
did, say, bring peace to the Middle East, we wouldn't continue to bicker about 
it. We would say, "Hey, that really works; by all means let's do it." At worst, 
each party would grab the idea and claim it as its own, but either way it 
would get done.

Bush's detractors seem to think that he fails simply because he's dumb and 
has the wrong ideas and we just need to put in someone else who's smart and has 
the right ideas. Of course, Bush doesn't know all the answers. No one does. 
Our system of government does not require the president to have all the answers, 
and that's exactly why America has proved more successful in almost every way 
than totalitarian states like the Soviet Union.

The reason Bush has failed so spectactularly is that he has destroyed the 
mechanisms whereby good ideas rise to the top. There is no accountability 
anywhere in the administration, all dissenting views are vigorously squelched, and 
all information is kept as confidential as possible. The result is that when 
someone is about to do something stupid — as will inevitably happen — there is 
nothing there to correct the error, either before or after the fact. If some 
piece of our government policy is terribly misguided, there might well be a 
whole lot of people out there who would recognize the problem, but they probably 
don't get a chance to see what's going on, or if they do see it they aren't 
listened to. Once the bad policy is in place, it stays in place — possibly 
because the ill effects are kept hidden, but even after a department head 
accumulates a six-year record of bad results, he's still allowed to continue, because 
this administration values loyalty over competence.

When thinking about who to elect as president in 2008, voters — both Democrat 
and Republican — who are appalled by the breathtaking failure of the Bush 
presidency should not be thinking about which candidate, or which party, has the 
right policies and the right ideas. What we need to be considering is which 
candidate (or party) is committed to repairing a political system which brings 
good policies to the top regardless of who suggested them. Given that the 
damage to the system was done primarily as a means of pursuing power, both to the 
party and to the executive, undoing the damage is going to require a president 
willing to let go of a lot of power. What we emphatically do not need is an 
anti-Bush whose attitude is, "The other guys had their chance to do whatever 
they want without restraint; now it's our turn."

I assume you're talking about the same one Brux just forwarded to his 
mass-email group, right?  The one titled "what we should learn about 
the Bush presidency", or something like that.

That would be fine. I'm very interested in what you'd have to say about 
the general idea of the free market metaphor as it applies to 
decision-making within a bureaucracy.  There was some of that in John 
Kay's recent book (I forget the title, but you probably know it: 
something very Adam Smith-like), and I found it very inspiring.  But 
rereading my article lately, I didn't really pursue that as much as I 
would have liked.

I think the accountability of bureaucrats within the system is the 
larger problem than general accountability of office-holders to the 
electorate, but it reads like I'm emphasizing the latter more.  Maybe 
I'll follow up on that in the context of the "Richard Clarke was/wasn't 
fired" debate.

P.S.  I've moved so much lately that I don't know what address you've 
got, but I'm pretty sure it's wrong.  As of August 2006 I'm at:  1844 N 
190th Street, Shoreline, WA 98133
