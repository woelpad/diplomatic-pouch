Jim,
          I just received TAP # 309 in the mail today, Mar 13th. It was 
a surprise to me that it arrived after the deadline. The only player who 
has contacted me was Rauterberg  so I knew the zine was on its way. 
Anyway, here are my builds;
                  Build A Ank & F Smy.
 Press: Constantinople (Dec 31, 1905)  Sultan Hatas I surveyed the 
latest military reports then mumbled out loud, " The Czar is a madman -
