Hi, Jim
I saw that you were looking for players for a game of Regular Diplomacy. =
 I
would like to join that if I can.  As you said before (its been a =
while), it
costs $20 for a life of game sub/play fee.  I have been in another
face-to-face game since I started as a stand by.  I don't know how I'd =
do
but would like to give it a shot and will get the payment to you as soon =
as
you need.
=20
                From,
                Shaun Thompson
