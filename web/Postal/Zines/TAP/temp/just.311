Alas, since experiencing a partial meltdown early this millennium, I have  
been unable to travel more than about 33 miles from home.  If it ever comes  to 
central Oklahoma, you can count on me, if my new-found crowd-aversion doesn't  
grab me by the throat.

By the way Eric/Jeff
the World DipCon Championships are in Vancouver this year in august,
would be a hoot to have you two come up there and donate a pint or  
two of blood.

We did have numbered armies and fleets, which simplified order writing  
somewhat, but the rule about not bringing a destroyed unit back in was not  our 
rule.  We did some things strangely, but not that  strange.  We were the only 
game I know of to have had the gamesmaster  playing in it.  That was for two 
reasons: first of all I wanted to  play which was why I started the game; and 
second, because I barely knew six  other players at the time, let alone seven!
