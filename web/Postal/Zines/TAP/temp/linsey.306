Just happened to notice the remarks about your brother playing in a game that 
you're GMing.  (See? I DO look through the zine now and then!)

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, since there's no deception 
involved.  I've run games and fantasy sports leagues in which my wife, brother, and 
cousin have played for many years, and I've never even had a complaint of 
favoritism.  (Not even in 1999, when my wife Krissi had a perfect season and was 
the #1 team in all of Gonzo Football!)  Really, a relative is no different in 
this respect than a close friend, and many of us in the postal gaming 
community have plenty of friends playing in our games.

I wouldn't hesitate to join one of your games which also included your 
relatives.  Just my two cents worth.

Bruce

this won't be a problem.  Thank you.
