Press:

England to Europe:  The English people are disturbed at the rumors of 
war coming from the continent.  It is hard to believe that any leader 
would send his people off to war over something as insignificant as 
control of so called "black dots".  The peace loving people of Britain 
will stay aloof from any conflict (unless dragged in to protect vital 
national interests of course...)

England to France:  Spies on the continent picked up many indications 
of a move into the Channel.  This move is defensive - simply the Royal 
Navy on exercises.

James Family to Jeff in Ohio:  The METS! METS! Always the METS! We 
won't even use the "Y" word in this family.

Syracuse to World:  Is it basketball season yet?  Doesn't it seem like 
the college football season has been going on forever...or is that 
just in Syracuse?
