All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
And I think they all appear in this issue, with the possible exception of 
<i>Tinamou</i>, I'm waiting for it as I speak and wrap up last minute bits.
If <i>Tinamou</i> is NOT enclosed, then David will send it out by E-Mail/Web
in short order and it will appear in #258, with the next issue still in #259.
The deadline for that next <i>Tinamou</i> will be May 12th.
We also have Jim and Buddy Tretick doing a ``demo game'' of Air-Sea Diplomacy
starting in this issue.
We're trying to generate interest for a real game. 
Who is going to GM it, not me....

<p>
<br /><br />This issue's lateness is attributed to the IRS and Jay Furr, in equal proportions.
David Partridge and I, in particular, were slowed by taxation issues, and then
there was the vision of Jay Furr..... Jay is presently somewhere in Boston,
but he has gone silent.
Tonight (April 15), Mel Nicholson and I organized a get-together of Diplomacy,
food, and alcoholic libation with said Mr.&nbsp;Furr and he STOOD US UP!!!
Leaving us with six instead of seven, and forced to play ``random Italy'',
with everyone submitting Italian orders with a random set selected and played.
I drew France and parlayed English and German mistakes, plus the random Italian,
into a French win.
BUT, it still did NOT assuage the pall of Jay Furr.
Jay is a famous Internet character, with his own web site at www.furrs.org
that salutes his infamousness on Usenet.
In his FAQ, he answers the question:
``Does Joel spend all his time logged in, or what?''
With: 
``No. Despite the insults from losers who, when losing an argument in 
a Usenet newsgroup, say `Hey, get out from in front of your monitor 
once in a while, bub!' Joel actually spends little time logged in.''
But he does spend time standing up Jim-Bob Burgess, Mel ``Pox" Nicholson,
and assorted other Bostonite Diplomacy players.
Since, when Mel and I drove to Doug Massey's house in Vermont, Joel
showed up to say hi for all of TWO minutes and then left (admittedly
when we found we had eight to play Dip and he wasn't ``needed'', but 
still!!!) suffice it to say I am developing a complex. 
And all of you bear the cost of ONE more day without seeing <i>TAP</i>.
Send Joel E-Mail at jay of furrs.org if you want to complain....
by the way, we called him repeatedly on his cell phone and I called
and left a message in the hotel room where he was staying and he still
did not respond or send regrets....
this makes me realize that I did NOT describe in detail EITHER the
recent two board strong Diplomatic Incident held in Boston or the
Vermont get-together at Doug Massey's house here in <i>TAP</i>...
in the interest of not holding up the publication of <i>TAP</i>
yet FURTHER, let me pass on doing so here, perhaps next time.
Get out and play FTF, now!!
VERY LATE update, Jay seems to be having a very painful problem
with TMJ, an occupational hazard for us mouthy diplomats.
Get well soon, Jay, but we'll be watchin' for a new opportunity
for you to ditch us!
But soft pedal those complaints if you send any.

<p>
<br /><br />
<p>
Deadlines are still held as even, despite this being a bit late.
Get yo butts in gear and get orders in!!!  ;-)  ;-)  ;-)
I did nail the choice of Maryland to win the Men's NCAA Tournament
and UConn to win the Women's NCAA Tournament, a first for me!
Cheer quietly.
And watch for Nicole Wolff, who will become my next favorite 
UConn women's basketball player.
Four great seniors graduate and a bunch of great players come in
as replacements.
I forget the other woman's name who actually is winning all the National
High School Player of the Year awards, but Nicole is my favorite already.
Duke lost on a free throw, just as I predicted, on the Men's side.
Yay!
Practice your free throws, baby....

<p>
<br /><br />The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!
When the Postal rate increase goes into effect, I'm probably
going to raise that to two bucks, so get renewals in now!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My Red Sox team is looking great for next year and so I'm very excited.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW NEW PLAYERS!!
Contact John Caruso at commishjohn of att.net or me for more details.
We have just one team left open at the moment.
LATE WORD: that might be taken....
Don't be left out.
Exhibition baseball play has started and then I'll get a chance
to see if I really have put together a contender.

Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hearby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a ``whenever''.
In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 
I think we really DO have Rip Gooch as the representative volunteer, more forthcoming
on that.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR TOM HURST</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Wake up, you pile of useless deadwood!!!
STILL nothing on Tom yet.
Let's go, someone find him!!!
Our Tom Hurst is NOT the drummer for House of Dreams, a pithy
interesting band that I checked out while doing a bit of looking
for Tom, but a Google search brought me 1,340 hits, many of them
regarding Tom's excellent Diplomacy writing, but unlikely to help
you find him directly.
Do I have to RAISE the compensation to get you all to look?

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Bill, Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Bill Quinn or Mark Berch or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page,

What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

This year a large number of
players went on to Round 2, before they narrowed to the Semi-Final Round
of Seven games to determine who goes to the Finals.
The semi-final games are finishing up now.
Likely finalists include: 
Jack Brawner (best known as Dick Martin's childhood pal), 
David Wreathall, Douglas Vaughan, Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu, and Darren Koch; if
I am reading things right. 

<p>
Right now, many of you should be able to access Ray Setzer's newsgroup

I think Egg also has a place in the finals, but I can't quite tell yet.
We concluded that game with a gentleman's draw with 
Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu in the supply center count lead and Joe also
topped the board as Russia in his semi-final game.
Believe it or not, Egg and I DID ally for the last year of the game!
If Joe, Jack, and Egg really are all in the finals, that will be

<br /><br /> <b>Rick Desper (Sat, 6 Apr 2002 18:35:08 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
Saw ``Big Trouble" last night.  I enjoyed it, but I had this problem: the book
was much funnier.  The movie suffered a bit from having too much to try to
fit in.  Plus, it's very hard to see a movie after reading a book.  Esp.
a comedy.  I would be interested to hear a review from somebody who hadn't
read the book, but saw the movie.  And perhaps read the book later.  Maybe
it's just whichever you do first?

<p>
Hmm...actually, I think it's better to see the movie first.  I still enjoyed
reading ``Get Shorty" after seeing the movie.  The studio is trying to play
up this movie as a Get Shorty-ish thing, but I don't think it's quite there.
But the funniest thing about the movie is how it was supposed to be released
in early October of last year, but it was delayed because it made light of
airport security and included a plane hijacking.  Amazing prescience on the
part of Dave Barry - he also included a lot of action including a pair of
FBI agents (played by Heavy D and Omar Epps in the film) acting under the 
authority of Special Executive Order 768-04.  

<p>
Who knew, when the book was written, that Bush would have such a fetish
for writing executive orders?  In today's world, it is not hard at all to
imagine a Special Executive Order 768-04.

<p>
Recent rentals:

<p>
AI: The problem with a movie about artificial life is that you are torn
between making the robot too lifelike, in which case you have to face the
criticism that you are unrealistic (best example: Data on Star Trek) or
you make the robot very realistic, in which case the character can be
uninteresting.  Spielberg tries to walk a tightrope between the two pits,
and succeeds for the first hour, when ``David" is trying to fit in with his
adoptive family.  Unfortunately, that's about the only part of the movie worth
watching.  The next hour I felt like clonking Haley Joel Osmond's character
on the head.  Seems like he represented not ``Artificial Intelligence" but
``Artificial Melodrama".  And the ending was truly awful: the Deus ex Machina
twist is beyond even the realm of sappiness which I typically expect from
a Spielberg film.  I really think no film could possibly have a worse
ending than AI.  They needed to simply clip out the last 20 minutes and
pretend it never happened.

<p>
Training Day: finally saw this.  Denzel's Alonzo Harris is a well-drawn 
character, and I definitely think he deserved his recent Oscar.  However, this
movie reminded me a bit of ``Scent of a Woman", where you have one 
excellently-drawn character stuck in a movie which cannot really support him.
I was a bit disappointed to discover the big plot twist which involved Alonzo
needing to raise a lot of cash to avoid getting snuffed out by the Russian
mafia.  I think this could have been a great film if they'd simply contended
themselves with police corruption.  It could have been a modern ``Touch of Evil",
which leaves you wondering whether Alonzo is actually right about everything,
and whether Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke) is simply a naive rookie.  A 
little more tension there would have been good, but they simply settled
upon a black-and-white ending (no racial pun intended).

<p>
TV:
the best of the past season has been ``24" on Fox, though I'm starting to get
a bit tired with the writing.  Kiefer is very good, and the supporting cast
is solid, but I'm beginning to feel like it's hurt by some very subtle sexism.
Example: a female staffer of Senator Palmer, the Presidential candidate who is
the target of an assassination plot, has discovered that she's been having
an affair with an assassin who has been using her to get close to the Senator.
She volunteers to wear a wire and plant a tracker in his wallet, but then she
decides to abort this plan.  Why?  Because the assassin starts talking about
how ``he's really falling in love with her".  Well, of course, because she's
a hysterical female, she goes nuts when she hears this, and decides to stab him 
to death.  Gotta love those hysterical females.  A staple of Hollywood.

<p>
I'm finding the Amazing Race to be more consistently interesting than Survivor
these days.  The Race has its flaws: it seems to all come down to who can
make the right connections in an airport, and who has the better taxi driver.
But Survivor has strayed far from what interests me: watching people survive,
and instead has become a bit of a self-important morality play.  Well, with
the current merge, things could become interesting.  Surely Rob from Boston
will tell Paschal, Kathy, and Neleh that John promised him that they would
vote off those three before the three original Maraamu three: Rob, Sean, and V.
This week's episode will tell us if the show has any hope of being interesting.
For once I'd like to see the game not be controlled at the 10-player stage
by a minority of the players.

<p>
<i>((Thanks, haven't seen Big Trouble yet, but didn't read the book, so I'll
let you know if I see it what I think.  Arrgh, I thought I submitted
my Survivor guesses, I would have put SOME points on Gina, though 
I really thought their team would win Immunity.  Nothing I hear or see
makes me really actually want to watch the show though.  But admittedly,
I watch very, very little TV.  I've caught a couple of minutes of 24
here and there.  I'd cut them some slack on the 24 idea.  They have
to ``go at warp speed" to keep the whole thing in one day.  Personally,
the parts of the show I saw in the middle of the night were ludicrous
at times (that person who visited the Senator really early in the
morning at his house??  No one would do that except really close friends.
Without seeing it, I'd put the ``hysterical reaction" in the same class.))</i>

<p>
My biggest problem with the show right now is that the big selling point 
was that the characters had been UP ALL NIGHT!  Nobody seems to be showing
any signs of this whatsoever (well, except of course the vulnerable female
characters).  I see no bleary eyes, no baggy cheeks, nothing!

<p>
Also - I just remembered that they just had a plot twist where there
was a car accident on Mulholland Drive and a major female character ended up 
with Amnesia.  I kid you not!  What next - a one-armed man kills Jack Bauer's
wife and frames him?

<p>
<i>((I think I commented extensively on AI when I first saw it in <b>TAP</b>.  You
might go back and look at those comments.  I completely agree with you
about that last part EXCEPT that was a crucial part of the original 
story.  My take is that Spielberg couldn't help but cheapen the ending
into stupidity, where Kubrick would NOT have.  Imagine the reverse,
Spielberg filming the last 20 minutes of 2001 a Space Odyssey and you'll
see what I mean.))</i>

<p>
Right - I just looked at your comments and I think I'm a bit more negative
than you are.  The movie really felt like it was trying to head toward a 2001-
type ending.  But it didn't make it.

<p>
This reminds me - I saw two previews for upcoming Disney movies.  They look
horrible!  There's some animated flick where the quality of the animation
looks like it was done in the 1950s.  And there's some insipid movie involving
an adopted bear.  Disney is really in the crapper these days.  Sigh - this
retro-nostalgia thing doesn't appeal to me at all.

<p>
<i>((If you don't have cable, and I don't, is there anything at all on TV?
I still watch Jay Leno a fair amount, I enjoy his monologues.  But that's
pretty close to it.  I liked Scrubs the first few times I saw it, but
that will get old fast.  But at least it feels fresh for now.  But
I'm usually too busy to watch anything regularly and the random moment
brings no benefit from watching much.  I did happen to see Andy
Richter's show and ***I*** liked it, though I expect everyone else
will hate it.))</i>

<p>
Unfortunately, Andy Richter's show goes up against CSI, I think.  
<i>((Forgive me if I say I've never heard of CSI.... whatever
that stands for...))</i>
I enjoy CSI more than most shows.  I don't really watch any ``Cable-only" shows
except for reruns on Comedy Central.  I have cable mostly so I can watch 
sports.  And old movies.

<p>
<i>((Lastly, didn't I send you a note prior to season start about Barry 
Bonds?  I did to a few people.  I was sure that he would have an even
better season this year and WILL lead the Giants strong into the 
playoffs.  I obviously saw nothing in Week 1 to dissuade me from
that notion.  The Red Sox, IMHO, will be fine, they won't beat
the Yankees but likely WILL take the Wild Card with 90-95 wins.
Their division just stinks TOO badly and the West is just TOO
strong top to bottom.
Here's my official picks..... Oakland in the AL West
(sorry, Seattle, but Oakland beats you out and Texas and Anaheim
will be tough enough to give you lots of losses), Cleveland in the
AL Central (sorry, Minnesota, but just a bit resource short),
and the Yankees in the AL East, with the Red Sox as the Wild Card.
In the NL, my Giants will streak!
And St. Louis will win the Central, Atlanta the East.  The Mets
will NOT make the playoffs, and I think Houston will edge out the
two pitchers and days of rain Arizona Diamondbacks for the Wild
Card!!
Giants into the World Series against.... well probably the Yankees.
Giants win to give Barry Bonds the World Series title that he REALLY
wants.
Red Sox wait 'til next year again.))</i>

<p>
You said the Giants would be hot, but nothing about Bonds in particular.
I cannot figure out what the story is with him.  Why is he peaking as a slugger
after the age of 36?  If only Jim Rice had done the same.  :(

<p>
<i>((I think that he is following in McGwire's footsteps on that.

Baseball is so corrupt it's hard for me to watch.  Forbes (or was it Fortune)
just posted an article which basically called the owners big liars about how
much money they were earning, and said that many more of them were making money
than they wanted to let out.  I see MLB as an institution which is in a state of
decay which will not end anytime soon.

Jim-Bob,
When did MLB start commencing on Sunday?  
<i>((To be honest, don't recall...))</i>
Not much new since last year.  A little tweaking here and there, 
but still no revenue sharing plan.  So I
pick the Yankees to win it all.  Again.  As for other items...

<p>
American League:  Yankees, Indians, Mariners.  Wild card may go to the
White Sox this year, but look for Texas to actually play up to their
salaries.  Toronto may also challenge.  Boston, now that Duquette is gone,
is finally healing.  Look for them to challenge by the next century.

<p>
National League:  Mets, Astros, Dodgers.  Look for the Braves to be better
than last year, but only make the wild card behind a much improved Shea
bunch.  Arizona figbts for the West, but falls short when the actuarial
tables catch up with them.  The Cubs and Cardinals may steal a weak Central,
but I'll pick Houston to win it now that they're clear of Enron.

<p>
Yankees over Mets in the WS.

<p>
Well, our so-called Major League Soccer got its season off to a great
start:  at least two ``own goals" on the first day of play!

<p>
<i>((Excuse me, what is this ``soccer".... the own goals I read about
occurred in football.  Was this the sport to which you were referring??))</i>

<p>
Uh, if they called it ``Major League Football" they would have confusion and
maybe legal hassles.  Had these events occurred in ``football" **by the
standards prevailing in the geographical and chronological setting of the
events**, they would have been ruled ``safeties", scoring two points each
for the opponents instead of just one.
Hell, if TV ratings and fan attendance don't pick up, they might rename it
``American Major-League Patriotic Anti-Terrorism Flag War Games USA", in
which case you'll be wishing for the good old days of calling it ``soccer". 

<p>
<i>((You mean there is another kind of ``Major League Football"?? ;-)
The problem with MLS, IMHO, is the lack of ``soccer only" stadia
in places that value the sport enough to build such stadia.
I know from having the Revolution nearby that people don't 
really give it much thought.  About all you hear about it
is local radio talk show guys making fun of the play by play
call of the games.))</i>

<p>
I'm not sure I see what advantages a ``futbol only" stadium would have,
assuming that a FIFA-sized field doesn't put the edges right against the
wall of a particular stadium built for other sports.  The general public
knows where Shea Stadium, for example, is, so they might be more likely to
make a game-day decision to check a game out than if it were at a location
they've never seen.  Given that a large coliseum costs tens of millions of
dollars, or even a nine-digit number, what elements would make a dedicated
stadium so much more beneficial to justify the cost?  Surely MLS can't
swing those kinds of numbers, and communities are much less likely to fund
a one-sport stadium than a multipurpose one with taxpayer dollars.  Or
could we find enough flat fields with wide upslopes on at least one side to
make major-league-viable venues without spending Steinbrennerian amounts?

<p>
OPENING DAY

<p>
The best news of the day is that the Orioles got eight earned runs against
Clemens while beating up on the Yankees.

<p>
A's game is on right now. Still plenty of game left, but it looks good for
the A's. If this guy Park is the best starter Texas has to offer, then
their pitching really does suck. A while back I heard some guy on ESPN say
that the A's are the best team in the AL and the best pitching in the
league, so I guess expectations are high for us this year.

<p>
I've also heard several people say that the AL West is the best division in
baseball, which is no big surprise.  This afternoon Art Howe said that
he'll be surprised if the wild card winner comes out of our division.  That
seemed backward to me, because I would have thought that the best division
would provide the wild card winner, but his reasoning seems to be that
because there are no bad teams in the AL West, none of the teams here will
be able to pad their record by beating up on the weaklings.

<p>
<i>((And the schedule is VERY unbalanced.
I think the Red Sox have 58 games or something like that against
the Orioles, the Blue Jays, and the Devil Rays.
I think 40 wins amongst those is VERY doable and sets up for a great 
record.))</i>

<p>
My least favorite A now is our rookie 1B Pe&#241;a. The media folks are saying
he's popular for his cheerful and positive attitude, but it's not working
for me. Eric Byrnes is another guy who is flowing over with youthful
enthusiasm, but Byrnes is cool, whereas Pe&#241;a just sounds like a goody-goody
kiss-ass.  This impression of mine comes almost entirely from Pe&#241;a's
``diary" on the A's website.  One of the print journalists got the clever
idea of having one of the players giving a regular interview to be
transcribed every day, and Pe&#241;a was the choice.  Presumably there are other
players who would sound just as stupid if I had a chance to read their
thoughts day after day.

<p>
On the other hand, I do like our other 1B, former Red Sox catcher Scott
Hatteberg.  I would have predicted Hatteberg would be the opening-day
starter, but Dye's injury made the question moot.  With Dye in the game,
either (Jeremy) Giambi  or Justice ends up as DH.  With Dye out (last
year's injury still not quite healed), they both end up in the outfield,
leaving the DH spot empty.  Since Hatteberg has a hot bat but isn't so
great on defense, the obvious thing is to make him the DH (batting 3rd) and
let Pe&#241;a play 1B (batting 9th).

<p>
As a batter, Hatteberg is a good fit for our team.  The A's are pretty
strongly committed to a general philosophy of patience at the plate,
consistently going deep into the count and getting lots of bases on balls.
The main reason Billy Beane made a point of getting Hatteberg, and pushed
the idea of converting him to 1B, is because he likes him as a hitter.
Hatteberg's natural style is to be patient, just like the A's like it.

<p>
<i>((I could have told you that was a great deal, I've been telling
John Caruso that all winter.
Hatteberg had no role left in Boston, but he fits your team well.))</i>

<p>
Part of what makes the strategy work is that all the hitters play that way,
so any newcomer to the team is strongly encouraged to adjust. For some it
works fine; for others it doesn't. Dye used to be a more aggressive hitter,
but he changed his style and was perfectly comfortable with it after about
a week or two. On the other hand, I believe one of the reasons Johnny
Damon's batting average was so low for most of last season is that he works
better as an aggressive hitter.  One of Damon's motivations for leaving the
team and going elsewhere is that he wants to be aggressive with the bat
again.

<p>
<i>((And, in Boston, he'll get that encouragement, look at Nomar!!!))</i>

<p>
It will be interesting to see who gets bumped when Dye comes back, both
from the starting lineup and from the team on the whole.  I think there's a
good chance we could end up with the curious phenomenon of a DH hitting
lead-off. There's already been some talk about Jeremy as our lead-off
hitter, since he's not particularly fast. The problem is, we really don't
have a speed guy who hits well enough to be in the starting lineup.  Giambi
is not a great runner, but he has an excellent on-base percentage (in both
respects, like his brother but not quite as much). Part of what the A's
want in a lead-off hitter (and in the 2 spot, too) is someone who will take
several pitches so that everyone else can get a good look. Jeremy does
that, even though he doesn't run well - which makes him sort of the
opposite of Damon.

<p>
Our one speed guy is Eric Byrnes. He's our 6th outfielder (or 5th, with Dye
gone), and our best guy for a pinch-running situation. He was the last one
sent down to AAA for the final cut. He would have been on the team if we
had 14 position players, but Howe decided to go with 12 pitchers for the
beginning of the season.

<p>
We've got three decent LH relievers right now. It was widely assumed
(including by me) that one of them would be traded by now, but apparently
the other teams are on to the A's strategy. They're all figuring that the
A's need to unload one, so they're looking to get him at a discount. The
A's aren't willing to trade away someone whose current market price is
lower than his actual value, so we're going to hold on to all three of them
for now, figuring that (1) one might get hurt, in which case we want the
other two, or (2) some time down the road someone is going to really need a
LHP, at which point they might make a better offer.

<p>
<i>((You also have better left handed starters than anyone else.
When even Darren Oliver can beat the Yankees.... the A's are still THE
best bet to get to the World Series ahead of the Bronx Bombers.))</i>

<p>
At 2B, Howe has been saying for weeks now that he's going to play both
Randy Velarde and Frank Menechino frequently, without choosing one as the
first-stringer over the other. Velarde was the starter for the opening
game, but in his first at-bat he got hit hard by a pitch which bounced off
his shoulder and onto his hand. He stayed in to run, but when the A's went
back on to the field he was replaced by Frankie. The early word is that the
injury isn't serious but it'll take a day or two before he's back up to
100%.  Frankie proceeded to get two hits on his first two at-bats.

<p>
The whole scenario plays really well for Howe in terms of 2B question,
since it makes both of them look good while at the same time emphasizing
the need to have two starting players on the team.

<p>
One of the reasons they like Velarde at 2B, but which isn't mentioned in
the media very often, is that Tejada (SS) seems to play better when Randy
is on the field. Tejada played poorly in the field early last season, and
many thought that losing Velarde had something to do with that. Randy was
here when Tejada was a rookie, and was sort of a mentor to him. I think it
also helps that Velarde speaks Spanish, which Menechino does not. (And
neither does Chavez, notwithstanding his Hispanic name.) Tejada's English
is decent now, but I think he's happier in the field when he has someone
with whom he can chatter in Spanish.

``Blade II" - a movie

<p>
Good solid action special effects `B' movie.

<p>
Wesley Snipes comes back playing the cool black vampire hunter.  The story is 
short on logic but long on action, and action is what it is all about in a 
Blade flic.

<p>
Vampires have raised Blade to a sort of `Boogy-man' level.  They sit around 
and tell each other `Blade' strories to scare each other in the day.  Blade 
is half vampire half human.  He has all their strengths and none of their 
weaknesses.  He is `the day walker'.

<p>
Then the story descend into pseudo science and things get very fuzzy.  
Vampires are infected by the bite of a vampire which passes a virus that 
takes 72 hours to convert a human to a vampire.  Some vampires are born from 
vampire parents and are considered to be full bloods.  Blade is a half blood. 
 But, if the whole thing comes down to a virus infection, then what is his 
secret?  

<p>
Along comes a genetic mutation in the virus and we get Reapers.  Super 
Vampires who prey on vampires the way vampires prey on humans.  Right down to 
the infection by bite that converts the vampires to reapers.  Reapers can't 
be killed like vampires, except for daylight.  Blade still has the day walker 
monopoly.

<p>
So, the remaining vampires come to Blade to help them fight off the Reapers.  
Turns out nothing is quite as it seems, except for Blade who is still the 
baddest guy on the block.

<p>
There is almost a love story between Blade and the girl Vampire who has 
trained her whole life to kill him.  Sex appeal crosses all barriers.

``Changing Lanes" - a movie

<p>
This the story of two men, `Doyle Gibson' (Samuel L. Jackson) is a reforming 
alcoholic whose marriage is over.  He is trying to preserve his relationship 
with his sons by buying their mother a house near to him so she won't take 
them across the continent.  `Gavin Banek' (Ben Affleck) is a New York 
attorney on his way to file some papers which will allow his law firm to 
legally loot a 100 million dollar trust

<p>
They are brought together while both are rushing to the same court house.  A 
fender bender accident, flattening one of Doyle's tires and causing Gavin to 
drop the papers is their point of contact.  Gavin is in too much of a hurry 
to stay to chat.  Doyle gets the important file but loses the time he needs 
to present his custody plan at court.  His ex-wife is awarded full custody 
and the right to take the boys across the country.

<p>
The movie is about the battle between these two.  Both are subject to giving 
into baser nature.  They would rather fight than reason.  

<p>
They take turns doing each other bad turns.  Occasionally one or the other 
will have a momentary turn towards sanity, only to be swept up by the latest 
escalation from the other.

<p>
Jackson is outstanding as the erratic Doyle Gibson.  His wife left him 
because he had no control over his temper and she feared for her boys.  He 
really tries to overcome his weakness, and he repeatedly sets himself up to 
fail.  Affleck is even better as the shallow Banek, in it for the big quick 
buck lawyer, who starts to discover a conscience.

<p>
Very good supporting cast.

<p>
Great movie.  Thought provoking.

``Frailty" - a movie

<p>
This is a psychological thriller.  I went in expecting some sort of horror 
venue.  After all, the name Stephen King is dropped in the ads.  Considering 
that the story is about two generations of serial killers, there was very 
little actual gore.  Still, this is not a movie you want to try to explain to 
your kids.

<p>
Bill Paxton directed and played the father.  Matthew McConaughey plays the 
narrator and adult version of one of the two brothers.  Most of the story 
takes place when the boys were 7 and 12 (or so) and their father was visited 
by an angel from God.  As dad explained it, the three of them had been picked 
by God to seek out and destroy demons who were disguised as humans.  They 
were `god's hands' in the war against evil.

<p>
The older boy, Fenton had reservations.  The younger boy, Adam, immediately 
bought into the whole idea.  It was like they were super heroes.  And, they 
were doing god's will.  How much better can it get?

<p>
Twenty some years later, the FBI are searching for a brand new serial killer 
who has labeled himself 'hands of God.'  Powers Booth plays Special Agent 
Wesley Doyle, the man leading the investigation.  McConaughey comes to him 
late at night to tell him that his brother was the killer.  His brother is 
dead now.  There were more demons in the world than he could face so he ended 
up taking his own life.

<p>
Booth is more than a little skeptical at first but as McConaughey tells the 
story of how his father took the boys with him on demon hunts, and how they 
buried the demons' remains in an old rose garden, and how the older boy tried 
to rebel but was starved into submission, Booth starts to believe.

<p>
Very well acted by all.  Paxton is excellent as the loving father who tries 
to teach his boys the difference between right and wrong.  His version of 
right and wrong, with demon slaying as part of right.  The two child actors 
were totally convincing. 

<p>
Really good movie.  Thought provoking.

Edward Norton and Robin Williams do some ``out of character'' stuff for the

This was one of those movies where people were consciously un-typecast.
Costumes and production values were sensational and the story wasn't too

``High Crimes" - a movie

<p>
Jeffery Deaver, the author of ``The Bone Collector" constructs his stories 
using the famed onion model.  You start out on the outside and bit by bit you 
peel away layers, discovering more and more, until you get to the heart and 
understand it all, then Deaver reveals one last layer that you never 
expected, the true heart that is different from all you had concluded, but 
still totally consistent with the story as it was told.  ``High Crimes" tries 
to tell a story using that model, but when you get to the center the final 
surprise is somewhat akin to discovering a peach pit in the center of the 
onion.  It is a surprise ending all right, but there is no way it should have 
been there, not from the story that was told.  Oh well....

<p>
Once again Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman team up.  This time they have James 
Caviezel in a large supporting role.  Great cast.

<p>
Despite the plot defects the acting was quite good.  Once or twice in the 
beginning I felt that Judd was putting on expressions for the camera rather 
than from the character, but once the film got moving she became totally 
believable in the role.

<p>
The director created lots of tension through choice of camera angle and 
position.

<p>
Not a great movie, but one I enjoyed.

<p>
Back to Deaver, and ``The Bone Collector".  I've been reading that some people 
are disappointed that Denzel Washington won his Academy Award for playing a 
`bad black cop'.  I think they are missing the point.  Denzel played a good 
white cop in ``The Bone Collector".  Sure, he is black, but the character he 
played is white.  Who is to say that the character he played in ``Training 
Day" isn't white?  Get over it people.  He is a great actor who played a 
complex role and deserved to win the award for it.  It wasn't about color.

``Panic Room" - a movie

<p>
I will go to see Jodie Foster any time she makes it onto the big screen.  
Once again, it was worth the trip.

<p>
``Panic Room" is about a mother and daughter who have just moved into a house 
that used to belong to a very rich recluse.  Part of the house includes a 
home invasion shelter.  On the first night in their new home it is invaded 
and they flee to the panic room.  

<p>
That's where the story starts.  The developments are as much in the 
characters of the invaders as in the tension of two women faced with a 
terrifying invasion.

<p>
Everyone was excellent.  There was not a false note played by any of the 
actors.  

<p>
The camera work was innovative in that the cinematographer used computer 
editing techniques to allow the camera to pass through solid objects as it 
followed the action.  If there was a flaw at all it was the camera work's 
cleverness which at first drew my attention away from the movie.

<p>
There is violence and gore.  Hollywood is getting more realistic about that 
all the time.

<p>
Forest Whitaker was excellent as the burglar who fell in with violent 
thieves.  Kristen Stewart did an outstanding job as the daughter. 

<p>
I think it would be fair to say I really liked this film.

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage but they have turned us down.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.
HELP!!!
Will this ever begin?? 
You lawyers are going to have to scour the depths of the sewers.... i.e.
the courtrooms and law offices of the world... and find me some lawyers 
to play this game, before the NO lawyers game finishes!

<p>
Note that Buddy's ``sample game'' of Air Sea Diplomacy starts in this issue.
I do have a copy of the rules and I will print them next issue.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Since the only retreat is an annihilation, there isn't actually anything
due for Summer except press.

<p>
2) As all of you know, Allan's postal address is vacant, but his E-Mail
seems to be working.  I'd like a postal update by next deadline please, Allan.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FOOL to BOOB): How do I keep up with 48 and 72 hour games if I can't keep
up with a 3-week game? Simple, I don't. I'm not playing in any. Well,
there are gunboat (no-press) games, but they're a lot less time, and
besides, that's not Diplomacy, right? Also, I only counted two weeks this
turn.

<p>
(BOOB to FOOL): Yes, the ``three week games'' really are ``two week games'',
but like this season that includes Summer seasons even where nothing 
actually is due.

<p>
(DESPER LESSONS): OK, here's what I've learned thus far:

<p>
a) Germany and England are both being played by two guys in Australia who
apparently think ``two against the world" is a viable way to play the game

<p>
b) Tim talks to me more when he's my GM than when he's a player in the same
game

<p>
c) Austria really wants to be my friend (or so he says)

<p>
d) Fool is drunk.  Though he'll claim otherwise.

<p>
e) the Russian position sucks, no matter how you slice it.

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA): Sorry Rick, I hope this works.

<p>
(BOOB to HAMMERED): Yeah, sure, I'm sure Rick hope it works too....

<p>
(TURKEY to the FOOL): You know, if you're going to be the court
jester you might at least say something funny.

<p>
(FOOL to RICK): And when he's done looking under L-E-P, you can look under
W-H-O-A-S-K-E-D-Y ...

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): Sorry, that was the best I could do....

<p>
(BLURBIST to THE POPE): Germany, Turkey, Russia . . .
they were all whispering evil evil things about that
army in Venice. Ven-Tri, Mun-Tyr . . . the stuff of
nightmares. And the whispers wouldn't die! They just
twined about my thoughts like a chill wind through dry
branches. I had to stop them somehow! Those orders
were the only way!

<p>
Well, not the only way. I am currently fashioning a
Thought-Shield out of tinfoil and coat hangers. It
makes my scalp bleed, but anything that lets me be a
better ally to you is worth the pain.

<p>
(TIM to FOOL): Let's fight.

<p>
(FOOL to TIM): Them's fighting words!

<p>
(TURKEY to the BARON): I'll write you a real honest to God letter
soon - I promise.

<p>
(BLURBIST to SULTAN): How is it possible to have
thirty-two finals in one academic year?

<p>
(BOOB to BLURBIST): Chicago has this weird fascination with finals.
They seem to have one for each credit, so 32 credits equals thirty-two
finals....

<p>
(BLURBIST to KAISER): You see, the joke is, I say to
Allan, ``What do you think of Jim's Munich
contretemps?" And Allan thinks I'm talking about some
weird medical problem or something! Get it? Funny,
right? Right?

<p>
(BOOB to BLURBIST): I don't know about that, but I do Allan is stealing
even MORE of MY money...... he better get his postal address fixed soon!

<p>
(FOOL to SILLY HAIKU PERSON):

<p>
 Spring's Sprung, Grass is Riz.

<p>
 Don't know where my money iz.

<p>
 And I can't count either!

<p>
(BLURBIST to ADAM/HEATHER): When you and the Pope are
done, maybe you and I can . . .

<p>
(BELGIUM - GERMANY): Hmmm. They don't look too impressed with your Aussie
alliance with Mutey, do they. And unfortunately for you, you seem to be
taking most of the fire for it, while England gets off Brit-free. Oh well,
that's geography. Don't complain, look at me. I start off with one center
and no units, how's that for lousy geography?

<p>
(BLURBIST to KING): (points to his own mouth, then to
King's ear, then shrugs and tilts his head quizzically)

<p>
(TURKEY to GM): So how'm I doin' with this press thing? When
we're complete I plan to run an OLS regression on quantity of supply
centers owned with variables quantity of press and quantity of beer
ingested before sending move. I hope there are no multicollinearity
problems with that...

<p>
(BOOB ECONOMETRIC WHIZ to PUP TENT TURKISH TRAINING CENTER): Watch it,
kid... don't get cocky.  
Those multicollinearity problems have a way of sneaking back around and
bitin' you in the butt!

<p>
(BLURBIST to ETYMOLOGISTS): When I was a junior in high
school, I had the odd experience of a common phrase,
somehow long hidden from me in the folds and wrinkles
of my life-long discourse, suddenly revealing itself
to me in a half-dozen forums in the span of a few
months. 

<p>
The phrase was ``sea change," and when I first stumbled
upon it, I was utterly baffled to its meaning. So I
looked it up, thought, ``Hmmm . . . cool word," and
then placed it on the more inaccessible shelves of my
vocabulary, planning to pull it down when the rare
chance presented itself in order to impress friends
and associates.

<p>
<i>((Yeah, but no matter WHEN you use that word,
most of the time it goes unheard and misunderstood
by those to whom one communicates it - in either
writing or voiced in person.
Neat words that are not understood become slightly less
neat.))</i>

<p>
Then, as if I had shimmied over into an alternate
universe where ``sea change" was as common an
expression as ``Wicked cool," I came across the phrase
practically every week in newspapers, magazines, books
and billboards (well, actually, the billboards didn't
show up until five or six years ago when Sea Change,
Inc. opened an office in Maynard).

<p>
<i>((Yeah, and it STILL is a misunderstood word.
There isn't ANYTHING in Maynard that isn't overwrought
and a bit too puffed up..... whoops, YOU'RE in Maynard,
aren't you..... never mind....))</i>

<p>
It was a strange coincidence and one that still leaves
me puzzled.

<p>
I bring it up, not only to fulfill my press quota, but
because a similar coincidence occurred just these past
few weeks. I have long used ``The Blurbist" as my nom
de web, an alter ego born during my days of writing
catalogs when I was cocky still enough to equate my
specialty with words to John Wayne's character's with
guns in the movie ``The Shootist."

<p>
However, despite five years of conversation-starved
on-liners quizzing me on the meaning and history of my
ID, not until last week did anyone ask me the origin
of the word ``blurb." Ashamed to admit I did not know,
I quickly threw open my American Heritage Dictionary
(the same one with a smiling photo of O.J. Simpson
sharing a spread with the images of a silverfish, Neil
Simon, the Sinai Peninsula and an example of a sine)
and copied the following from the etymology listing of
the word: ``Coined by Gelett Burgess (1866-1951), Amer.
humorist."

<p>
``Well, what do you know?" I thought. ``Won't the
Archbishop be amused that his namesake accounted for
my nameplate?"

<p>
<i>((Not a bit, not a bit.... fate, I'd say.))</i>

<p>
And then, not more than a handful of days later, I was
reading an article on the charitable practice of
established authors lending their words of praise to
be placed on the book jackets of new writers, despite
in most cases never having read any of the books they
are praising, when as an aside the author of the
article explained that a jacket ``blurb" took its name
from a word coined by the American humorist Gelett
Burgess.

<p>
An unparalleled coincidence? No. A riveting anecdote
you will not be able to keep from sharing with loved
ones? No. A satisfactory fulfillment of my press
quota? It will have to do.

<p>
<i>((Gee almost time to have you arrested by the 
Deja Vu police....))</i>

<p>
(BLURBIST to THE TEMP TSAR): Thank you for the answers
in last year's press. Here is your completed Mad Lib:

<p>
 The ICFMM Picnic

<p>
One warm summer's day, everyone from I Can't Find My
Money decided to have a picnic. ``Tim, will you bring a
horrendously convoluted ratings system?" Blurbist
asked. [Yes], said Tim. ``Jim-Bob, will you tell us
another story about how you preserved the integrity of
Diplomacy by rigging or throwing an endgame?" [Yes],
said Jim-Bob. ``Rick, can you invite von Neumann and
Morgenstern to discuss combinatorial game theory while
they serve us cheesecake naked?" [No], said Rick.
<i>((Because we don't want von Neumann and Morgenstern
ANYWHERE near our blessed game of Diplomacy....
we'll take a healthy helping of Mr.&nbsp;Nash, a sprinkling
of Mr.&nbsp;Simon, and brisk seasoning by Messrs. 
Machiavelli and Wotton - Wotton he of the phrase
``An ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad
for the good of his country''.))</i>
``Fool, what will you bring?" [Apricot jam], said Fool.
``Silly Fool!" they all laughed, ``Always spouting
nonsense!"

<p>
Once the blanket had been spread and the food laid
out, Blurbist asked Allan what he thought of Jim's
Munich contretemps. [Yes, he is a little funny
looking], said Allan. Everyone's jaws dropped, so
shocked were they to hear Allan speak. ``Jim, did you
ever think such a thing would come from Allan's
mouth?" Blurbist asked. [But no, I've never thought he
had bad breath], said Jim.

<p>
Just then, the conversation was interrupted by an
amorous raucous. ``My God!" Blurbist exclaimed. "Who is
that smearing cheesecake all over the naked bodies of
von Neumann and Morgenstern?" [Naomi Watts, of
course], said Heather Taylor. ``Heather Taylor?" said
Blurbist. ``Isn't your name Adam Mitchell?" [Yes], said
Heather Taylor. ``Oh, I see," winked Blurbist. ``Is that
why you and the Pope are so closely allied?" [Maybe],
blushed Heather Taylor.

<p>
<i>((Good, if Naomi Watts is around then everyone
else is sure to clear out soon..... and we'll get
down to the good stuff.))</i>

<p>
Just then, a ravenous river of army ants [whistling
``Bridge on the River Kwai"] washed over the picnic
party, stripping every last screaming tortured soul to
gleaming white bone.

<p>
THE END

<p>
<i>((But not Naomi, tell me NOT Naomi!!!  The
rest of them are completely expendible of course.))</i>

<p>
1) Note Jack's small change in his E-Mail address and Matt's larger one.

<p>
2) Looks like some neurons might have been misfiring somewhere in these
orders, but I'm just the GM, I'll let all of you sort it out.
Retreats only due next time.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOZ to EL PRESIDENTE):  Last time I checked, the name was ``Diplomacy", not
``World War I".  So I'm going to continue talking, and fight when I need to
or have to.  When will you listen?  If you're not going to listen, will you
at least check in with reality now and then?

<p>
(TSAR JACK-SULTAN GOZ): You're in the fire now, getting married at your
advanced age. Congratulations anyway. You know I hope this means we can
still be friends. When is the bachelor party and will there be police
involved??

<p>
(SUNNY-GOZ): Best wishes on your impending nuptials.  I can vouch for the
first five years.  Get it done soon-I miss the sound of your letters.  

<p>
(GOZ to ASSEMBLAGE):  While the wedding is over, I've got a LOT of things on
my plate.  I'll talk as I can.  Look for a new address/email address soon.

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ AND SUNNY): Yes, Goz, let me add my best wishes as well.
And I've been bugging Matt about getting his Master's thesis on the
game of Diplomacy out into the light of day....

<p>
(ENGLAND WITH SOME REAL LIFE STUFF):  Hi there.  getting in earlier this turn.  
cubs home opener and a bachelor party tomorrow.  
I'm not sure I'll be able to type for 48 hours.

<p>
(TSAR JACK-GOZ): Now that you've gotten the first wife, drop me a note about
married life, having kids, and swiping dots.

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY):  About flippin' time you started talking.  Can you hang
on here?

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): The Duck just knows how to make himself REAL essential....

<p>
(TSAR JACK-EMPEROR DUCKY): You're not the Sackiepoo Don, that's Dougie. Yes,
yes, I'll pull your chestnuts out of the fire this time, but don't get used
to it. I'm not very relible, ask Sackiepoo.

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA):  Are you still here?

<p>
(TSAR JACK-EMPEROR SACKIE): Look just give me Bud and you can keep Vie and be
my toady. I'll let you issue nasty press about the Eyeties and Towel heads.
It's probably the best offer you'll get in this game.

<p>
(TSAR JACK-KING JODY): Sultan Goz hasn't written me about you yet so I think
the romance is cooling but someone keeps calling and hanging up, that
wouldn't be you would it?

<p>
(TURKEY to ITALY):  Are you sure about this?

<p>
(TSAR JACK-PRESIDENT JIM): You know I never thought of you as the toading
type-have I misread my Frenchmen???

<p>
(EDINBURGH-MOSCOW): Our apologies.  Hope I get it right this time.

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA):  He's talking now.  Any idea what he's saying?

<p>
(DATELINE COPENHAGEN):  Drunken sailors take over German ferries and collide
in a game of chicken gone horribly wrong!  German fleet decimated.  Scottish
Navy jubilant.

<p>
(TSAR JACK-KING MATT): No letters or calls???? I'm starting to feel cheap and
used-not that I mind that but at least you could have bought me dinner and
a few small dots (or even big ones.)

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND):  This game is going to change in a big way.  What part
in that will you play?

<p>
(MATT): If there's a delay, I'll try and come up with more press.  And the thesis.
I've always wanted to see what the hobby thought of it (if I can retrieve it
from ancient Macintosh disks).  

<p>
(BOOB to MATT): Ah, yes, the ancient disks.  I'm not sure I can retrieve things
I have on 5 1/4 floppies any more..... don't worry, the back issues of <i>TAP</i>
are NOT among those files.

<p>
(TSAR JACK-GM BOOB): Note I got flapjack of comcast.net as my new e-mail in honor
of my hobby nickname-isn't that grand????

<p>
(BOOB to FLAPJACK): Grand indeed!  Let's get the griddle hot!!
Let's saute up these late additions to the press....

<p>
(TSAR JACK-KING JODY): We shall see what we shall see in Munich. I've decided
to send an army to see for myself, people do tend to exaggerate in this game
you know.

<p>
(BOOB to TSAR JACK): Looks like your wandering army got lost on the way to
Munich to me, but who am I to say??

<p>
(TSAR JACK-KING MATT): I want peace in the north-a piece for you and a piece
for me!  &lt; wink, wink &gt; 

<p>
(TSAR JACK-KAISER DUCKY): I'm behind you all the way-check out my army in
Boh.

<p>
(BOOB to TSAR JACK): Oh, THAT one found the way just fine.... I'm less sure
about the one checking out the East Prussia and the original German homeland.

<p>
(TSAR JACK-PRESIDENT JIM): I'd fire your foreign minister, he speaks with an
English accent. A French foreign minister should have an outrageous French
accent.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Quiet summer.
OK, I've been having complaints about not underlining failed orders.
As an experiment, I'll try doing it here the way that it is easiest to do.
You can let me know if you like it.
I'll start in the fall.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DOWN AT THE BARROOM):  It was one of those quiet nights at the Doo Drop Inn. 
I was in my usual perch next to Shreevy and pondering the significance of 
life while sipping a beer. This was more than Billy the Creep was doing 
with his frosty mug. However, he was complaining about soap operas, 
so he wasnt all wrong. He was just boring. 

<p>
Shreevy jumped in at a pause and muttered loudly, ``What about that damn 
night time hospital soap?" There was silence.

<p>
Ya know, I think they calls it ``Days of Our ER." Mebbe its ``As the ER Turns."

<p>
Crazy Henry displayed an unusual flash of insight when he responded, 
``No, I think it's `All My ERs'." 

<p>
``Whatever. The old lady likes it, but me, I think its crappy how 
something bad is always happening to someone she likes on the show. 
Course it gives me a good reason to be here on Thursday nights." 

<p>
``Thus, we can say that `As The ER Turns' is a good influence on people, 
so let's drink to that," I noted. 
There was general approval in the barroom ratings. 

<p>
Hear. Hear.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Michael Lowrey tells me that you need only 102 centers or 3/4
approval to get a draw to pass in this, and I believe 50 centers
is required for a win.
Forgive me if this sounds ``weird'' since anyone except Dave
Partridge theoretically could be voted out of a draw.
Clarifications or comments would be welcome.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot, see
Prussia above.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY to HIS MANY DEAR FRIENDS, SUMMER 1901):
Well, the bombs have been dropped, and now comes the time to sort out 
neutrals and assess damages. Whilst I am unhappy that France nuked Holland 
(and we will need to discuss this matter further, Mr. Muller), yet I see no 
reason for Germany to do anything but obtain its traditional SC of Denmark 
this Fall. This means I will make no attempt whatsoever on any other powers' 
home SCs or any other of the Neutrals. In return, I ask that you make no 
attempts on Denmark, Berlin, Munich, or Kiel. I understand, of course, that 
sometimes greed overpowers sweet reason. Still, I must gently point out that 
I will have five nukes that I can use in Spring 2002 and at the moment have 
no meaningful target for them. Perhaps you might want to leave the situation 
at that. Thank you for your time and attention.

<p>
(KENDTER to SCHULTZ / KENNY): Well, I just need to decide which one of
you pissed me off more for 1902.

<p>
(SIGNIFICANT OTHER KENNY to HARRY A.):  I happen to read about your cat
issues.  I have a solution.  You need a dog.  They make GREAT pets.  And
not one of those small ones, but at least an eighty pounder.  Get a BIG
dog.  He'll take care of your cat problem.  And you won't have to worry
about the catfood being left in the bowl, going bad.  In less that five
minutes after the dog enters you place of abode, any food or anything
even remotely resembling food three feet from the floor or lower will be
permanently out of site, out of mind, and out of your life. 

<p>
(BOOB to PAUL): Remember, I'M a cat person.... ;-)

<p>
(PAUL): That's ok, nobody's perfect.
Actually, I just had the opportunity to spend the last four days with my
dog alone (Sandy and the kids are visiting relatives in Delaware for
Spring break) and I am about ready to become a cat person.
Sam can wear out his welcome anywhere.  Even at home.  Someday I'll have
to tell you about the Great Thanksgiving Apple Pie Massacre.

<p>
(SARA REICHERT-JIM BURGESS): Hi, sweetie! Just wanted to let you know that the 
Russian Fleet in Livonia can move into Portugal by traversing 16 black holes: 
Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic Sea, Prussia, Silesia, Galicia, Rumania, Serbia, 
Bulgaria, Black Sea, Constantinople, Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, Tunis, 
Tyrrhenian Sea, West Med, and Spain. The other three Russian units can 
support it in.

<p>
(BOOB to SARA): Indeed!  Lots of choices this time!!

<p>
(FLAPJACK - KAISER HARRY): You know I love you man - that's why I want you to 
take good care of those cats. They will be the only pussy you get for the 
rest of your life.

<p>
(SIGNIFICANT OTHER KENNY to HARRY A. AGAIN): And sometimes even those
furball cats resemble food. 

<p>
(ITALY to THE WORLD): BITE ME, if you can find something to bite.

<p>
(UPDATE ON THE CATS): One of the cats (Tyler) died, cause unknown. It turns out 
that all seven cats are semi-feral, and their previous owner did little to 
socialize them. The good people of PACT (People And Cats Together) have given 
me a cage to put Pearly in, and she now occupies that cage that is sitting in 
my bedroom. It has a litter tray at one end, food and water at the other end, 
and is covered by a blanket when I am not in the room. This may seem extreme, 
but the people of PACT have a lot of experience in socializing semi-feral 
cats for adoption. When I am in the room I take the blanket off and talk to 
her, and pet her, and groom her. I am hoping for the best.

<p>
(MORE FROM LEE): WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This royal blows - no need to even figure out the game :(
No orders needed here.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK to WORLD): For those of you who may be interested in what I 
look like nowadays, please go to: 

<p>
http://menopause.tripod.com/lol_gallery/

<p>
And click on my name. Yes, I am now clean shaven, since my facial hair 
nowadays grows so slowly that I only need to shave once per week. I have two 
dimples as well, as many lady friends have commented on.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.
There really isn't any excuse except that I can't count, but the last
two slots should have replenished with an 8 and a 10 respectively.
This is corrected above.
But Alice replenished correctly, didn't she?  Note
that she did NOT Break Away last turn, she was on 81 and Rhombus
was on 80.

<p>
3) And that's all the Sprint Points, on to the finish....
slowly.
We have only one replenished card as a high as a 7, and that's
for Brandon the Kiwi, who is quite far in the back.
All three of his cards played in the next three rounds
still doesn't get him to 100!
Well, we'll assume SOMEONE knows what they are doing.

<p>
4) We also have a rules question in the First Press Item.
Input from the designer is required....

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TOM HOWELL):
Now, I have to ask:  If I played Alice for 14 to square 98 and Christie
for 5 to 99 this turn, would that constitute Christie's `rejoining the
pack'? Or does a rider have to pull ahead or him, or even?  If yes to
the first question, then he could break away on the subsequent turn with
Alice playing a 3 to 101 and Christie his 10 to 109 for an 8 replacement
card.  Then he could cross the finish line with a bit of authority - and
a turn sooner!

<p>
(BOOB to TOM): My clear ruling on THIS case would be NO, Christie would
still be the pack leader.
The move you made also is clear, Alice has broken away though not very far.
What is NOT clear to me is what the ruling would be if Alice had a 15 and
used it while Christie used the 5 and BOTH were on 99.
Then they would BOTH be leading the pack. 
Would we use the fact that Alice is an A rider and say SHE leads for that
reason??
I'm honestly not sure.
John, your thoughts please??

<p>
(ALICE to GAME DESIGNER):  A one?  That wasn't a Break Away! although I
was thinking I wanted one...  A one?  I'd have been happy to take it, as
I would use it ... NEXT turn!

<p>
(BOOB to ALL): Then again, perhaps we DON'T want to ask the game
designer for advice...

<p>
(ALICE to GAME DESIGNER):  A break?  Nah, see above to Prescotty. 
However, we WERE worried that one of his teammates might have messed up
Christie's break this turn ...

<p>
(BOOB to ALICE): Uh, I just moved that other note to ``below", I try to
weave this press together with some sense to it, rather than just stacking
it up randomly.

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  QUADS): Since you guys have no cross-sectional area at all, you
should be really kicking butt!  Or are you not riding with your plane
of embedding parallel to the race direction?  Tsk, tsk.

<p>
(BOOB to PETEY): Now, you're SURE that's parallel?  What if we're
in a non-Euclidean world where there are multiple parallels??
Which universe are you in now??

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB):  Don't really matter what kinda equipment I carry
inside this dress.  It's what my riders do with theirs that counts.

<p>
(TOM to BOOB):  Yeah, I've noticed that riders who gloat before the race
is over tend to upend in the ditch.

<p>
(BOOB to TOM): Guilty as charged, I'm getting my goose cooked in 
the <i>Tinamou</i> game and might even finish FOURTH!
The White Maid still has SOME equipment inside that dress, even if
she won't admit to it or gloat/brag about it!

<p>
(QUABS-QUADS):  You fellas were supposed to stop that breakaway!

<p>
(ALICE to PETEY:  Nah, it's just these 10 league boots I wear.

<p>
(ALICE to PRESCOTT):  Play a five and replenish with a three?  You're
supposed to play the three and R with 5.

<p>
(CHRISTIE to ALICE):  At least he didn't play the 6 and cut down my 10.

<p>
(ALICE to PETEY):  Or was that Christie of Clint Hill's replacement card 
you were asking about?

<p>
(ALICE to PRESCOTT):  Nah, no more big cards for me.  I got enough to do
the job.  It's me teammates I'm worried about now.

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  BRITS): Reservoirs, 
C'mon lads, we can catch up!  All we need is a little TeamWork!

<p>
(BOOB to PETEY): You won't get it from THIS crowd....

<p>
(WHITE MAID to PETEY): Them Reservists had me sweating there a couple of
turns back.

<p>
(WHITE MAID to ERIC):  Well, ...  we're playing this in a Dip 'zine,
aren't we?  Still, it might be a tad late for this game.

<p>
(TOM to ERIC):  I better not tell our GM how I do it, else he'll get
really tough and then no one would have a chance in any game!

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  GM): this must be the must surreal of the bike races we've done
yet.  The Brits, Bad Boys, and Border Riders are all mostly normal.  But, though
I thought my team of flightless birds would be the weirdest, I think that
reward is either won by the team which has four large bodies of water riding
bicycles, or the team which has four 2-dimensional, 4-sided geometric shapes
riding bicycles.

<p>
(BOOB to PETEY): One wonders at least if anyone recalls that the game is 
about drafting.
No drafting in this crowd!

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB):  Ok, we give!  How goes the one about a one armed
economist?

<p>
(BOOB to WHITE MAID): One of the most famous Presidential quotes of
all time is: ``Give me a one-armed economist!" demanded President Harry S. Truman. 

<p>
President Truman was the first president to appoint a council of economic advisers. 
Unlike some later presidents, he actually liked to listen to his policy advisers. 
However, he preferred a clear recommendation, not a long discussion of the advantages 
and disadvantages of a particular course of action. 
And long winded discussions of equilibrium and the effects (both pro and con) of
particular policy actions are what economists specialize in!
Just ask me sometime to explain what I think about health care policy.....
my last published article on the subject is extremely dense and long winded.
I sent it once to Richard Weiss.... and he was kind in his criticism... ;-)

<p>
Anyway, Truman quickly grew tired of economists who gave a good recommendation, 
and then began, ``On the other hand. . ." 

<p>
(ERIC BROSIUS):
I taped Ken Burns' Public Radio series <i>Jazz,</i> and I've made a few
observations about what
I do and don't like.  As you may recall, I wrote a few years ago about my
puzzlement regarding
this kind of music;  I enjoy <i>Jazz Decades </i> on Sunday nights with Ray
Smith, but I don't
care too much for what's on most jazz stations most of the time.  This is a bit
frustrating,
because I would like to enjoy it;  I can't imagine all the people who talk and
write about it
are just making it up.  So you have to take these comments with the
understanding that I'm
probably somewhat clueless-but that doesn't mean my comments might not be of
some interest
to others.

<p>
First, I can't understand why the cymbals have taken over jazz to the extent
that you can
hardly listen to anything recorded in recent years that isn't soaked in
cymbals.  I just don't
like the sound of that cymbal very much, and unless you're listening to retro  
stuff, it seems
you can't avoid it.  I mentioned this observation to a friend and he said it's
like the <i>a
cappella </i> groups that imitate drums on every cut-to the extent that he
really enjoys it
when he hears an <i>a cappella </i> group do a song <i>a cappella.</i>

<p>
Second, I realize after watching <i>Jazz </i> that I enjoy almost everything up
to and including
the advent of Charlie Parker, with the frantic runs of notes he introduced.  I
enjoyed his
music as well, but what I don't seem to enjoy are other people imitating
Charlie Parker.  Maybe
I just need to listen more (if I can ignore the cymbals,) but it doesn't seem
to me that other
people (in general) do this as well as he did, or well enough for me to enjoy
it.  As a result,
I seem to prefer stuff recorded in the 20's or 30's, or stuff that imitates
that period.

<p>
Maybe the next time I write to you on this topic I will have made some more
progress<font face="symbol"></font

<i>((Hi Eric,  I had a chance to read your message more closely and
I agree.  That about sums up my viewpoint too.  I spent a year
in college (1978-79) with a three hour weekly jazz radio show
and I worked really hard that year finding quality, but what
I liked the best was the 20-30's stuff.  
Here and there I would find other things that I found interesting,
and I talked to lots of the other jazz programmers about how my
show sounded and other than the annoying sophomoric tendency I
had at the time to play occasional Herb Alpert and the Tijuana
Brass cuts (also plagued by cymbals, of course....) they kept telling
me I had a great show.
But I played a LOT of Bessie Smith, who is my love from that period.
But you also have to remember that these things are about context.  
I find what I like best in jazz that is NOT in the class you talk 
about (and actually even FROM the 20/30's as well!) are the female
vocalists, some of whom ARE doing some quite interesting things
with songs.  And I haven't heard a human sound like a cymbal yet.
Most recently, as I said, I consider Diana Krall the best of these.
And she is no slouch as a piano player either!!!))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/
currently is on hiatus.
I'll try to remember to let you know when it returns.

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Your blood moves - only the
music can speak for a soul lost in such depths.''  A statement
by the Sinning 'n Prayin' MEKONS from the cover of <i>Crime
and Punishment</i>, great little 45 RPM (remember those??)
record of theirs from 1986 featuring some really twisted
songs like ``Beaten and Broken'' and ``Chop That Child in Half''. 
Seems fitting for this group...
