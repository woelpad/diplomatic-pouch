<p><br><p><br>We have ALL the subszines in this issue and it looks to be a blowout.
I had lots more (including some letters) - in fact one person sent
me a card and didn't sign it with some more Civil War comments and
an ``anti-Tinamou" - pictures only - comment.
Ring any bells?
Step up and claim it before the next issue when I may print it anyway.
I also had some stuff I wanted to say and am holding that too.
Read and enjoy:

<p>
<b>THE DEADLINE FOR <i>TINAMOU</i> IS JANUARY 10TH</b>

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
I am going to defer rate increases for the moment, but
only until the current series of game starts is completed.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.
These prices are due to increase in the near future so take
advantage of them now.

for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target

<p>
Hi Jim. 
Thank you for the monster #210 that arrived in Saturday's mail. Yes,
there were a lot of familiar names: I'm surprised to see that so many have
stuck it out in Dipdom. In the decade or so that I was active, the game
part got pretty tired; even the regional Cons hardly had any Dip toward the
end, as I recall. My own <i>Brutus Bulletin</i> probably paid little more 
than lip service to the game in its latter issues, being mostly letters and
discussion. Maybe the last 2/3s.
   
<p>
When I got Glenn's letter to send, I thought the information requested
was for verification purposes; didn't expect to see it all in print. 
Oh, well.
<i>((I thought some of your old friends might want to contact you directly.))</i> 
I'm opening two more postal THIRD REICH games (4th edition, campaign
games, 3 player format), so perhaps the advertising will do me good? Or do
most Dippers still form a cross with their fingers, and back away from The
Sign Of The Hexagon?
<i>((I think you might indeed get some bites.
Perhaps even John Caruso would be interested!!))</i>

<p>
In your response to the `letter', you made the statement ``Check out
Kathy's situation below..." Sorry, I looked, but never found any Kathy
stuff. Saw Kathy Caruso's name as a player further back, but that was it. 
<i>((That's what I meant, but I wanted you to look at her SITUATION
in the game.
Then, see this issue's game results....))</i>
I see she's still at that same old Norristown address. On the other hand, I
did see a lot of waxing nostalgic for ``Uncle Bernie"! Sort of like walking
into a chat room and finding a group of aging Stalinists crying in their
beer about the good old days under Uncle Joe...
<i>((Perhaps.... I hope we are doing a little more than that.))</i>

<p>
I thought Paul Rauterberg's item about the fellow in prison having mail
problems was pertinent. One of my best players is salted away in Iowa, and
he too has occasional delays, while neanderthal staffers try to figure out
what a wargame zine is. If they can at all.
   
<p>
It was interesting to see all the net references in the addresses. Two
years ago, probably half or more of my gamers and GMs had online
access-altho half of them had it only at work-but in the past year, it
has dropped way OFF. I would have thought that if an old stick-in-the-mud
like myself gets into at least part of this fast system out there, almost
everyone else would arleady be way ahead of me. (It's not difficult to do!)
But right now, of 6 active games, I have exactly 1 person who regularly
reads his mail, and another that can get to it once a week or so. That's
IT. Pathetic. And strange.
<i>((I do understand that you have to either be able to ``control yourself
on the Internet'' or stay away from it so you can live a real life.
I use this as a tool.
I like to write.
I have to talk too much on my job and I like using E-Mail and finding 
things, but I almost never just ``surf''.
All things considered, I check mail A LOT, but spend very little time
on the Internet.
That's the way to do it in my eyes.))</i>
   
<p>
Well, thanks for the free sub. The music and press stuff gets fast
priority to the recycle bin, but I appreciate this ``window on the hobby" as
it were. It's kind of like getting up from your grave, and peeking in the
window to watch how survivors and descendents are getting along-a trip
with the Ghost of Christmas Future. Thanks.

(Sigh) I didn't even know what feuding was in those days.  And being
in Bernie's szine and not feuding was like being a blind man at an 
x-rated movie.  ``They are doing WHAT????"

<p>
Speaking of which, I was in San Antonio, Texas one time on government
business and I asked to be put up in a motel close to the work site.
Turned out they were on the east side of town near a clover leaf and the
motel was mostly frequented by truckers.

<p>
I figured the nice young ladies with big hair and small outfits might be
off duty house keepers but they smiled at me a lot more than most hotel
staff.

<p>
Then I get to my room, a nice Motel 6 sort of room.  All the basics,
clean, functional.  And after unpacking a bit start to channel surf.  They
had all the basics AND they had the Triple XXX network.

<p>
My...oh...my...

<p>
Through the use of potentially Oscar quality camera work I watched every
sexual act I had ever performed, dreamed of, worried about, and a bunch
that I had to take notes on, without ONCE being able to see actual
penetration.  I suppose that was in case someone with children was staying
in a motel in the middle of Texas and had to leave the kids alone with the
TV for a bit.

<p>
The kids would just have to assume that like Barbie and Ken these people
had no sexual organs and just liked bumping together in all those
different ways and yelling and screaming like that.

<p>
Reminds me in a way of pro wrasslin'.

<p>
Speaking of mind wrassler's, is Markle Farkle Berch still out there?  I
don't see <i>Dip World</i> so I have no idea who has taken over the 
title of most arrogant player/writer in  the hobby.  
I could have been a contender but I think there was some sort of 
requirement that you had to take the hobby
seriously and by extension your presence in it.  Steve Emmert seems like a
potential rising star but he needs to get a lot nastier first.
<i>((No word from Berch in years.
He isn't Number One on my search for list, but I might get around to
him sooner or later.
I think Emmert has the potential, but will never realize it.
It won't be because he isn't capable, but because he doesn't have
quite the ego for it.))</i>

you did!!), although it isn't usually politic to say so.
I've lost touch with Bernie, although his son James Alan Tretick
was playing in games recently that I saw (recall, he played as
James Alan with a maildrop).  I really should make BERNIE the

In fact, I will make him the next one early (see above).))</i>

Hi, Jim:
I received a letter from John this morning, saying that there should
not be further problems along as we do not use game abbreviations.
We'll have to remember what each of those Modern Dip codes stand for!
On the outside of the letter was the stamped message:  ``Marion
County Jail II is not responsible for contents of letter nor has it been
censored."  Hooray!  Chalk one up for ``freedom of speech"!
   
<p>
<i>((The SZINE is FULL of codes..... what a field day that would be, yet

wants to pretend that they still are ``setting standards".  Sad....))</i>
 
<p>
Yeah, John says that ``...those people are incredibly arrogant."  I trust
he's right.
I already filed my complaint to the Indiana Atty Gen's office by fax.

Hey guy, can you send me Larry Peery's snail-mail address?  
<i>((He closed the ``Diplomacy'' post office box awhile
back, so he is just using his home address, which is:

I pulled a
clipping on archives from the newspaper a while back, figuring it'd
interest him if he didn't see it (off the AP wire).  The <i>TAP</i> with his
kiss-the-Cardinal's-seat story only had his URL and so this has been
sitting around a long time.

<p>
I sent words of encouragement toward Mark Lew and Paul Rauterberg
toward more pubbing.  (Heck, it's easier than actually doing a szine
myself.  Or even faking one as you seem to beg for occasionally.)  You
are to blame.
<i>((Is this something I should contest?

As usual snail-mail hasn't caught up, though the electronic copy has
been on-line for a while.  Or is it not the distribution system but the

<p>
What's the ``Price is Right" problem?  I know about the ``Let's make a 
deal" problem: Monty offers you a choice of curtain 1, 2 or 3.  Two 
curtains conceal gag gifts, one curtain has the prize. You pick 1.  He 
shows you the mule behind curtain 2, and gives you the opportunity to 
switch from your original pick of curtain 1 to curtain 3: should you 
change?

<p>
<i>((The Let's Make A Deal problem also has attracted some considerable 
academic research.  There, the big issue (there's only one player) 
is about preferences of certainty (what Monty Hall has given you 
that you're holding in your hand) vs. uncertainty (what's behind the 
curtains).  Research in that area helped to finally lead to the 
explanation of ``lottery preferences" where people are willing to 
risk small amounts of money and VALUE the dream and excitement
of waiting to see whether the BIG prize is theirs!))</i>
      
<p>
<i>((The Price is Right contest has FOUR players and thus is a true 
multi-player game.  Unlike Diplomacy, this is a sequential game since 
each player tries to predict the price of a product without going over 
in turn.  The closest without going over wins.  Economists like me are 
interested in this problem because of its similarity
to the Burger King/McD's/Wendy's problem about where to locate 
on a busy street.  They ``cluster" together as they sequentially
choose their locations trying to be closest to the most customers.))</i> 

<p>
Is there a web address for this Danny Loeb's work?  Thank goodness it 
was socialist French tax dollars that went into the research and not 
American.
<i>((Danny Loeb's web page is:
http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/Annuaire/loeb_pub.html))</i> 

<p>
<i>((I think by moving around there you can find his Dip stuff although 
I haven't looked there in quite a while.  This is just copied off 
my Bookmarks.))</i>

<p>
You didn't propose a solution the Let's Make a Deal dilemma: is it 
better to stick or switch?

<p>
<i>((Oh, sorry, the idea is that when you analyze it in expected value 
of the box you end up with, it is almost always (depending on the 
parameters of the problem) better to stick.   However, people are MORE 
likely to switch, which (given the uncertainty) makes them look like 
``risk lovers".  But we know that most people are NOT risk lovers, but 
are risk averse.  The solution is (proposed anyway) that people value 
the uncertainty ``in itself", those few moments where their heart 
skips a beat as they wait for the door to open or the curtain to be 
pulled back or the box to open. 
The same idea led to the solution of the lottery problem where people are 
deemed to value the ``dreaming" of winning while they wait for the numbers 
to be drawn.  Otherwise no one would buy lottery tickets since the 
expected value is so low.  The ads for the lotteries also make this 
``dream motive" clear.))</i>

<p>
Ah, the perfect example of the difference between the economist (you) 
and the mathematician (me, the computer scientist standing in for the 
mathematician).  While motivation, etc., is (I admit) interesting, it 
is not purely measurable, and therefore ultimately unimportant.  
Mathematically (mmmmm, probability theory), is it better to switch or 
to stick?
     
<p>
And here my poor economist you are wrong: it is mathematically better 
to switch. You will more often win if you switch, given the chance.  
Doesn't make ``sense," I know (because ``nothing changed"). The 
mathematics have not been explained in an acceptable manner to me, but 
being a computer programmer I wrote a 10 line program to check it out. 
And it was true: you won more often if you switched (I ran it over 
10,000 chances).  I don't recall whether the margin was 1/6, the 
difference between ``half a chance" and ``a third of a chance."  But 1/6 
would make sense to me, mathematically.
Didn't mark lew discuss this problem in your zine two or three years ago?
     
<p>
The difference between a mathematician and a computer programmer, by 
the way, is that, after writing his program and determining the 
answer, the computer programmer then forgets that he has completed the 
task and embarks on trying to write more efficient code to solve the 
problem again!
     
<p>
Don't get me started on lotteries!  As you might guess, I'm impressed 
only with the odds, and therefore do not play.  I buy your ``dreaming 
of winning" description/motivation/value hypothesis. I try to keep 
that sort of thing in mind and not launch into a tirade whenever 
approached by coworkers eager to throw money (away) into a lottery 
pool.  I try to politely decline, biting my tongue and realize I 
cannot talk them out of it and save them their money.  Hopefully they 
get their money's worth out of the dream.  But I suspect they just get 
their money's worth out of harassing me, saying, ``When we win and all 
quit you'll be the only one left working here."  That's when I lose it 
and launch into my tirade.
     
<p>
Wow.  Type [``monty hall"] in your search engine (I use Excite) and 
stand back.  I forgot the name of the problem was Monty Hall, not 
``Let's make a deal" (you unduly influenced me).  Nothing but hits.
Sorry, no mathematical problem hits on [``price is right"].

Scott Morris nominated the Talking Heads ``Take me to the River."  I had
nominated ``a song" from <i>Stop Making Sense</i>.  
I think that probably is the
quintessential party song for 5+ years in my life.  Every party with

You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
I'll start the voting at the beginning of 1999, so you have just 
a very short time to get additional songs into the bullpen list.
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; ``Dance This Mess Around'' from the B-52's;
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

<p>
``Gloria'' is probably going to be that final song on the list, 
but I want to find a memorable recording.
Does anyone have some suggestions for me on that front? 
A Van Morrison version?  
The original Them version??
A cover???
It is also remotely possible that I will decide to put
``Gloria'' in along with another song and leave ``Dance This Mess Around''
to be voted in.

<p>
The ``bullpen'' is the list of suggestions that people make
that I haven't decided whether or not to include yet.
Comments on the bullpen are, of course, actively encouraged.
I also am ``working'' on some ideas Mark Luedi tossed out recently.
I liked Mark's ``criteria addition" that:
``One of my own criteria for truly great songs is that it can sound as
good or better distorted as not, whether on account of poor signal, bad
speakers, tape deterioration, car noise.''

<p>
BULLPEN: ``Rocking the Casbah'' - The Clash; ``Dancing With Myself'' -
Billy Idol's Gen X; ``Walk This Way'' - Run-DMC; Prince - ``1999";
``Fire on the Mountain'' or ``Cumberland Blues'' - the Grateful Dead; 
Devo - ``Whip It"; ``Shake, Rattle, and Roll'' - Big Joe Turner; 
B Movie - ``Nowhere Girl"; B-52s - ``Give Me Back My Man" or 
``Rock Lobster" or ``Planet Claire'' or ``Love Shack''; 
``Roadrunner'' - Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers; 
Strunz and Farrah - ``Americas''; Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown - 
``Up Jumped the Devil''; David Bowie - ``Fame''; ``party at ground zero'' by
fishbone; ``Tweediee Dee'' by Lavern Baker <i>((Wanna explain that one,
Stan??))</i>; ``Been Caught Stealing'' - Jane's Addiction;
``Hard to Handle'' - Black Crowes; ``Birth-day'' - Suzanne Vega;
Doors - ``Road House Blues"; Cure - ``In between days";
Bangles - ``Hazy Shade of Winter"; Violent Femmes - ``Blister in the sun";
Go-Go's - ``Our Lips are Sealed"; Peter Frampton - ``Do you feel like we do";
Led Zeppelin - ``Hey, Hey what can I do"; Three Dog Night - ``Shambala";
``Party Train'' - Gap Band; ``Proud Mary'' - Ike and Tina Turner;
Concrete Blonde - ``Still in Hollywood".

<p>
SPECIAL GEORGE CLINTON BULLPEN: ``I Just Wanna Testify'', ``Let's Take
It to the Stage'', ``The Pinocchio Theory'', and ``Flash Light''.

<p>
SPECIAL ROLLING STONES BULLPEN: ``Satisfaction", 
``Paint It Black", ``Jumpin' Jack Flash", ``Get Off of My Cloud'',
``Sympathy for the Devil''. 

<p>
SPECIAL TALKING HEADS BULLPEN: ``The Great Curve'', ``Take me to the River",
``Life During Wartime'', the entire <i>Speaking in Tongues</i> record. 

<p>
SPECIAL DRUG MUSIC BULLPEN: ``Cocaine'' - Eric Clapton's version;
``Casey Jones'' - the Grateful Dead; ``Red, Red Wine'' - UB40;
The Toys - ``Smoke Two Joints''; ``Panama Red'' - New Riders;
``Smoke, Smoke, Smoke (That Cigarette)'' - Commander Cody and His Lost Planet
Airmen; and ``I'm an Okie from Muskogee'' - Merle Haggard.

Hi, Richard,
Phil Reynolds is offering an opening in Perestroika in his xyn
<i>ISHKIBIBBLE</i>.  

<p>
Contact him at ``preyno of yahoo.com" if you're interested. 
He's also offering other variants and Snowball Fighting.  Prices and
reliability are reasonable.
   
<p>
``Take Me to the River" was one of my favorites of that era (a musical
wasteland in my opinion) and still sounds good today.  ``Smoke Two
Joints" was one of my most-enjoyed songs at Yellowstone events (covered
by Hot Tomato, with whom I engaged in the referenced behavior) but I
hadn't known who wrote it.
   
<p>
I had the same thought as you upon seeing the ``party song"
categorization.  I made a list but never sent it to Jim.  My list didn't
overlap yours much; some samples:  ``Magic Mountain" (the Animals); ``The
Pusher" and ``Magic Carpet Ride" (Steppenwolf); ``Revolution" (the
Beatles) for the doo-wop backing vocals ``should we do a bong" ...
``should we do a few bongs"; the Eric Ozog, I mean, Tom Petty song ``Get
to the Point"; ``Legalize It" and ``Pass the Dutchie" (Peter Tosh).  Not
all of these would be good for Jim's criteria but they'd be good for a
reggae-type gathering.
   
<p>
I fear C. Jones is gonna have a stroke if you (or whoever wrote the
Modern Dip item) keep it up.  Inducing untreatable medical problems was
an accepted diplomatic stratagem in the Soviet era, but not in Dipdom. 
Anyway at this point a replacement player would probably make similar
orders, so it would only help if you could ``gain a tempo" with a German
NMR.  Looks like only a French NMR would give you that.

Dear Jim-Bob -

<p>
I am one of those heathen swine who are actually glad the
NBA is locked out.  (1)  More time (and TV airtime) for
hockey.  (2)  It's always amusing to see 6'9" millionaires cry
over missing the payments on their Porsches.  (3)  Maybe
we'll get lucky and the lockout will continue past the end of
the NFL season.  Then it will be nothing but the
aforementioned hockey until Spring Training begins.  If I die
after that, it'll be okay.

<p>
Excuse me, but our local paper has reported what I take to
be a practical joke:  Jesse Ventura elected governor of
Minnesota?  I have a couple of pals up there who are going to
get razzed mercilessly on this one.

<p>
I'm taking Sondra to see Chris Isaak on November 22 in
Norfolk.  This keeps me on the Good Guy List.  If it tops the
Pat Metheny Group concert we saw this winter, I'll be very
much surprised, but I can be a dutiful husband and have a
good time, too.

<p>
Hope you and Charlotte are well.  Best wishes.

ok, guess i'll finally get motivated to send in some entries for you.  i
did two lists - one for normal folks &amp; one for music snobs, but couldn't
make up my mind which one to submit so you get stuck with both (sorta). :)

<p>
jody mccullough made my exact point re "midnight rambler" - even down to
naming "get off of my cloud" as a superior alternate.  and mentioning
&#223hake, rattle, &amp; roll" (big joe turner version, not bill haley) even
though you didn't add it to the choices...somebody has been peeking at my
notes!

<p>
in the great b52's controversy i have to toss in a vote since i worship
them to this very day after 20+ years...  "love shack" definitely!  yeah i
know it actually became a hit &amp; you're allergic to that sorta thing but it
has such exuberance it's impossible to sit still.  i know there's a lot of
nostalgia for the older stuff, but if you're not gonna pick "private idaho"
then your judgement is suspect anyways.  ;)

<p>
without further ado:
"locomotion" - little eva
&#223hake, rattle, &amp; roll" - big joe turner

Jim -
Got the note on the back of TAP#210.  Yeah, I think Livingston will do 
about as good a job as Speaker as possible.  Gingrich was a 
revolutionary, but not a manager or legislative leader.  
<i>((One of those obvious perceptions that is so obvious that one
wonders why it wasn't universally realized earlier.))</i>  
   
<p>
The problem, of course, is that nothing will get done in the House 
over the next two years.  It simply is not in Gephardt's interest to 
permit anything to happen (unless is it a part of his own agenda, like 
raising the minimum wage or passing huge new tobacco taxes).  Gephardt 
wants to be Speaker, not to have it look like a thinly-led Republican 
House can work.  It may be so bad in the 106th Congress that the 
Senate could turn out to be the more activist body.  Our Founding 
Fathers would be turning over in their grave over such a prospect.  
(Not, mind you, that the Senate will be all that activist itself...it 
is only relative.)
     
<p>
My current boss, Sen. Hagel, is busy preparing for a run for a Senate 
leadership position:  the head of the Senate Republican Campaign 
Committee.  My guess is that he will decide today or tomorrow to make 
the challenge.  If he does, it will be the only leadership race in the 
Senate.
     
<p>
Saw the Billenness comment on the burial of the official ban on split 
infinitives.  Doesn't he realize how important it is for him 
steadfastly to reconfirm his heritage proud and stalwartly to stand 
athwart history and shout ``stop?"  [Apologies to Wm. F. Buckley, Jr.]
     
<p>
BTW, sorry, Simon that it looks like your law may have turned out to 
be unconstitutional.

<i>((The whole idea of governing by gridlock is kind of fascinating to me.
One take on this, as I understand it, has been happening in Britain where
they are again contemplating the abolition of hereditary peerage in the
House of Lords.
Over in Britain, the House of Lords is the great equalizing obstructionist
body.
And it gets driven by those people who sit there through heredity.
I'm very far from an expert on the House of Lords, but strangely enough
if they banish the hereditary peers then won't the Church of England 
bishops dominate the House of Lords?
Then it may tend to become even more of a religious conscience for the
government.
How different from the way religion and politics have been mixing over 
here lately??
Just some thoughts to fill the last page to see if we can generate some
cross cultural debate....))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>One additional regular game will be started in addition to the
full one noted below.
You can send your $15 for your life of the game sub and
game fee with NMR insurance now.

<p>
Players in the game starting now are: 
AUSTRIA: Kent Pollard ($15), ENGLAND: Terry Tallman ($15), 
FRANCE: Scott Morris ($15), GERMANY: Jim Sayers ($20), 
ITALY: Scott Munson ($15), RUSSIA: Luke Dwyer ($15),
and TURKEY: Mike Barno ($15).
I have to come up with a game name and collect full postal, phone,
and E-Mail contact info from everyone.
I'll put that together for next time and set a Spring 1901 deadline date.
I did a random draw on the countries since most of you didn't
provide preference lists.
I will put a little insert in the players' copies with contact 
info that I know.

<p>
Roland Sasseville is the only one definitely set for the next game.
Others have told me they will be playing but haven't sent me money yet.
This includes Harold Zarr (who should send money now).

<p>
I also am trolling for players for Colonia VIIb.
I have direct interest expressed from David Partridge, Robert Stimmel,
Paul Rauterberg, Gene Prosnitz, and Stan Johnson.
Could we firm that up in the next few issues, please?
I am still looking for ideas on what I will need to know to run Colonia.
At this point, I will be running it WITHOUT printing a map in the szine.

<p>
On yet another front, I'd really like this Black Hole game to start too!
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change.
I STILL am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Jody McCullough, Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, 
Phil Reynolds, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press in the last game, 
we'll call it Nelson Mandela.
Just TWO more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!
Best of all, you will be feeding the GM's interests and winning immense numbers
of Brownie Points.

<p>
Last, but far from least, I will be opening a game of Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules enclosed in this issue!!
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I'll take input on this idea.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Species 8472 has been in two segments of Voyager and is a very intriguing
diplomatic race (their episodes are the only Voyager episodes I've liked
in the last year) and the rest of the races should be well known to all.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke is the editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117.
Conrad is discussing folding this service.
I think actually it needs someone to pick it up with a web page
where it can be posted.
I'd like to nudge Stephen Agar into talking to Conrad about taking
it over and putting in the postal section on <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i>
page, where this szine also resides.
This appears to be happening, though it is not official yet to my knowledge.
This could serve both the Brit and US hobbies!!
I realize that I should probably volunteer to do this since I'm the most
active contributor to that page, but I'd really rather not.
What we need is for the postal openings to be accessible on the Net.

<p>
1) If I need to correct or add any contact information above, please
get it to me ASAP.
Thanks!

<p>
2) I am really, really sorry about the way this one has started up.
Doug just never showed up for the game.
Since I had to replace him, I asked Eric Ozog's brother (who was in
line for the new game) to take this position instead.
Happily, he agreed.
Kurt is well known to a few of you (especially some of the neighbors
of Austria) and I thought that would be the quickest way to get
this back on track.
I think we need until January, so I have set the new Spring
deadline to then.
My house rules (reprinted in this very issue) cover this unhappy
eventuality.

<p>
3) For fun, I have printed some of the press that was aimed at
the former Austria, as well as some general press.
I hope no one minds and everyone will give Kurt a chance.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA):  If you're not going to diplome to anyone can I have
Vienna before everyone else gets it?

<p>
(VENICE to TRIESTE):  We haven't heard from you, thus we assume you
don't care?  We only hope you've submitted moves this season, so
that our knife can slip in firmly and deeply.
<i>((No such luck, so this becomes a ``do-over''.))</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND, GERMANY, AND RUSSIA): I understand you
three are all related somehow, perhaps through your curious
Queen Victoria and her heirs.  We shall keep this in mind in
exchanging state secrets with fewer than all of you.

<p>
(ROME to SKYWALKER): Luck?  What does that have to do with Diplomacy?

<p>
(GO-EL to JIM-BILLY-BOB):  Just what flavor press is this anyway?

<p>
(JIM-BILLY-BOB to GO-EL): Black, very black, just like your heart and
the color of your pieces!!
You can write anything from anyone.
See the enclosed house rules for more details!

<p>
(EARTH to AUSTRIA):  Anybody there?  Hello?

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE):  The CIA once maintained a
bungalow in the South Pacific where they housed Argentine
ex-president Juan Peron.  When he died, they put South
Vietnamese ex-president Nguyen Van Thieu there, reasoning
that Thieu could live as cheaply as Juan.
<i>((Oh, come on, haven't you told that one before?
I know I've heard it before, numerous times....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Let me know if anything about the set-up is confusing.
I tell you what card you replenish with in each slot and then update
the hands for each rider.
Especially toward the beginning, double check me!
Note that the seven slot is covered by the first turn ``crowd'' rule.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TFWS - CREATOR): Knowing nothing - just guessing - and my first
cards appearing unorthodox next to the rest - I take some comfort
that I'm more comparable to you than I am to the rest of the crowd.

<p>
(DESIGNER - TFWS): Sorry, old boy, having a bit of bother understanding
your banter.  ``Can I draft?" you ask.  Not if you are the General
Manager of the Carolina Panthers, apparently.  ``Drafting" is referred to
as ``slipstreaming" in the rules and means the same thing, I am told.

<p>
As for running out of gas, over here in Blighty gas is something you
cook with or suffer from after drinking too much fizzy pop.  If you run
out of gas (i.e. get tailed off) just hitch a lift back to the finish
line and watch the rest of the race on the telly.

<p>
And talking of cultural differences, it would be bloody handy if you lot
would ride on the right hand side of the road and leave lots of room for
us on the left.
<i>((They've left you lots of room PERIOD!))</i>

<p>
(STOOGECYCLES): Curly plays a bag of Acme #4 Caltrops 
(guaranteed to get your point across) on square 6 as he enters square 7.  
Larry sends two quarts of Mobil 1 oil in a high lob onto square 5 at 
the same time.  Mo goes for the classic eye gouge on any rider sharing 
square 9 with him.  Shemp gets set to record the fun on his trusty camcorder.

<p>
(GOZ to YOU-KNOW-WHO):  This had better work.

<p>
(STOOGES to GM):  How many reloads is our supply truck allowed to carry?

<p>
(GM to STOOGES): Is that oil or what?
You're messing up my track with all that oil!!

<p>
(CHEF): Hey - who called me a Brit!  I'm an Afro-American and proud!  If
you don't believe me, check this out.  OK, kids, let's sing!

<p>
(KIDS): I want to ride my bi-CY-CLE, I want to ride my BIKE.
I want to ride my bi-CY-CLE, I want to ride it where I like.

<p>
(CHEF):  Oh, fat-bottomed girls, they make the rockin' world go round.

<p>
(STAN): Um, Chef, wrong song.

<p>
(CHEF):  Oh, the bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin', that's
what I said!

<p>
(KYLE): Chef!

<p>
(CHEF):  The looser the waistband, the deeper the quicksand, or so it's
been said.  My baby fits me like a (CENSORED)

<p>
(ERIC): OK, that's it. This is where I draw the line.
I'm leaving.   (Eric starts to pedal away
merrily.  He is unaware of Kenny fitting a firecracker just below his
seat.)  See you losers later!  
(The firecracker explodes, and flames start shooting out of Cartman's
butt.)

<p>
(ERIC):  Help!!!  The aliens are back!
(Eric shoots off into the distance, powered by the rocket-propulsion
created by Snacky Cakes and Cheesy Poofs.  Kenny, Stan, and Kyle
quickly hop on their HellCycles and draft behind the voluminous
Cartman.)

<p>
(TFWS - EVERYONE): No press?
This isn't going to be the strong, silent sort of group I hope.
<i>((We didn't end up doing too badly.... but the designer got
separated from the pack in last.
Does he know what he's doing??
I suppose we will see.))</i>

1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``We struck out on a hard beaten road;
Slow down you're going too fast; My red face burnt and bare feet tore;
On jagged rocks; Where's my baby face?''
From ``Maverick'' off of the <i>So Good It Hurts</i> album.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): <i>TAP</i> #210 with a deadline of 24 October probably
will not arrive before I leave for Turkey on 5 November.
If I survive Armenian terrorist activities, Kurdish terrorist activities,
Fundamentalist Islamic terrorist activities, gang attacks,
assassination attempts by disgruntled Greeks who were castrated, disease,
tinamous, and the hoards of T-shirt sellers, I should be back on 23 November.

<p>
(UKR - FRA): Enjoy your trip to Turkey!  Takes lots of pictures, especially
around those coastal installations.  Send me postcards.  Use code A-12.
Don't get caught!

<p>
(RICKY to GERMAN LUCY): ``Lucy, you gots some splaining to do."

<p>
(MACHIAVELLI to WORLD): Have your books ready.

<p>
(MUNICH to ST.PETE): Well you wanted Sweden so badly, we just didn't
have it in our hearts to deny it to you.  It will, after all, likely serve
as the burial grounds for your Tsar....
<i>((Russia doesn't own St.Pete anymore either.... and he removed the
unit in Sweden.
Things don't look so good....))</i>

<p>
(BRITAIN-BRITAIN): No matter what I do I telegraph my moves.
Have I been hoodwinked?
Hornswoggled?
Someone needs to offer explanations.
Could it be the ``New Math''?
Someone's pulling my leg!
No!!
<i>Two</i> someone's are pulling  <i>both</i> legs.
Damn!

<p>
(MACHIAVELLI to GERMAN): ``How praiseworthy it is that a prince keep his
word and governs by candor instead of craft" ( The Prince ch 13 opening)

<p>
(A TURKISH ZEALOT to THE PROPHET): O great one!
O most beloved!
Where are you in our time of need?
I call to you.
I beseech you to join in and give us your blessings!
Come.
Speak to us, O Mike Barno...

<p>
(MACHIAVELLI to ME): -rest of chapter
The man who received the strong package to sender-I am so there.

<p>
(JOHN BOY-GM): I'm not sure but I don't <i>think</i> I'm answering
myself yet.

<p>
(ROME): There's a cold north wind a blowin'!  
Time to shore up the northern border.

<p>
(BERLIN to LONDON):  Are the censors still at work, denying us our legal
rights to communicate?  We have written to you again, and have sent
a scolding to the man in the black hood.  If things don't shape up
immediately, the Indiana Attorney General's office will be alerted!

<p>
(POLAND to UKRAINE): What am I seeing?

<p>
(URKAINE): Today the world was shocked as the first press reports came back 
from the Ukrainian peacekeepers who have entered Bulgaria to restore order
after the shocking excesses of the Turkish invaders.  It was a far
from pretty site, supeona papers clogged even the smallest government
offices, preventing any real work from being done.  Children were
forced to learn creation ``science" alongside their real studies,
and liberals everywhere had had their houses defaced and were forced
to wear an L patch on their clothing.  ``This is one of the worst
cases of Republican cleansing we've ever seen" reported the commander.
``It makes the Washington scandals pale in comparison.  Luckily our
brave Italian comrades were not afraid to come forward and expose this
heinous crime to the world and help us to take action."

<p>
(AMBASSADOR AT&#196;TURK P&#214;-LLARD to THE NATION OF THE UKRAINE):
It would seem that my suspicions were correct.
Judgement was made when a fleet was built and then sailed into
the Black Sea by your nation.
It was by Allah's will that the 1st Turkish Army was moved out of
harm's way and repositioned in Istanbul.
Our shame is great.
But, our vengeance will be great!
With that, I have been empowered to inform you that a Declaration
of War is now issued and that we as a people will not rest until
either the Ukraine or Turkey lies in a pile of burned out ashes.
May Allah have on you, for we will not...

<p>
(KAISER to POLAND): Die! Die! Die!  

<p>
(THE SULTAN to THE WORLD): War is here.
The time to give battle is now!
I call upon Infidel and Holy Ones.
Little and big.
Brave and Coward.
Let this be the Mother of all Battles!
I declare Jihad!
Jihad!
Jihad....

<p>
(FILE PHOTO 797#): The people will bring Andruschakatian to their
enemies.
The people are zealous.
The people will never surrender!
Death to the Ukraine....

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) As the players already have been notified by E-Mail, I have decided
to correct an error I made back in the fall season when I permitted 
Britain to make a build because I miscounted the number of units
on the board.
The fleet that Britain built bounced Turkey in the Indian Ocean in
the Spring.
That result will stand, but I am going with this correction at
the ``earliest possible moment".
I have slightly adjusted my house rules (reprinted in this issue)
to account for the way I made this ruling.
I thank the British player himself for originally pointing out
the error to me!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HOLLAND):
The Dutch government issued a brief statement today saying ``At the
present time, our scouts have not returned with a full detailing of
all events.  Preliminary observations indicate that the English
government has complied with the recently-signed Treaty of WhupAss,
signed by our delegate Kenny McCormick.  Also the Treaty of
GetOutOfMyFace, which the predecessor Pip refused to sign before his
untimely abduction by the minions of Hell, was recently agreed to by
his replacement, Damien, and the ambassador Stan Marsh.  

<p>
President Ronald ``Dutch" Reagan continues to enjoy his convalescence
in the capital of Jakarta.  He sends his support out to his cabinet,
which oddly enough consists of four 8-year olds from Colorado and the
school Chef from their elementary school.  Apparently the cabinet just
started an international bike race with some bunnies, a few British
ghosts, the Four Stooges, four guys wearing prison uniforms, and the
cast of ``Breaking Away".  Best of luck, kids!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
<p>
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is STILL
missing... someone find him!).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) The game is now over as all four players voted for the draw.
I thought the game had some play left in it, both because Don
Williams still had a unit in Russia and because the stalemate
line there was still not locked up.
But the players rule.
I do think it was likely that Keith would have done what needed
to be done, so it is likely we would have been here eventually
anyway.
Don gets a survival and Doug doesn't.

<p>
3) I will have the end game stats in the szine next time and
then the end game statements will be due the season after that.
All current and former players are welcome to comment.
I printed all the press anyway, just for fun.

<p>
(PARIS to WORLD): Now it's ``digging in the heels" time!

<p>
(ANKARA to EX-GERMANY): Our third build was an ill-gotten gain, due to
the unsurprising treachery of the French and English re: Germany. We
regard Warsaw as yours, so we will make no build for owning it. 

<p>
(ANKARA to BREST): Our established ownership of Venice and Rome may have
taken an extra season, but we kept took them fair and square, and shall
not give them back. We'll take the builds for them, and try to use them
to seize your other ill-gotten dots. 

<p>
(KEITH to DON): Thanks for checking your messages.  And following up. 
Now please just support me in Moscow continually, unless I leave another
11th-hour phone message for you.

<p>
1) All draws and concessions are still rejected.
With fall orders please vote on a concession to Germany, and FG, FGT, GT, and
FGTA draw proposals.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MR. low HOF): I wouldn't put that once as your fault.
I've played this whole game with Rick and I've never been able to
understand him.
Rick can't explain his way out of a wet paper bag.
Rick can't win a game, he doesn't have the skill.
As for three times you could have won, crap and more crap.
I've never seen a Turkey/Austria win.
<i>((Neither have I, but of course there is no such thing as
a shared win so this is not surprising.))</i>
It's too half assed an alliance to work.
The other players would have to be as dumb as dirt for
it to have a prayer.
You should have tried for an alliance with Harold or me to get a win.
Now kill Rick, he deserves it, for the poor way he played in this game.
Better yet, let me kill him.

<p>
(PHIL R. to CHARLES J.): Let me help you
out here. I've met Mike Barno and I hope to meet him again. I haven't
met Richard Weiss and I hope I never do. I haven't met Dave Burgess
but I don't know if he wants to meet me.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): Thanks for writing.
I was laid-off and had a death in the family last month and kind of
spaced out Jim-Bob's letter with <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>.
You jogged my memory.
I will move as you suggest.
It is fun watching Turkey (Mr. Low HOF) fuss so.
I do believe I am with you, this is the most fun I've had in this game.

<p>
(TUR-GERRRYGERM): ``What do Mike Barno, Roland Sasserville and Daf Langley
have in common?  Toss up question for College Bowl.  10 point question.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MIKE B, DAVE BURGESS, THE STAFFORD BROTHERS, AND RICHARD
WEISS): If you want me to believe in you, you will have to contact Harold
Zarr.
If Harold tells me that you are real, then I will believe.
    
<p>
(TUR-GERRRYGERM): ``What is, all mention R Weiss in <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>
#210 Issue?"  Jeopardy host Bart Simpson asks?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): I do if I have anything to say about it.
That is always my goal, every game I play.
    
<p>
(TUR-GERMYGERRY): Can you put one and one together?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): In answer to your last question, I play to win.
I never stab, except for a sure win.
Never, for one or two centers.
It's a waste.   
I only eat an ally to win, and if I can't win I support an ally forever or
until he stabs me.
Then I turn and kill him.
Thus my desire to kill off Austria, he stabbed me by taking Munich and moving
into Germany's non-supply center territories.
If an ally wants to give me his supply centers so I can win, great.
I have no moral problems with it.
There is no reason to allow Austria to participate in any draws, he has
no power and only one unit which you and I have locked into place.
Why you wanted him in, in the first place, is beyond me.
By the way, France can keep one center and I can win.
So he'll survive just like Austria and he did a lot better and had more
say in this game.

<p>
(TUR-MIKEYLIKESIT): That figmented lightless closet without retinal
photonic stimulation and therefore pigmentless imagination is getting
crowded.  I never saw a germ either - guess they don't exist.
    
<p>
Actually Austria is the one that I don't believe exists.  he says he
lives in NorCal he says he's coming to Dead Poet Con, he . . . well, no
wonder I narrowed his sphere of influence.
   
<p>
(FRA-TUR): Well, I was certainly not surprised by your remarks in the
last issue of <i>TAP</i>.
Your ``peculiar style'' is strange only by the standards of decent society,
certainly not those of you and your perverted friends in San Francisco.
Still, living with that scaggy, crack addicted 'ho (who goes by the name
`Lotta Goo') of yours probably seems quite normal to you by now as well.

<p>
I do not want you to be of the opinion that I believe you and your 
homo-people have no value.
That is decidedly untrue.
Medical research needs lots of specimens on which to conduct experiments.
You and your people could fill that need quite nicely.
You are readily disposable, currently provide no benefit to society,
and are the dead-end rejects of evolution.

<p>
The only question is, where to put you do that you can be in a controlled
environment?
The perfect answer would be to empty the state of North Dakota, and build a
wall around the entire state.
The amount of food, medicine, fuel, and so on provided to you could then
be easily controlled, and you could be used as a ``laboratory'' for 
studying the effects of changing these inputs to an environment for the
rest of us.
Of course, there would be no need to waste valuable medical resources
on the people located there, beyond that which could provide benefits
to the decent population of these great United States.

<p>
From your comments, it is obvious that you people take no interest in
wanting to defend or support our great country.
You seek only to exploit the resources of our country as a means to
support your immoral lifestyle, and then have the audacity to
tell the rest of us that we have no right to object to the manner in
which you live.
I think you should go back to slurping out of your AIDS straw, and forget
trying to tell the rest of us what ``bad'' people we are.
The message just won't sell!

<p>
(TURKNOTJERK-HOF BOARD): Don't forget to allow DaveB to vote, and now
Roland is in.  He supposedly lives in Rhode Island.  We all know that Rhode
Island is too small for more than Jim Bob and his Mark Lew-like wife (did
you let her read what you said about her, Booby?) so Roland can't exist. 
Hell, Rhode Island is too small to have a 666 Smith St. even though there
is a 664 and a 668.  So, JimBoob invented him.  I have talked with Roland
numerous times.  And if you want to play perestroika sometimes, it was a
figmented variant from <i>TAP</i>.  Geez, I liked that game. 

<p>
(FRA-GER): What a gas!
I know that my throwing the game to you is driving Turkey wild, especially 
since he can't do anything about it.
He is such a moron, it would be impossible to believe if he didn't live in
San Fran.
No doubt, aids has so rotted his brain that it is probably all he can do
just to fill out his orders sheet, let alone put together a coherent 
sentence.

<p>
(MINUTES FROM THE HOF COMMITTEE): 

<p>
Mike B: Did you read Richard's press in #209 in COlumbus Chill?
He thinks that he and that ninny Rick could have won three times.
What is he smoking?

<p>
Don S: To think he could have allied with the better players, Charles
or Harold.

<p>
Dan S: Why hasn't he killed the Austrian player?

<p>
Jim-Bob B: Someday I'll tell Charles Jones a long story, he has earned it.

<p>
Mike B: Who forgot to take away Richard's vote?
With that crappy HOF rating he doesn't deserve it.

<p>
Don S: I'd vote for taking away Richard's vote, and for getting some of
the stuff he is smoking.

<p>
Jim-Bob B: Did I tell you guys what Richard did with a group of sailors of
various nationalities during Fleet Week?
Well,..... he..... it got stuck in....... can you believe it?

<p>
Mike B: Richard really doesn't deserve a vote if he did that.
