ok jim-bob, i'll bite. i'm not entirely sure how the game works, but i 
reckon it'll become obvious as we go along. hmm...to do it "desert 
island" style or just what i'm listening to lately...decisions, 
decisions. i'll tack some entries on at the end of this, but there's a 
lot of catching up to do in the meantime.

for starters, i've moved (a couple times) and am now at 4615 
brookeville rd, brookeville, md 20833. so if you could update your 
address for me, that'd be great. i still have a fondness for reading 
zeens the old fashioned way: on paper. call me old school. i've also 
gotten remarried (once) and changed jobs (about a half dozen times) 
since i checked in last (same sort of govt contracting business, 
though). haven't done much in-person gaming for years, but still amuse 
myself on the computer (mostly diablo2, starcraft, www.neopets.com 
(yes!) and www.nationstates.net).

time passes, and it's a bit weird having my rock'n'roll heroes dying 
from old age instead of the classic drug overdoses. sigh...george 
harrison, john entwistle, joe strummer, most of the ramones, stuart 
adamson (and just when i'd rediscovered the glory of big country, too), 
warren zevon.... all gone. wow. i particularly miss zevon. of all the 
musicians i've listened to, he was the one i most wished i could be. so 
many great songs about drug addicts, mercenaries, psychopaths, 
scoundrels, werewolves, and losers with the occasional splash of pure 
romance and heavy doses of morbid humor, sung in at least seven 
different languages. i don't think we'll ever see another one like 
warren. he went out with style too, leaving us with easily the best 
album ever by a musician with terminal lung cancer. the documentary of 
the making of the record is also worth picking up. never mind that it's 
a vh1 production, it's one of the best movies i've ever seen about 
living life right up to the very end.

speaking of movies (weren't we?)... i miss steve langley's "regular 
guy" movie reviews. they were clear and concise and very accurate (in 
other words, i usually agreed with him). only once did he truly miss 
the boat, with his comments on "heist". sorry, but that disaster was 
one of the worst squanderings of talent in movie history, with only two 
decent lines and one clever twist balanced against a dozen 
forehead-slappingly inexplicable happenings. (best line isn't "that's 
why they call it 'money'!", it's "don't you want to hear my last 
words?" "i just did" <blam!>) fred davis's movie list from a few issues 
back was a fun read. partly because it practically screams out "i was 
written by an old white guy!" and partly because he's got some 
interesting choices that i might have to catch up with sometime. and 
partly because he inspired me to think about what would be on my own 
list. the short list: "wizard of oz", "star wars", "casablanca", "pulp 
fiction", "seven samurai", "city lights", "notorious", "apocalypse 
now", "sunset boulevard" and "all that jazz". the longer (less orderly) 
list can be found on the web in the imdb at 
http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=17353394 - it's 1259 titles long 
and still growing. ah, imdb, no site is more dangerous for the movie 
trivia obsessed.

doug kent's saga has been a fascinating read. thanks for sharing, doug.

the endless baseball discussions, on the other hand...well...guess i'm 
blown away that anybody pays that close attention to it at the level 
you guys do. even though there are a couple minor league teams within 
easy driving distance of here, they're not exactly household names. 
instead the papers waste endless ink on the angelos-crippled orioles 
and the underdog (and also angelos-crippled) nationals. the nationals 
soap opera (is dc getting a team? are they ever going to sell them to a 
real owner? will they have a stadium? will they have parking garages? 
will it be back to the drawing board?) is so exhausting that i don't 
have any energy left to root for the actual team on the field. i wish 
them the best, though.

mini-tirade on the music industry time. i don't know about you, but i'm 
sick of the riaa and other powers that be whining about how internet 
piracy is killing their business. ummm...no. i don't believe that for a 
minute. either they're not doing their homework or else it's too scary 
to admit the truth. i think it's much more likely a combination of 
factors. first of all, all the old guys like me have finished replacing 
their vinyl with cd's by now. second, there's serious competition for 
entertainment $$$ with dvds and computer games that wasn't there 
before. third, radio isn't very good at breaking new bands anymore 
outside of a few narrow genres (country & rap). maybe that's because 
the music sucks (contrary to public opinion, i don't believe that's 
so), is too crass to listen to for extended periods (definitely), or 
it's just safer to play classic rock (yawn). fourth, it's too expensive 
for what you get. there's no way i'm going to pay a buck a song for a 
heavily restricted download that vanishes at the first disk crash. $15 
for a cd when i can get two great dvds for the same price? i'm gonna 
think twice. fifth, it's a lot easier to get perfectly fine used cds on 
amazon or half.com.

when it comes to free downloading (which i might have done a time or 
two), that's ideal for trying out new stuff, what radio used to be good 
for. the quality is too hit-or-miss to replace good ole cds. my feeling 
is that it's a net-positive for the bands, particularly bands that are 
still able to tour. oh well, there are plenty of great free music 
sources on the net these days that are perfectly legal. i've been 
playing around with pandora.com lately. it's an interesting concept, 
playing songs related by "musical genomes".

your discussion with mark lew on politics in the latest issue was 
interesting. unfortunately you're both totally wrong. :)

his administration was clearly taking on water early in the first term. 
their imperial presidency mentality clearly wasn't working with a 
divided congress, and it looked to me like w was gonna be a one-termer 
just like daddy. then 9/11 happened and that changed everything. 
suddenly our smirking frat boy president could jut out his chin, growl 
about how "we're gonna git bin laden, dead or alive" and look like a 
serious leader. the administration shrewdly seized on terror as the 
issue they could ride for every occasion ("don't question the 
president, or the terrorists win!", "pass tax cuts or the terrorists 
win!", "you're not safe voting for the other party or the terrorists 
win!"). it's natural for every president to try and amass as much power 
as possible, that always happens. but the circumstances, and the 
republican-owned house and senate allowed him to get away with it. it's 
impossible to blame everything that has gone wrong on bush, because his 
party leadership has been at least as responsible for the mess we're in 
as he is. i've never gotten the feeling that the republican brass 
particularly know or care what good governing is about. they're more 
interested in grabbing power for its own sake instead of using it 
responsibly. it doesn't appear to have dawned on them that 
bomb-throwing partisanship is only ok when you're not driving the bus. 
now after only four short years of republican domination it looks like 
they are going down hard. another week and we'll know for sure - it'll 
be interesting to see how it all shakes out. maybe the shameless 
republican big lie machine still works the magic, but it looks like the 
magic is wearing off. and this is without any particularly effective 
effort by the democrats - the gop is imploding all on its own. (fyi, 
no, i'm not a democrat and don't particularly care for them either.)

writing contracts doesn't make the republicans big spenders. their key 
is that they have perfected "borrow and spend" as an unstated 
philosophy while still aggressively slamming the dems for being tax and 
spenders, whether that's true or not. borrowing is painless...for now. 
and "now" is all that matters when the only goal is to be re-elected. 
maybe the debt will matter someday, maybe it won't, and how can that be 
measured anyways? ah, who cares, this current batch of elected 
officials will be dead before that happens. or global warming will have 
killed us all and it won't matter anyways. whatever. put it off til 
tomorrow. get rid of the death tax today or the terrorists win!

it's true that this administration controls information as tightly as 
any i've ever seen and stays distressingly "on message" even when the 
message is blatantly false. unfortunately saying that something is so 
often enough might work to get you elected, but it doesn't work so well 
as foreign policy.

i got a nice chuckle from the comments implying that the government 
should promote innovation. that's not like any government i've ever 
seen.

basically i'd say that bush has been a failure because he believes that 
he's divinely inspired. he can't admit that he's made a mistake because 
god is never wrong. so whatever the course is, we've got to stick to 
it. right off the cliff, if need be. and the people around him take 
advantage of that, because he just doesn't care about anything outside 
of his narrow focus: holy war against the terrorists and tax cuts for 
the wealthy.

i read recently that bush wants to be like reagan. and i'd say he's 
doing a great job of it. he's just like reagan, only without the charm.

ok, enough ramblings for now. maybe i should do this more than once 
every five years....



23 tunes (parts 1-9)
1. "want-ad blues", john lee hooker. sure, there are better-known 
hooker tunes, like "boom boom" and the classic "boogie chillun", but 
this is the one i keep coming back to. maybe it's the slyly suggestive 
lyrics sung in hooker's gravelly voice that's always just around but 
not quite on the beat that creates the magnetic tension. maybe it's the 
groove so deep "even a white person could get it". whatever. it's easy 
to listen to and hard to sit still for.

2. "sing, sing, sing", benny goodman. i hadn't heard this tune for ages 
til i heard los straitjackets play it in concert a couple years back. 
they ripped into it as a surf guitar instrumental and i kept thinking 
to myself, "i know this song, i know this song...what is it???" then it 
clicked and i was blown away. it's still as amazingly hot today as it 
was back in the big band days. gotta go back to the source and pick the 
original for being so timeless, even though the live los straitjackets 
version is about as good.

3. "blue on a green planet", big country. anthems...nobody does 
anthemic guitar rock as well as big country. big, loud, wailing guitar 
sounds. lyrics that sorta make sense if you don't think about them too 
deeply. drench with heartfelt emotion. crank it up to 11. repeat.

4. "instrumental introduction/don't look down", lindsey buckingham. the 
first time i heard this i just kinda shrugged and said, "eh". second 
time i thought it maybe wasn't such a weak song after all. third 
time...i couldn't take it out of the cd player for a month. it's 
beautifully played pop music that is just off-center enough to stay 
fresh no matter how often it's played.

5. "sweet marie" (live), hothouse flowers. this is about as close as it 
gets to putting pure emotion into song. it's a gospelly breakup song, 
sung to the girl that's just left him. he's still in love, but knows 
that it's not going to work. mildly irrational, sweetly romantic, 
wishing the best for the woman he loves but can't have. time to just 
carry on and savor the feelings because they're all you have left. i've 
been there.

6. "brand new cadillac", the clash. the second song on the greatest 
album of all time, the only band that matters covers an old rockabilly 
song and makes it all their own. propulsively danceable, rocking hard 
from start to finish. yeah, his girl has left him and ain't never 
coming back...but he still can't help but be impressed by the caddy.

7. "in my life", the beatles. a whole lifetime's love song compressed 
into less than two and a half minutes. sentimental without being sappy, 
simple, earnest, honest, concise and with room to spare for a piano 
solo. they don't make them like this anymore.

8. "the real me", the who. for a band that spent a great deal of time 
obsessing on identity issues, it doesn't get any more basic than this. 
hmmm...is he daring us to consider him, or pleading? either way, it 
looks bleak - just like the rest of the brilliant quadrophenia. and 
with entwistle's agile bass, "the best keith moon style drummer on the 
planet" and townsend's power chords playing against each other as much 
as with each other, form matches content perfectly.

9. "rev. jack and his roamin' cadillac church", by timbuk3. ok, so i'm 
a sucker for the big guitar playing the big groove. add a dash of wry, 
dry humor, a galloping drum machine, some wailing harp and barbara k's 
sublime harmony vocals and it's a tasty treat. too bad nobody ever 
heard this song because it's not on the cd with their "only" song. eden 
alley is a very strong cd throughout, and well worth a listen if you 
can still find a copy.


ok, enough for now! seriously!
