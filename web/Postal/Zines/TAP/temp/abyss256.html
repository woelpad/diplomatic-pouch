<br /><br />This issue is a bit of a rush job to make it out (at least so people see
it on E-Mail) before the Sweet Sixteen round of NCAA Tournament games starts.
I'll get caught up on anything I missed next time.

<p>
The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My Red Sox team is looking great for next year and so I'm very excited.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW NEW PLAYERS!!
Contact John Caruso at commishjohn of att.net or me for more details.
We have just one team left open at the moment.
LATE WORD: that might be taken....
Don't be left out.
Exhibition baseball play has started and then I'll get a chance
to see if I really have put together a contender.

Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hearby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a ``whenever''.
In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 
I think we really DO have Rip Gooch as the representative volunteer, more forthcoming
on that.

Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Bill, Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata,

This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous

That means that if Bill Quinn or Mark Berch or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub

I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Goes ON!!

<p>
This year a large number of
players went on to Round 2, before they narrowed to the Semi-Final Round
of Seven games to determine who goes to the Finals. 
Prominent semifinalists include: David Malloch (one of last year's finalists),
Paraic ``Fred'' Reddington (tall Irish elfin Diplomat as hard as nails!),
Jack Brawner (best known as Dick Martin's childhood pal), Paul Riley (GM
extraordinaire who proves he can play too!!), Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu
(I'm learning Norwegian so I can talk to him and Frank Johansen in their
own language... my first E-Mails to Joe were more or less understandable),
Yann Clouet (one of France's greatest exports to the English speaking world),
Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira (extremely, even by Dipping standards, arrogant
Brazilian... don't let him bowl you over), Thomas Franke (long acknowledged
as the best German player in the world, showing he's not washed up),
Stephen Agar (my <i>Diplomacy World</i> co-editor is showing he can
play the game with finesse!), Fearghal ``Twerg'' O'Donnchu (the Irish
wildman!!), Christian Dreyer (winner of tournaments and demo games,
extremely dangerous!), Brian Dennehy (wow, he is just a great player,
not second in any book of mine), Jody McCullough (yes, our very own Bay
Area whiz!), Frank Johansen (the aforementioned other Norwegian and the
President of the Norwegian Diplomacy Association), and Chetan Radia
(he of the only 18 center win at this summer's World DipCon). 
Expect this Tournament not to end until later this year.
The Semi-Finals are almost over.
The next tournament in the series will be WorldMasters 2002, starting sometime
next year.

<p>
Jody McCullough had the dubious distinction of being the first semi-final player
eliminated, after being jumped by Frank Johansen and Yann Clouet.
Watch out for Frank and Yann now!!!
They are jousting with each other as the Semifinal rounds work into their pressure
packed C-Diplo driven supply center count based ends.
Can Frank (who is leading) get into the Finals???

Hi.  Thanks again to my good friend Sharon, you've already heard that after
one day at home I was back in the hospital with pneumonia.  Ewww!  Yuck.
It's oldmonia now, but on the run.  I've added 7 new prescriptions to my

I'm now officially diabetic.  Just what you wanted to know, huh?  Anyway,
I'm back home recuperating and Cat (my cat) has already had a day of

Over the last two years,  I have would usually brought 4 CDs to work on Monday 
and taken them home on Friday. Those are the only ones I listen to all week.
There have been a number of CDs I thought I really liked, but I got 
tired of them. I've found certain CDs that I can listen to over and over 
during the same day without getting tired of them. This is tried and true 
music, not the new age crap that's good for 3 plays until you realize it's 
just a remake of all the other shit out there. What are these great CDs you 
ask?

<p>
#5  Frank Zappa   -  Strictly Commercial

<p>
#4  Government Mule  - Live with a little Help from our Friends

<p>
#3  Concrete Blonde  -  Recollections

<p>
#2  Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders  -  The Legend of Paul Revere

<p>
#1  Flo &amp; Eddie  -  The Best of Flo &amp; Eddie

<p>
Save your money people, these 5 CDs are a complete collection in themselves, 
no need for anything else, unless maybe a couple of things by combinations of 
Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young.

<br /><br /><b>Bob Osuch (Sat, 9 Mar 2002 10:22:04 EST)</b>

<p>
Hi Jim, Read the latest TAP, just a few comments.

<p>
The latest U2, <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>, is by far their best 
effort, solid throughout. My favorite track is ``In a Little While''. You also 
mentioned their appearance at the Super Bowl. I saw it too, 
<i>((Actually, as I mentioned, I DIDN'T see it.... but anyway....))</i>
and found it 
curious that Bono, long a detractor of American politics and foreign policy, 
would sell out by playing up to the crowd with the Old Glory lined jacket. 
Did you detect a bit of hypocrisy there?

<p>
As for my favorite albums, they're mostly from the seventies and early 
eighties. Since I abhor rap and most new wave stuff, there's little around 
today that I enjoy. One exception is the new Chris Isaak CD, <i>Always Got 
Tonight</i>. Very easy on the ears, if not a tad Orbisonesque in spots.
In no particular order my ten favorites are:

<p>
Spirit's <i>Twelve Dreams of Doctor Sardonicus</i>. This band featured guitarist 
Randy California...so what if you've never heard of him, he was among the 
most adventurous and innovative axemen of his time. Solid vocals and 
production, ahead of its time.

<p>
David Bowie's <i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i>. 
As the above, a theme album, includes ``Suffragette City" and Long John 
Baldry's ``It Ain't Easy". The latter doesn't fit and Bowie's version sucks, 
but otherwise a great album.

<p>
The Grateful Dead's <i>American Beauty</i>. This is my favorite Dead album, heads 
above the rest in my book. Not that Garcia and company put out classic stuff 
anyway, but this is their most listenable throughout. One of the few Dead 
albums that Nondeadheads would still enjoy.

<p>
King Crimson's <i>In the Court of the Crimson King</i>. Robert Fripp had a vision. 
Take the smaltzy crap that the Moody Blues called music, refine it and add a 
distinctively jazzy flavor, fill the void with real musicians (Fripp on 
guitar, Ian McDonald on flute and any other instrument except guitar and 
drums, Greg Lake on bass and Michael Giles on drums), and you have yourself a 
wonderful artistic success. This album never made the charts, too obscure and 
definitely different. Highly recommended.
<i>((I don't consider this obscure at all, but OK if you say so.
It does what it does better than almost anything else anyone has done.))</i>

<p>
The Rolling Stones' <i>Let it Bleed</i>. My favorite Stones album.

<p>
The Beatles' <i>Abbey Road</i>. My favorite Beatles album.

<p>
Lou Reed's <i>Rock and Roll Animal</i>. This album features the twin guitar work of 
Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter...overpowering to say the least. Arguably the 
best live album ever released. Reed's vocals are surprisingly strong. 

<p>
The Velvet Underground's <i>Loaded</i>. The Velvet Underground never made it big 
because Lou Reed had the balls to address social matter considered verboten 
by popular artists and society at large. Still, VU created many electronic 
innovations still prevalent in punk and New Wave music today. Try this one 
out and you'll see what I mean.

<p>
Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>. I suffered through Pink Floyd's earlier 
efforts in college. I suppose it was the original acid rock. If you enjoyed 
listening to a barrage of interesting noises (like a fly buzzing around for 
awhile in <i>Ummagumma</i>), they were for you. Many people think this is the band's 
first album, while in reality it's their eleventh. The rest is history.
<i>((Yeah, I listened to a bit of <b>Ummagumma</b> recently, just to see
what it sounded like to my ears today when I was ``testing out my record player'', 
and even though I am probably more
tuned in to interesting noises than you are, I found it profoundly 
uninteresting.
Say what you will, this changed music forever and it is precisely because
you can't see where it came from out of their own history that makes it
especially interesting.))</i>

<p>
Neil Young's <i>Harvest</i>. You either love him or hate him. I love him. Probably 
his best album, Young's not afraid to wear his feelings on his sleeve. So 
he's not the best musician, his haunting vocals and melodies more than make 
up for it.

<br /><br /><b>Brent McKee (Tue, 12 Mar 2002 16:31:03 -0600)</b>

<p>
Since Rick Desper sent you some Oscar predictions I might as well weigh in
with my own.  Of course I only went to one movie this past year (<i>Lord of the
Rings</i>) but that makes me as qualified as a lot of people to make
predictions.

<p>
Best Picture:  <i>Lord of the Rings, A Beautiful Mind, Gosford Park, Moulin
Rouge, In the Bedroom.</i>

<p>
Prediction:  <b>Not</b> <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.  I think it comes down to ``A Beautiful
Mind", ``Gosford Park" with ``In the Bedroom" as a long shot.  ``A Beautiful
Mind" has had a lot of buzz, not all of it positive recently (allegations
from Matt Drudge that it ``overlooked" John Nash's anti-Semitism) 
<i>((Which of course is total CRAP, since the whole subject is fully covered
in Sylvia Nasar's much more extensive and true biography which has been on
the Best Seller Lists and was published in 1998!!
Since Matt Drudge can't read, undoubtedly he didn't read the book....
one of the things that IS interesting about the 1950's is how Harvard during
that period was FIERCELY anti-Semitic and how it allowed MIT (where John Nash
was with all those Jews) and many other great universities like Chicago
to flourish by not being exclusionary!
But having that be conveniently forgotten to accuse someone like Nash of 
anti-Semitism is just amazing.
I hope that has blown over now.))</i>
but it is a Ron Howard film.  On the other hand ``Gosford Park" is lush and English and
fun - and a Robert Altman film.  
<i>((Yes, it really, really is, but I know because I've seen it.... ;-)  ))</i>
``In the Bedroom" has a shot because it is
very much an actor's movie.  I'm leaning towards Gosford Park.
<i>((I would be happy with either choice, but I'm still choosing A
Beautiful Mind.))</i>

<p>
Best Actor: Russell Crowe ``A Beautiful Mind", Sean Penn ``I am Sam", Will
Smith ``Ali", Denzel Washington ``Training Day", Tom Wilkinson ``In the
Bedroom".

<p>
Prediction:  Drop Penn: it's a gimmick part.  Drop Smith, because even
though he threw himself into the part and <b>is</b> a good actor when he's not
wasting his time with things like ``Independence Day" or ``Wild Wild West" I
don't think anyone could really capture Ali's character including Ali
himself (and he tried - see ``The Greatest").  I've liked Tom Wilkinson's
work since I first saw him in a British TV series called ``Peak Practice" and
this is a really powerful role so he's in with an outside chance.  Russell
Crowe is a controversial character in Hollywood, particularly after his
remarks after the BAFTA awards (British Film and Television awards) and
Denzel shows his acting chops playing totally against type in ``Training
Day".  Combine the two and Washington gets the award.
<i>((Perhaps, but Crowe's performance was so much more nuanced.
I think if they go on politics you're right though, so that's probably what
will happen....))</i>

<p>
Best Actress: Halle Barry ``Monster's Ball", Judy Dench ``Iris", Nicole Kidman
``Moulin Rouge", Sissy Spacek ``In the Bedroom", Renee Zelwegger ``Bridget
Jones' Diary".

<p>
Prediction:  Halle Barry would be a shoe-in for the Oscar any year but this.
The part is an extremely tough and unglamorous one and she pulls it off.
Still the winner is going to be Sissy Spacek because, as I've said, ``In the
Bedroom" is an actor's movie and more specifically is a showcase for her
acting which has matured a lot since films like ``Carrie" and ``Coal Miner's
Daughter".
<i>((Kidman's was a much edgier and difficult performance.
Spacek was just being Spacek.
We'll see if you're right.))</i>

<p>
Supporting Actor:  Jim Broadbent ``Iris", Ethan Hawke ``Training Day", Ben
Kingsley ``Sexy Beast", Ian McKellen ``Lord of the Rings", Jon Voight ``Ali".

<p>
Prediction:  Every year at the Oscars you get two things happening -
someone gets nominated for a life-time of accomplishments as well as this
year's film, and at least one of the Supporting nominees is really a lead
role nominated here because it will stand-out.  Ben Kingsley in ``Sexy Beast"
so stands out in this way that it isn't even funny.  McKellen is great, but
``Lord of the Rings" is going to be seen as an effects picture (incidentally
I see it winning any Oscars it gets in the technical categories).  I think
Broadbent, who has had several good parts this year including ``Moulin Rouge"
is in with a chance, but in the end I think Kingsley's brutal crook is going
to get it.

<p>
Supporting Actress:  Jennifer Connelly ``A Beautiful Mind", Helen Mirren
``Gosford Park",  Maggie Smith ``Gosford Park",  Marisa Tomei ``In the
Bedroom", Kate Winslet ``Iris".

<p>
Prediction:  Cancel out the two ``Gosford Park" nominations simply because of
the perception that the tend to split the vote.  Connelly is another of
those ``leads in the supporting category" and might very well win, but don't
be surprised if Marisa Tomei takes it.  Even though her role doesn't stand
up to Spacek's in terms of quality it still shows a range that she didn't
have in ``My Cousin Vinny" and she won an Oscar in that.

<p>
Best Director:  Ron Howard ``A Beautiful Mind", Ridley Scott ``Black Hawk
Down", Robert Altman ``Gosford Park", Peter Jackson ``Lord of the Rings",
David Lynch ``Mulholland Drive".

<p>
Prediction:  It comes down to Howard and Altman, with Scott having an
outside shot.  I think they'll give it to Altman, as much as a Lifetime
Achievement Award as for the movie, even though the movie is good.  I don't
think they want to end up with a situation like what happened with Hitchcock
who never got the big prize (of course Hitch was never even nominated).  I
also think there's a prejudice against Ron Howard for his youth that is at
least as big as the one against Spielberg that was only broken when he
created a movie that they couldn't ignore.
<i>((This is THE most fascinating category for me.
I can easily concoct arguments and scenarios where EACH of these wins.
I think Ron Howard will win on the ``political'' scenario where he just
is so likable.
Sorry, but he is.
But any of them could win and I'll be watchin'.))</i>

<p>
Animated Film:  ``Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius", ``Monsters Inc.", ``Shrek".

<p>
Prediction: ``Shrek".  I don't think that even Disney has any hope of
``Monsters Inc." winning - they certainly weren't pushing their nomination
with advertising dollars.  This whole category is a problem though.  ``Shrek"
is a good enough movie to have had a shot at a nomination in the Best
Picture category, following in a long line all the way back to ``Snow White"
in 1937. (Did you know that ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarves" held the box
office record until ``Gone With The Wind", and Disney wasn't charging the
higher road show prices for this movie?)  The problem was always that there
were never enough animated movies released to justify a new category (maybe
one a year, usually from Disney) the Academy was never going to nominate an
animated film - a CARTOON - for the Best Picture of the year.  You
couldn't even stick them in with the rest of the cartoons because the
category is very specifically Animated Short Subject, a distinction dating
back to the time when studios actually released animated - and live
action - shorts.

``Ice Age" - a movie

<p>
This is a kid's movie.  At least all the kids in the audience seemed to love 
it.  The story is a simple one.  A band of saber tooth tigers are out for 
revenge against the human tribe that has been killing them so effectively.  
The top cat decided that the perfect revenge would be to eat the baby child 
of the tribe's top hunter.

<p>
He assigns the task of bringing him the child to Diego (Dennis Leary).  In 
the mean time Manfred Mammoth and Sid the Sloth are traveling together.  The 
child falls into their care.  Sid wants to return the baby to its tribe.  
Manfred would just as soon do without either of them.  But when Diego tries 
to take the baby off their hands Manfred decides to keep him.

<p>
Lots of physical gags to do with snow and ice and taking care of the baby.  
The four bond.  The kids in the audience loved it.  So did I.

did Sid the Sloth had a perfect voice for the part - I heard him

He also said that none of the principles EVER were in the same room together.

``Showtime" - a movie

<p>
Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy, Rene Russo, and William Shatner (as himself).

<p>
De Niro is ``Mitch Preston" a police detective who is having a really bad 
night.  His drug sting is destroyed by `` `Ice' Trey Sellers" a patrolman who 
wants to be an actor, and several news coptors who come to hover over the 
action.  When a TV cameraman gets in his way while he is pursuing a man with 
a really big gun it is sort of the last straw.  Mitch shoots the cameraman in 
his camera.

<p>
Rene Russo is ``Chase Renzi" who is a producer looking for a show to produce.  
She sees in Mitch a real cop with more nitty and gritty than any television 
cop.  She convinces her cable TV outlet to pressure Mitch into doing a show.  
She and her cameras will follow him around 24/7 recording all the loose 
cannon things he does.

<p>
They decide that he needs a funny minority sidekick, and Trey sets up a fake 
crime to audition for the role.
<i>((This is TOTALLY obvious, but TOTALLY hysterical!!!))</i>

<p>
After following Mitch around for a while they discover that he is really 
dull.  Enter William Shatner to coach Mitch and Trey into being more exciting 
TV cops.
<i>((And Shatner nearly steals the movie at times.
He is playing himself and thus playing the actor that once was T.J. Hooker.
I never saw that show, but this came across PERFECTLY anyway.))</i>

<p>
In the meantime the man with the really big gun (it shoots Uranium bullets) 
is still out there.

<p>
This was a funny movie.  Not a funny cop movie so much as a funny TV cop 
movie.  Between Eddie Murphy over acting whenever he was `on camera' and De 
Niro getting stiff as a board at the same time, and Rene Russo making 
outrageous changes to Mitch's life, and Shatner as a cop coach, this was a 
funny movie.

``The Time Machine" - a movie

<p>
Once again Guy Pearce has blown me away.  His easily distracted absentminded 
professor is about as far from his degenerate nobleman "Count of Monte 
Cristo" character as you can get, and he is thoroughly convincing in both 
roles.
<i>((And don't forget his role in <b>Memento</b>!!!))</i>

<p>
Given that, the movie itself has a serious problem trying to decide what it 
is about.  It starts out being about Alex Hartdegan (Guy Pearce) inventing 
the time machine to go back in time to keep his one true love from dying.  
The original story as written by H. G.  Wells was about a young man who 
invents a time machine and travels far into the future to meet and rescue his 
one true love.

<p>
The movie tries to give us both.  That is one true love too many.  Alex is 
the type of character who only has one true love in a lifetime.  I can't see 
him giving up on trying to change the past just because the Uber Morlock 
tells him he can't.  The reason given was pretty lame.

<p>
Most of the movie was about the H. G.  Wells story.  If the writers had just 
left off the plot device to motivate the building of the machine it would 
have been a better movie.

<i>((Agreed.
This was OK, but not stellar.
Orlando Jones has a very small, but really fascinating role.

century New York was really good, though the need to transport the
location there was motivated by silly small tie-in issues in the later
time travel moments.))</i>

``We Were Soldiers" - a movie

<p>
Thanks to Tim King's review I decided to see this film.

<p>
Gripping comes to mind.  Searching for ways to describe the film.  Definitely 
gripping.  The movie makes no bones about showing that war is about blood and 
dying, blood and killing, but mostly about blood.

<p>
It starts with a small group of the French Army being ambushed by the 
Vietnamese.  The French had held Vietnam as an occupied country for around 
100 years.  In all that time the Vietnamese tried to drive them back out of 
their land.  According to the list that Hal Moore made the French made 
several mistakes.  They were not on their own terrain, they had poor 
intelligence about the location and strength of the enemy, they 
underestimated the quality of the enemy troops, they were badly outnumbered, 
they were massacred.

<p>
Hal Moore was selected to lead some of the first American troops into battle 
against the Vietnamese.  He was selected because he was considered to be the 
sort of leader who would lead his troops into the teeth of death without 
hesitation.  Brave but not too bright.  One who considered himself immortal.

<p>
His troops were green.  Even most of his officers were without any battle 
experience.  He was ordered into a battle where every item in the list he had 
made about the French was true.  He had no intelligence.  He was going into a 
place that the enemy had chosen for an ambush.  His troops were badly 
outnumbered, and the enemy had been fighting their war for over twenty years. 
They were battle hardened.

<p>
This movie is about what makes a warrior.  Hal Moore out thought and out 
fought the enemy general.  Despite having green men he managed to pull them 
together and keep more of them alive than was considered possible.  

<p>
Despite some really poor back echelon orders he managed to win the first 
battle that American troops fought in Vietnam.  

<p>
Gripping.

``Rollerball" a movie

<p>
Two movies actually.  The first ``Rollerball" was a big action flick in the 
mid-seventies.  The then story was about corporate Amerika controlling the 
world.  It did so in part with the media exploitation of a blood sport called 
Rollerball.  Part of the corporate premise was that there had to be lots of 
action and excitement but no stars.  Stars gave people heroes, and heroes 
might lead to unrest.  Not a truly logical premise.  When James Caan's 
``Jonathan E" became a star the powers that be upped the level of violence in 
order to take him out.  Of course he turned out to be tougher and faster and 
stronger and ... you get the idea.  So corporate Amerika didn't win and there 
was a hero.  No mention of subsequent unrest.

<p>
No mention either of why didn't corporate Amerika just retire him like it 
wanted to and be done with it.  After all, they did control the media.  Ship 
him off to a private hospital, tell his fans he needs the rest.  Later tell 
the fans he has decided to retire to a private south seas island.  Pictures 
of him, taken from a great distance frolicking on a beach.  End of problem.

<p>
``Rollerball 2002" is pretty much the same story without the obvious flaws.  
This time it takes place in the third world where Jean Reno (Alexi Petrovich) 
who doesn't own things, he owns the people who own things, is trying to 
launch Rollerball as the next big TV sport.  In order to boost ratings he 
arranges for players to have bloody accidents while on camera.  Chris Klein 
(Jonathan Cross) is an adrenaline junky who went to play rollerball when San 
Francisco got too hot for him following a skateboard luge race through 
traffic.

<p>
Jonathan is a natural athlete (a trait common to adrenaline junkies who live) 
and is a star.  Jean Reno loves that about him.  Jonathan raises the ratings. 
 But when Jonathan and friends discover that the accidents that have been 
removing teammates aren't accidents they decide to leave.  Reno can't let 
that happen.  It's as much an ego thing as an economic thing.

<p>
The movie itself is part movie, part music video, with strong heavy metal 
accentuating the action.  Lots of action.  Better end to the story, too.

``Resident Evil" - a movie

<p>
``Resident Evil" won awards as a video game.  Not my sort of video game.  It 
is a shooter.  I am not a shooter sort of game player.  Given that I was 
having thoughts of going out and getting the game while watching the movie.   

<p>
There is a story.  The evil corporation `Umbrella' is doing illegal 
experiments with gene manipulation and viruses.  Supposedly these are war 
related.  Considering that the gene manipulation creates monsters and the 
virus turns dead people into hungry zombies you have to wonder just who the 
war would be against.

<p>
Anyway, `Alice' (Milla Jovich) wakes up in luxury with no memory of who she 
is and what she is doing  there.  Milla Jovich managed to communicate the 
amnesia and confusion without saying a word.  I was impressed.

<p>
Soon there are black suited commando types crashing through windows, and much 
to her amazement, they seem to know who she is.  She still doesn't but she 
starts to get flashes of memory.

<p>
``The Red Queen" the AI computer that runs the secret research complex has 
shut it down and apparently killed the entire staff.  The commandoes are 
going in to shut down the computer.  They take Alice along.

<p>
I suspect the movie works a lot like the game.  There are lots of rooms and 
levels.  There are lots of monsters and traps.  

<p>
Good action.  The story is revealed in snippits while the action moves 
everyone along.  Not a great movie, but fun.

Dear Jim;

<p>
I have four tickets to the first round NCAA madness that will occur in
Sacramento next week.  Soon I'll know who's playing and decide whether to
sell or hold to see the games myself.  I bought them on speculation nearly
a year ago.  There are still tickets available for sale, however, so don't
know if there will be any purchasers.

<p>
I became a H.S. basketball official this year - men's and women's freshman
and JV games.  I had a lot of fun, made a little money, learned a lot and
felt good about giving something back to a great sport for kids.  Because
of that, and my son's abilities, I've paid a little more attention to the
collegians this year.  I watched college games while biking on a
semi-recumbent bike with a whistle in my mouth, practicing blowing my
whistle, dropping it out of my mouth and raising up either my clenched fist
or my open hand (foul or violation).

<p>
I've seen most of the top ranked teams at least once, and don't like the
anyone of them completely.  Gonzaga can't make it through.  I am guessing
Duke will, but would bet on ``the field" against any of the favorites.

<p>
Music.  I saw a number of live performances this year, almost all in
little bars.  I did see the Counting Crows (nearly my all-time favorite Pop
album) and they were at a spread out winery venue and it was awful.  I saw
Melissa Etheridge alone and she took the top performance and most enjoyable
show awards this year and for quite a few years back.  She was dynamite.

<p>
Of the off-label, little, blues or local bands - none stands out as one
who will make it through or greater than the fun of the moment.

<p>
I can't believe I've seen all of the oscar nominated best pictures other
than Tolkien's (bad mistake when a kid to avoid the books because I thought
they were a fad like Harry Potter or the Smurfs.  Not quite as bad as
delaying to learn how to play frisbee because it also was a fad).  A
Beautiful Mind was my favorite and had the greatest effect on me.  In the
Bedroom was so dark and non-entertaining until thinking and discussing it
later that I can't believe it will win.  While I love Altman, and this was
his best in a while, I can't believe it will win either.  Which means that
Lord of the Rings or A Beautiful Mind.  I like the thought that ABM will
win and then Denzel will win Best Actor.

<p>
Interesting story about the collegians and brain radiation.
<i>((Thanks.... I thought YOU would appreciate it most.))</i>	

<p>
I was glad to read something from Mark Lew, although such a little about
politics and only a touch of the Byzantine!  Billy Beane is great and the
A's are great for all of the reasons mentioned in his letter, plus they use
the supplemental draft picks for losing free agents very wisely.
I listen to a lot of sports radio talk shows and lots of baseball games
(both the A's and the Giants) and knew nothing, nor care nothing, if Billy
Beane is gay.

<p>
The Giants have some awesome broadcasting personnel with John Miller back,
McCarver joining them and the former voice of the Padres and Marlins
returning to the Bay.  Plus, they have put their team together to win this
year.  It should be a fun year for baseball in NorCal again this year. 
Even with Jeff Kent breaking his wrist while washing his car - falling off

<p>
Jim;

<p>
I was thinking about the email I sent to you regarding music experiences
of the past year, specifically the comment about the Counting Crows concert
and local musicians.  
I believe that there are only two things that I can control in life.  One
is my attitude.  The second is my attributions - primarily unto others,
such as attribution of intention of their actions, their attitudes, etc. 
These beliefs have grown in substantiation over my decades reading about
the human brain, consciousness and emotions.  The most recent ``best" book
in this evolution was ``The General Theory of Love," by Lewis, and two
others.  

<p>
As such, any given band was neither great nor terrible, my experience was
great or terrible.  In general, I do not have a great experience in a large
venue.  Melissa Etheridge was in a venue of about 5,000 and that is way
pushing the boundaries - yet she captivated even at that distance.  U2
could not captivate me at stadium seating distances and venues - no matter
whether they played greatly or not, so I prefer to listen to them on a CD.  

<p>
I did not wish to denigrate any local bands I saw in small clubs - and the
times I experienced which were fabulously wonderful.  Sort of like Erin
singing while looking in your eyes.  I know you share much of my sentiment
in this regard, so onward.

<p>
Bush announcing 30% tariffs on steel imports?!?  We have a secret, shadow
administrative government in bunkers that the Congress doesn't know
about?!?  We disallow people kidnapped from their homeland who we house in
miniscule cages the rudiments of their religion by banning sheets into
turbans?!?  We are going to pay peanut farmers $1.3 billion to accept $3
billion in subsidies to not grow peanuts?!?  What will I have to eat now on
short airplane flights?  I have trouble attributing anything much rationale
into the Cheney-Dubya government other than, get what you can get for the
military-industrial complex while the getting seems good.

stone by attending DipCon in Chapel Hill.

Jim; A lovely spring weekend here.  

<p>
On Friday night I went to the Fillmore to see ``Hot Tuna."  Mostly to get a
poster since  their first album is in my shortest stack of CDs - the ones I
listen to the most.  Cassady and Kaukonen have been playing together for
approximately 40 years and as a duet for at least 35.  That alone was
fairly remarkable.  My girlfriend was a negative contribution to the
context - telling me that her stomach was bothering her, she doesn't like
feeling closed in by people (new to me) and that she had blocked out the
part that we would have to stand up during the performance.  Added to that
was my sore tooth, just having eaten my first meal after my first ever
colonoscopy (screening, no tics, no polyps, all normal - thank you.  Highly
recommended for everyone 50 and over at least every 10 years) and the
nearly non-existent eye contact between the performers and the crowd. 
Positive contexual aspects were lots of happy people, lots of
motion/dancing and being within 40 feet of the stage.

<p>
Before the first set, there was soft music in the background that I
identified as Tom Waits.  I wondered who picks the music and if there was a
connection such as Marin County.  During the first set I thought I heard
Jorma (K) playing some rifts from Ali Farka Toure.  During intermission I
told Patty about my perception and asked if she had noticed.  Then I
realized that the intermission music was Ali Farka Toure.  I had taken her
to see him/them last year.  And I still wonder who chooses the background
music.

<p>
I realized while waiting for the show that I had neglected to mention
``Mississippi Radio" as my local favorite band and the band I've heard many,
many times this year.  The guitar player loves the blues and covers many
styles.  He is also the co-owner of the bar and with his brother, another
in SF.  I think he could move on in the world of music but never will.

<p>
On the subject of Sir Isaac Newton (sort of) I saw an 
excellent documentary on Archimedes on the BBC last night 
which I hope makes it over to the US.  
I always knew he was a brilliant and innovative mathematician 
but the documentary last night indicated that he had practically invented 
calculus 2,000 PLUS years ago but his writings were obscured by monks 
who recycled his parchments for what they considered more important work. 
Luckily through modern techniques we have been able to read Archimedes' 
writings underneath the scribblings of the monks.
The programme wondered how different the world would have been had this 
information been available in the Renaissanace period.  
I expect Da Vinci might have had a passing interest. Ditto Sir Isaac.

NCAA picks

<p>
Well, here they come.   The West is stacked! 

<p>
I think it's best to start with a vague idea of which teams <i>could</i> be
Final Four teams, and which <i>could</i> win it all.
<i>((Agreed, I did that and came up with the following.... in the
South obviously Duke should be the favorite, but I am convinced they 
will lose in the Regional Final, but to who?
Why NOT Alabama?
I am going to bet ``yes'' on Brandin Knight's injury for Pitt and count
them out, though Alabama is going to have to get by a tough Kent State
team.  No one else there can beat Duke (though I really like Penn!!).
In the West, I like Oklahoma, Cinci, and Ohio State as possibles for the
Final Four, but Ohio State will have to get by Missouri (who will surprise
Miami) and Cinci will have to get by a tough matchuup with that team
or even UCLA or Miss.  Gosh, that bracket is TOTALLY stacked.
I like Oklahoma to keep their Conference Tournament momentum going.
In the Midwest, I am very confident of Oregon making it by anyone who
they will face.  I like W. Kentucky to knock off Kansas, but if not them,
Florida or Illinois so they won't even face Oregon.
Then the East is SO obviously UConn and Maryland's to win or lose.
That Regional Final will be the Great Regional Final war that will
recall Duke/Kentucky and other famous battles over the years.
I think Maryland will get by that to take it all.))</i>

<p>
West:  Cincinnati should cruise to the Sweet Sixteen.  Picking 8/9 games is
pointless - you might as well flip a coin.  Buckeyes should cruise past 
Davidson.  Buckeyes vs. either Miami or Mizzou is intriguing - I will play it 
safe and go with OSU.  I still can't figure out if Mizzou will beat Miami - 
that's a good upset to go with.
<i>((I had that one....))</i>

<p>
The other half of the West has easy 1st round games to pick: Gonzaga over 
Wyoming, Arizona over UCSB, Xavier over Hawaii, and Oklahoma over Arizona.
The winner of the West could be Arizona, Oklahoma, or Cincinnati.  Gonzaga
would likely have to beat all three of them.
<i>((I liked Gonzaga to beat Arizona, but they didn't get there to do it.
Oklahoma will make short work of Arizona who will be REALLY, REALLY
strong next year.))</i>

<p>
Poor Gonzaga some people.  After all, they were rated in the Top Six.
The question, though, is why?  Why were they rated so highly?  They didn't beat 
anybody of notice.  They lost to both Marquette and Illinois, the only 
moderately good teams they played.  Connecticut played a much tougher schedule, 
and managed to beat some good teams (Pitt, Arizona, Notre Dame,...).  But they 
were ranked 24th at the end of the season?  What's up with that?
<i>((In retrospect these words were very, very wise.))</i>

<p>
Poll voters are very lazy.  

<p>
Anyway, Arizona is too good to lose to Gonzaga.  I think.  In any case, Oklahoma 
is the real team to beat in the whole region.  I take Oklahoma over 'Zona and
Cincinnati over OSU in the Regional Semis, and then Oklahoma to the Final Four.
<i>((Agreed.
I had that before the tournament started and I'm still there, but I totally
blew Gonzaga as an upset special.))</i>

<p>
Midwest:

<p>
So, given his most talented team ever, how is Roy Williams going to screw up 
this year?  Will it be Western Ky. in the second round?  Illinois in the 3rd?
Oregon or Miss. State in the Regional Finals?  I don't know, but I know they'll 
screw up somehow.  Taking that as a given, I'll take the Ducks to the Final 
Four.  Only upsets of note are Pepperdine over Wake and W. Ky over Stanford.
BC against Texas is very tempting, but I'll pass.  
<i>((I thought it WOULD be W. Kentucky, but once Stanford won, I knew
Stanford couldn't beat Kansas, so it's for Illinois to do it.
I know BC well, and I knew that was NOT an upset special.
I should have seen that Texas would also beat Miss. St. but Texas WON'T 
beat Oregon.))</i>

<p>
East:

<p>
Why did UConn get put in the regional with Maryland?  Boo-hoo, I thought they 
would match up much better against Duke.  I like Maryland this year.  A lot of 
talent, quickness, and size.  Early upsets?  I'll take the Salukis of So. 
Illinois over Texas Tech and Michigan State over NC State.  Go with Maryland,
Marquette, Georgia, and UConn in the Sweet Sixteen, and Maryland over UConn to 
reach the Final Four.  Georgia/UConn could be a very interesting game.
<i>((Yeah, I actually think seeded differently I would have picked Maryland
and UConn to play a great national championship game, but we have the game 
to look forward to on March 24, Sunday, in the Carrier Dome.
Be there or be square, greatest game of the year for sure.
I got the Salukis to go Sweet 16 and then lose to UConn.
Calhoun has his team SO tournament ready.
He has to with Auriemma going with the Women's team for it all!!
I also thought Marquette would go Sweet 16, but Kentucky is 
surprising me. 
Could they screw us both up and beat Maryland??? 
Nah, but if they do then we can both root for UConn!!!))</i>

<p>
South:

<p>
There is nothing to stop Duke here.  Can you see Alabama beating Duke in a 
regional final?  I can't.  Maybe Pitt if Brandin Knight hadn't hurt himself last 
week.  But when it comes to tournament time, Duke has three tremendous 
advantages: (a) the best coach, (b) the best point guard, (c) good veteran 
teamwork.  

<p>
Early upsets?  I'll go with Kent State over Ok. State and Utah over Indiana.
'Bama, Pitt, USC, and Duke roll into the Sweet Sixteen.  USC could give Duke 
headaches, but the Dukies will prevail over them and over 'Bama to reach the 
Final Four yet again (much to everyone's annoyance).
<i>((I'm now firmly on Brandin Knight's and Pitt's back.
They can do it, I hate Duke, I hate Duke, I hate Duke.
Jason Williams did make some free throws, can he keep it up?
No.))</i>

<p>
Final Four:  Duke vs. Oklahoma is intriguing.  I'll go with Duke because of
their experience.  (Actually, I think the Bearcats would have a better chance 
against Duke, but Bob Huggins is one of those coaches whose teams always 
underwhelm in the tournament.)  Other side:  Maryland over the Ducks simply 
because the Terps have too much talent.  

<p>
That leads to the long-anticipated final: Duke vs. Maryland.  Maryland is the 
better team, but Duke is better-coached and more consistent.  I think Maryland 
will throw the monkey off the back and win it.  
<i>((And I think Maryland will beat Oklahoma.))</i>

<p>
In making my picks, I try to keep in mind who's been in the tournament recently, 
which coaches are known choke-artists, and which coaches tend to do very well.
Good tournament coaches include Jim Calhoun, Mike Kryzwewski, John Chaney (alas,
not in), Rick Majerus, Rick Pitino (another miss), Tubby Smith and whoever
is coaching Gonzaga.  Weak coaches include Lute Olson, Jim Boeheim (a pass this
year), Roy and Gary Williams.  

<p>
Oh heck, I'll pick Gonzaga over Arizona after all.   That game is driving me 
nuts!

<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Mon, 18 Mar 2002 15:46:36 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
- Bob Huggins said that UCLA didn't play like an 8 seed.  If that's true,
then Missouri hasn't played <b>anything</b> like a 12 seed!  I think Mizzou should be 
favored over UCLA, and could give Oklahoma a very good game.  Kudos to Goz
and Tim Richardson for nailing the UCLA over Cincinnati upset.

<p>
- Kansas really looked quite vulnerable against Holy Cross.  I could see anybody 
coming from the Midwest, except Texas.  I had initially picked Oregon, and then 
reverted to going with Kansas, the ``safer" pick.  My Midwest bracket didn't
do so bad.

<p>
- Duke looked very beatable against Notre Dame, a team which was, IMHO, 
underseeded.  But I'm still not that impressed by the other teams in their
bracket.  I think there are probably 8 teams in the West who would have been
more of a threat to Duke than the three left in the South, and that includes, of
course, all four that are left in the West.  Having seen Kent State play so well 
thus far, I would favor them over Pitt, a team which really didn't face a lot of 
competition this year.  
<i>((No, no, no. 
You didn't see enough of Brandin Knight.
He is a ``take the team on the back and ride me'' player.
That's why I was so worried about the injury.
And Pitt's defense might be the best in the country.))</i>

<p>
- Maryland is still the strongest overall team in the tournament.  I think they 
have too many weapons for Kentucky, and I'll stick with my original prediction 
that they beat UConn in the Elite Eight.  That particular game, if it happens, 
could represent great problems for me.  I <i>should</i> root for UConn, but I picked
Maryland in all my pools (and got some flak for it from the local Maryland 
alums, but hey, I want to win the pool.)

<p>
- All four of my Final Four teams are still around.  I'll stick with my earlier 
predictions: Duke over Oklahoma, Maryland over Kansas, and then Maryland over 
Duke, but if I could reconsider, I would pick Oklahoma over Duke (but not 
Maryland).  You're right to say that Duke is very vulnerable.  They simply don't 
have much of an inside game, and I can't believe that Jason Williams is such
a poor free throw shooter.  

<p>
-ESPN.com has a ``second chance" tournament which people might want to get into.
It involves only picking the games from here on out.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>

<p>
<i>((Does ESPN have that ``second chance" tournament up yet?  It didn't
last I looked.  I have been VERY, VERY poor this year at my picks.
And I say that even if I ultimately get UConn on the Women's side
and Maryland on the Men's side right.
I really shouldn't have gone with the ``Knight is injured" crowd
on Pitt, I think now that they are going Final Four as the fourth
team to go with Oregon, Maryland, and Oklahoma.  I didn't get my
final picks into the ESPN site, as you probably saw, but my last
few changes didn't help me much.  I did want Oregon, Maryland,
Oklahoma and Alabama to be my final four picks and only Alabama
is out there.  After studying Cincinnati it became clear that
I was overrating them.
Thanks, Rick, one more update on Eric Klien, and then I'll probably
let this rest for awhile....
don't bet against Mr. Klien!!!))</i>

We at The Lifeboat Foundation, a non-profit corporation based in Minden,
NV, have completed our corporate organization.  Having done so, we also
launch the very first issue of Lifeboat News.  Thanks for subscribing.

WORLD NEWS

<p>
ITEM 1: An innocent sounding article on Reuters called ``Cyberbabes and
Orgasmatrons Heat Up the Future" pointed to predictions by a respected
British Telecommunications white paper that New York City and Washington
D.C. could be nuked at any time by terrorists and that within three
years we could run into difficulties such as ``accidental creation of
lethal organism during research", ``deliberate biotech self-destruct by
malicious biotech researcher", and ``terrorism rises beyond capability of
government systems".  For further information go to:
www.btexact.com/white_papers/downloads/WP106.pdf

<p>
ITEM 2: On March 3rd, The Washington Post reported that ``Alarmed by
growing hints of al Qaeda's progress toward obtaining a nuclear or
radiological weapon, the Bush administration has deployed hundreds of
sophisticated sensors since November to U.S. borders, overseas
facilities and choke points around Washington."  And on March 1st, The
Washington Post reported that the Bush administration had activated for
``the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age" contingency plans to
maintain a shadow backup government in underground bunkers away from
Washington to prepare for Washington being nuked.

<p>
THANKS!

<p>
The Lifeboat Foundation is undertaking an enormous project and even if
we had a billion dollar donation tomorrow, it would still be many years
before we could implement our solutions for human life preservation.
Especially considering that the technologies necessary to those
solutions have yet to be invented.  However, thanks to donations from
our many generous contributors we are able to move forward in our
attempts to improve the chances of human survival in an uncertain
future.  Your support is appreciated.

<p>
As an extra bonus to our farsighted supporters, we have implemented an
exclusive VIP section available on the bottom menu of every page.  This
section contains materials that include developmental images of our
computer engineered Space Ark I.  To access this section you must enter
the required VIP codes.

<p>
PRESS

<p>
We have been covered by many news organizations including Yahoo!, CBS,
and NBC.  However, our next objective is to receive coverage on the Art
Bell show.  If you'd like to help, we recommend that you and your
friends e-mail artbell of aol.com and artbell of mindspring.com requesting
that the Art Bell show cover The Lifeboat Foundation (lifeboat.com) in a
future broadcast.

<p>
LIFEBOAT MODEL

<p>
We are rapidly moving towards getting a computer engineered model of
Space Ark I.  We are working with CAD artist, David Pitzer of Mr Science
Co., on our first such model.  Mr. Pitzer's rendering of the
International Space Station is the most frequently reproduced AutoCAD
image in history.  The design of Spark Ark I is a major engineering
project and we've had to take into account many factors in its design,
such as the results of growing plants in microgravity based on the
results of experiments aboard Mir.

Dear Jim-Bob,

<p>
The story about the lawyers and the cigars can't be true.  The standard
fire policy language excludes any loss that is the result of an intentional 
act on the insured's part (most types of coverage have such a clause in
the standard form.)  It's hard to imagine that an underwriter would have
written an endorsement to eliminate that exclusion.

Official standby for the game is David Hood.
HELP!!!
Will this ever begin?? 
You lawyers are going to have to scour the depths of the sewers.... i.e.
the courtrooms and law offices of the world... and find me some lawyers 
to play this game, before the NO lawyers game finishes!

<p>
Note that Buddy's ``sample game'' of Air Sea Diplomacy starts in this issue.
I do have a copy of the rules and I will print them next issue.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Thanks, Rick, you're in, obviously.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  GM): Gee, thanks for this position. 

<p>
(BOOB to RICK): You're quite welcome, it's yours. 

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  AUSTRIA): Since I was shanghaied into playing this game, 
I'm not going to make any attempt to contact other than via email.  
But I will do a little better than only public press.  But, to answer
your questions in that letter:

<p>
 1) Yes

<p>
 2) Yes

<p>
 3) No

<p>
 4) apricot jam

<p>
 5) Yes, he is a little funny looking

<p>
 6) but no, I've never thought he had bad breath.  

<p>
 7) Naomi Watts, of course
<i>((Of course....))</i>

<p>
 8) Yes

<p>
 9) Maybe; and

<p>
 10) whistling ``Bridge on the River Kwai"

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  GERMANY): Just what are you doing
in Sweden anyway?  Shouldn't you be writing me or something?

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  ITALY): Hi there!  Germany doesn't seem very friendly to me,
does he?

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  FRANCE): One of you guys is going to have to fill me in on
the goings-on.  

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  GM): This morning, I heard Ashley Judd call up the Car Talk
guys on NPR.  And then, a few hours later, I saw her rooting for
Kentucky as they made the Sweet Sixteen.  Coincidence?  I think not! 

<p>
Silencio.

<p>
Silencio.

<p>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): Are those your moments of silence for Ashley Judd, 
Click and Clack, the fate of Tubby Smith, or the knuckleheads in this
game???

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  BOARD): Any of you knuckleheads going to DixieCon/DipCon?

<p>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): I should have known.... hey, you E-Mail types, how
do you manage to play 48 hour games when you can't communicate in 
three WEEK games??
And EVERYONE should go to DixieCon, even if I don't manage to make it.

<p>
(RUSSIA - &gt;  TURKEY): Tim, I suggest going to your Diplomacy encyclopedia
and scanning the `Lep' pages.  I hope you have had the sense
to build a fleet on the Med.  

<p>
(TURKEY to ALL): This space should be filled with something
witty, but I've just had 4 finals in 3 days, so I'm too tired to write
it.

<p>
(BOOB to ALL): OK, we'll let the blurbist fill the witticism
quotient then.
Though clearly Tim has his encyclopedic knowledge straight.
If you guys don't keep up with the Blurbist I'll have to give
you all two minutes in the penalty box for tripping!

<p>
(BLURBIST to HIGH-BROW LITERARY CIRCLES): I was recently
reviewing Harold G. Henderson's four rules for
composing classic Japanese haiku-laid out in his
``Haiku in English," Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1967-
when it struck me that the haiku is the perfect
poetical forum for Diplomacy. 

<p>
Why? Well, let's review good Mr. Henderson's rules.
The first one, dictating the 5-7-5 syllable/line
format, is largely irrelevant to Diplomacy (although I
am sure Pope Fool could spot some nonsense on its
relevancy). 
<i>((Did you mean ``spout''?  Watch out, Fool needs
LITTLE provocation to go off on a major league tangent.))</i>

<p>
However the second rule states that the haiku
``contains at least some reference to nature (other
than human nature)." This may also seem hardly
relevant until we read ahead and learn that: ``The
reference to nature is not always direct. Classical
haiku almost all contain so-called `season words'
which may be connected be connected with a particular
season only by convention."

<p>
``Season words" . . . Well, is not Diplomacy constructed
about the four seasons? And are not ``season words"
something of which the vernacular of Diplomacy is
chock-full? For instance, ``build" is obviously a
season word for ``winter. Also, ``stab" could be
considered a season word for fall, as it is generally
held that spring stabs are poor form. For summer,
perhaps ``regroup" as spring losses are exploited for
fall gains, and for spring perhaps ``depart" as all the
newly mustered units bid farewell to their loved ones
back in the home centers.

<p>
However, as mentioned by Mr. Henderson, season words
are the product of convention. Once the genre of
``Diplomacy Haiku" begins to flower, the conventions
that bud may present us with words that are not
immediately evident, but still powerfully evocative of
the game's cycles.
<i>((Oooooeeeee, I'm so deep now that I'll never 
claw my way out.
This is incredible stuff!!!))</i>

<p>
Henderson's third rule reads that Japanese classical
haiku ``refers to a particular event (i.e., it is not a
generalization.)" War (and war games) are won by
generals, not by generalizations. What more perfect
format then with which to laud or lambaste our
general's fortunes in battle?

<p>
The fourth rule, however, narrows our rejoicing or
regret to their immediacy, commanding that the haiku
``presents that event as happening *now*-not in the
past." The impression must be conveyed of the
battlefield witness crystallizing the chaos before him
into a readibly recognizable emotional note.

<p>
``Emotional" because, as defined by Mr. Henderson, the
objective of the classical haiku in following the four
tenets outlined above is to be ``a record of a
moment of emotion in which human nature is somehow
linked to all nature." In the case of Diplomacy Haiku,
that nature to which the writer seeks a connection is
the nature of the game: loss, gain, tactics,
treachery, etc.
<i>((But that's right, Diplomacy is THE game that is
absolutely and profoundly all encompassing in that way.
Diplomacy IS haiku!))</i>

<p>
Allow me, then, to unveil this new genre by attempting
a haiku for each of the powers in ``I Can't Find My
Money." I shall limit the scope of my narration to the
Fall 1901 season. Perhaps future seasons will inspire
other writers to further explore the frontiers of this
exciting literary movement.
<i>((I hope so!))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) We finally got all of you in here, and I guess you seem to understand
the rules. 
Now things get tricky.
In the Fall, you can SKIP over all of those black holes created by your nukes.
This creates all sorts of fun stuff.
There still is a summer press only deadline.
Ask questions if you are unsure about what moves are possible.
Just as a check, so you know what one possible set of moves is, 
Jack can use all four of his units and attack Sweden with three supports.
Sweden is considered on the shores of the Black Sea, even though
the Black Sea is no longer there now - actually Sweden is on the 
shores of the Eastern Mediterranean or the Mid-Atlantic as well...
Thus F Sev can move to Sweden.
And, sorry, Lee, you miss out on all the fun.
All three of your units are annihilated, so you have to wait until 1902,
when you will be playing Russia.  
We'll all move DOWN the list of countries, so feel free to begin to play 
ahead.
26 centers left up for grabs, 20 of them home centers and
owned at present, and
six neutrals that could all be taken (only one of those unopposed),
if I've counted right.

<p>
2) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot, see
Prussia above.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FLAPJACK to JIM-BOB): Hey I got flapjack of comcast.net as an address too....woohooo!!!
Do you have to watch the movie Dr. Strangleglove while doing your moves. 
(Extra credit to anyone who knows the subtitle....)
<i>((Oh, I just love the bombs....))</i>

<p>
(SARA-GM):  Hi sweetie!

<p>
(BOOB to SARA): I didn't mean YOU were the bomb that we learned to love.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-MRS. SANDY): See how nice I am...I only nuke putrid neutrals 
who deserve to die. The future is to the strong...

<p>
(FLAPJACK-SGT. SCHULTZ): I bet your coffee pot isn't a bug for 
Klink's office right? 
By the way if we work together I can have LeBeau make you a nice strudel. 
No nukes is good nukes dude.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-KAISER HARRY): You know I love you man...that's 
why I want you to go West. 
I love you so much I want to share you with the other players.

<p>
(PAUL to GM):  Maybe this game should be renamed to be:
The George W. Bush Axis of Evil.  Ridicule for the ridiculous.

<p>
(BOOB to PAUL): Sounds like it might be a good name for the next game.

<p>
(ITALY to THE WORLD):  Well if someone at talked to me... I would not have
hit almost everyone.

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): But maybe they were talking ABOUT you.... you got 
fragged.... but don't worry, it's early yet.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-KING LEE): You're gonna keep Kaiser John busy, 
right...... no wait the other way..... damn... foiled again!

<p>
(FLAPJACK-KING PAUL): I love you too so but I heard Germany and France 
hate you. Hey, I'm trying to help.

<p>
(LONDON):  I seem to always get burned (playing as England or France) if I
don't cover the Channel.  Well, it's covered.  I expect that Nth might 
be nuked, but cheerio here I go....

<p>
(FLAPJACK-JIMBOOB): Am I loved or what????

<p>
(BOOB to FLAPJACK): You surely are loved.... just look at how you got EVERYONE to
nuke the non-supply center provinces, thus neutralizing your nuclear deficit.
Now we've got lots of units and lots of centers to go for.
Have at it!!!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): An introduction for those new to this program. On 3 
February an AA lady with 5 years sobriety died from liver cancer, leaving 7 
cats behind. As part of the rescue mission, I was assigned two of the 
orphaned cats, Pearly and Tyler. They arrived 5 February and promptly went 
into hiding. I was told to leave out food and water, clean the litter trays 
daily, and wait for them to come out of their own free will.

<p>
For a few weeks things seemed OK. It would seem as if Pearly was using the 
downstairs litter tray and Tyler the upstairs litter tray. Small amounts of 
food were eaten, and they must have been drinking the water, since the 
results showed up in the litter trays.

<p>
Until last week. All of a sudden most of the can of Friskies Cat Food I was 
putting out every evening was being eaten by morning, and the results were 
evident in the upper litter tray. I have also glimpsed Tyler at night when I 
woke up suddenly. He was scampering out of my bedroom. I talked with some cat 
friends, and they think Tyler is now hiding under my bed in the box springs 
during the daytime. Of course I have been leaving the bedroom door open to 
allow him in and out. It was suggested that I NOT to try to find Tyler under 
the bed, but just let him be and let him continue to adjust to his new home. 
So that is what I am doing. 

<p>
Also in the last week, the lower litter tray stopped being used. All efforts 
to locate Pearly have failed. I have come to the conclusion that in spite of 
our best efforts, she somehow slipped out of the house. My two house mates 
have assured me that they have taken all precautions when entering and 
leaving. Still, there has been no activity in the lower litter tray for one 
week, and I have lost hope. Sunday morning, when I realized that, I suddenly 
broke down and went on a crying jag that lasted three hours. I had, of 
course, been warned by my counselors that I would encounter mood swings now 
that I no longer had any testosterone in my body to act as a buffer. Still, 
it took me completely by surprise. Another thing to get used to and accept.

<p>
I called Kay about this today, and she informed me that the other five cats 
were still in the process of being socialized to accept being handled by 
human beings. So it seems as if Tyler and Pearly had not been handled much by 
their former owner either, which is why Tyler is still in hiding. This may 
take a lot more time and patience then I originally thought it would.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.
There really isn't any excuse except that I can't count, but the last
two slots should have replenished with an 8 and a 10 respectively.
This is corrected above.
But Alice replenished correctly, didn't she?  Note
that she did NOT Break Away last turn, she was on 81 and Rhombus
was on 80.

<p>
3) Rectangle and Square are guaranteed 4 points and 3 points 
respectively for Sprint points next time.
Who will step up and grab those last two slots?
Beaver looks good for one of them.....

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TOM to BOOB): Looks to me like the riders on 55 and 54 should 
have replaced with 8 and 10 - or, have I been looking at too much snow?

<p>
(BOOB to TOM): No, you're right, see above.

<p>
(ALICE to PRESCOTT):  Whee! Company!  May I draft you for another turn?

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  ALICE):  Are you ten feet tall?

<p>
(QUABS to BOOB):  I attribute my relative success in ``Tour de Farce''
(the Breaking Away game run by David Partridge in <i>Tinamou </i>)
mainly to the fact that <font face="symbol"></font
> for some reason Tom Howell is not
playing!

<p>
(BRIT PACK - FLIGHTLESS BIRDS): I hope you aren't 
all going to lump together on the same square again.  
Isn't it a bit cramped sitting on the same perch?  
Don't you need room to spread your wings?  
Oh, hang on, I keep forgetting you are flightless.

<p>
(PRESCOTT to ALICE):  Unfortunately, that was my only big card.  I
suspect you'll be drawing a big card for a breakaway this turn.

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  RESERVOIRS): I think you may have waited one turn too long
to make your move.

<p>
(ERIC to WHITE MAID):  We're allowed to <i>conspire </i>?  No wonder
I'm losing!  Just watch us now.

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  QUADS): Do you know Triangle Man?

<p>
(DANA to BOOB):  I have <i>not</i> done any conspiring against you in
``Tour de Farce.''  Mainly I conspired against Tom in that game (by
keeping him out of it<font face="symbol"></font
>)

<p>
(BOOB to DANA): Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Tom is REALLY tough, but I'm gonna lose in ``Tour de Farce'' anyway.
Part of it was too much gloating too early and then this last turn
I miscalculated, ending my chances even more surely.

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB):  Will it do them any good?

<p>
(BOOB to WHITE MAID): I doubt it, you da man..... whoops, well, I guess
you aren't.... but everyone says you are!

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  GM): These big numbered cards make the race go too fast.  :(

<p>
(BOOB to PETEY): So YOU say....

<p>
(GAME QUERY BY THE DESIGNER): Should not Alice have replenished 
with a 1 last time instead of a 3?
<i>((I don't THINK so, should she have??))</i>
Is anyone going to be noble (read: ``dumb") enough to cover Alice's break? 
<i>((I don't THINK so, should anyone have??))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/
currently is on hiatus.
I'll try to remember to let you know when it returns.

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): (pre-apologies for this month's crude and
rude quote.... but these ARE the Mekons!) ``The foul breath of the lower
mouth becomes a jewel; Jewels can't be cut except with special tools.''
From ``Ostracism's Song to Pussycat'' which you can just TELL must
be off of the Mekons' collaboration with Kathy Acker, <i>Pussy, King of 
the Pirates</i>.
They've got EVERYTHING on the Vagina Monologues and more....
and speaking of births....

<p>
(BRITAIN-UKRAINE):  Damn...Dave, those little u's are having 
babies.

<p>
(UKRAINE): Ukrainian officials announced today 
that they would be sending an engineering
team to the Aegean sea to study traffic problems there.  According to
a spokesman a number of options have been considered to prevent traffic
jams like those seen the previous winter.  Some officials are said
to be favoring a traffic light, perhaps timed with those in the Ionian
and Istanbul, while other, more progressive members have been talking
about installing a traffic island.

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): I'm not expecting to make Ven, so I shouldn't be sitting there 
this spring. I should be back in Rom where he had nothing really to do and I 
don't expect too much this year.

<p>
(KIRK RESPONDING TO SPOCK AFTER WAKING UP FROM DRINKING A FIFTH OF ROMULAN ALE):
``We attacked who?...''

<p>
(BOOB to SPAIN): Care to retract that ``don't expect too much this year'' comment?

<p>
(SPAIN-BOARD): My e-mail address is on the szine. Since my home internet 
access is attached to LCCC and to get on the internet is through my mom's 
user name and password. Sometimes when I write someone it sometimes has my 
moms e-mail address as the person who sent the mail.
<i>((So, does that mean that both of the addresses above are good or not?
I think you are telling us to use the hotmail account....))</i>
