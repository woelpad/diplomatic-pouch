I didn't hear any live music all spring and summer.  So when I finally 
heard a concert October 13, my first national act of the year, I did it 
right:  a Rock'n'Roll Hall of Famer, from the second row.
     
Gregg Allman and Friends opened a new tour at Magic City Music Hall in 
Johnson City, New York, where I heard the Ratdog and Rusted Root shows I 
mentioned in my best-of-2005 article.  This was a fine show, all new 
arrangements by Gregg, played tightly considering it was the tour's 
first gig.  Danielia Cotton from New York City opened the show just as 
my cousin and I were up front checking out the big band's equipment, so 
we spent the night up front near stage right, close enough to watch 
musicians play and to see their expressions.  Something like 1500 people 
there but we were never crowded from behind into the rail.  Ms. Cotton ( 
http://www.danielia.com/site.php ) is the daughter of a jazz singer who 
writes her own rock and soul and blues.  Sometimes she plays with a full 
rock band, but for this show it was just her and one guy on guitars; 
hers was acoustic.  She has one album out, and is working on another.  I 
liked some of the new material, especially "Bang My Drum".  Good songs, 
done with heart.  Recommended.

After Danielia's one set and a short break, Allman came on with six 
other fine musicians.  This tour isn't the Allman Brothers Band with 
Dickie Betts, but guys with about a thousand years a cumulative 
experience with all sorts of rock and blues bands including past Gregg 
Allman "solo" tours:  Mike C. Barnes (guitar), Jay Collins (sax), Jerry 
Jemmott (bass), Neil Larson (keyboard), Floyd Miles (percussion) and 
Steve Potts (drums).  Boy oh boy, could they play.  Barnes would lay out 
the sweetest lines of electric slide guitar, subtle and moving, then rip 
the hottest wails without moving a facial muscle.  "Laconic" is the 
word.  Collins had two saxes, and I swear the bigger one was longer than 
an oboe.  It honked like an elephant lightly farting through its trunk, 
but it was just the ticket in the context where it was used.

Allman did a ton of new arrangements for this tour, and it was obvious.  
This wasn't like hearing a tribute band, or a band running through the 
same version they've been playing for years.  A couple of Allman songs 
were recast to a funk sound, and it worked.  Plenty more tunes were much 
bluesier than the recordings you hear on the radio.  They worked well, 
too.  A couple of vocal mikes gave Gregg bad squeals several times, but 
otherwise, the night went great.  The worst "problem" I had was the new 
arrangements; my neural network kept wanting to dance or lip-sync to the 
rhythms I was used to instead of the ones they were actually playing.  
But I consider "not the same ol'" to be an asset rather than a 
detraction.  They're doing this on the east coast for a couple of weeks 
in October, then taking a break, then touring from November through 
January.  If you get a chance, check it out.  Not just rehashing 
memories, this is creative new work done around the old framework, and 
it's fine to the ear.

I had a great time playing all sorts of boardgames and cardgames at PLAY 
2006 recently (14-17 September).  This was in Syracuse, NY so I hope we 
can recruit your brother next year.  It's invitational-only but Dave 
would be a good fit with these people.  The Syracuse local gamers have a 
friendly and sportsmanlike group that meets weekly.  I might go up 
occasionally for those Tuesday evenings.  The other out-of-towners were 
good folks too.  I knew Alan Moon from his early-1980s Avalon Hill work 
helping Diplomacy players and GMs, and later from a couple of the 
Linseys' housecons.  I've known Donna Balkan from housecons and WBC/WDC 
forever (though spouse Jim couldn't make it).  People came from Texas, 
Ohio, and Massachusetts as well as a few parts of NYS.  Three dozen or 
so, some of whom were only there for a day or two of the four-day gig.

Here's my list.  Played 23 games with three repeats = 20 different 
titles.  Learned 13 games.  Taught one game twice and taught another 
game once.  Won less than my share but came in second out of 4-5 players 
more than my share.  I learned those with an asterisk.

* PROPHECY [Altar], (did a crossword puzzle not counted in game stats), 
* VIKTORY II [Morrison Games], Ta Yu, Ra, Alhambra, * THE PATRONS OF 
VENICE [Toccata Games], * MASONS [Hans im Gluck/Rio Grande], Basari, * 
BUS [Splotter], * ALPHA TO OMEGA (group party game at the icebreaker), 
Fabrik der Traume, * EMIRA [Phalanx/Mayfair], * BURN IN HELL [Steve 
Jackson Games], * ZIG-ZAG [Kosmos/Rio Grande], Zig-Zag again, * 
CARROUSEL [Asmodee], Tadsch Mahal, * IN10SITY [Simply Fun], Louis XIV, 
Ta Yu (taught 2-player first time, taught others 3-player this time), * 
HELL RAIL [Mayfair], Scrabble, * LASS DIE KIRCHE INS DORF [Mucke 
Autorenrechte].

I donated an over twenty-year-old copy of BRITANNIA (I was disappointed 
to check the copyright date and find it wasn't quite an antique) to the 
prize table, and from the prize table I got a Mystery Bag, DRAGON DELTA, 
and the New York Times' CROSSWORD.  The Mystery Bag was a 
Kokopelli-themed drawstring-goodies-pouch, holding a CARCASSONNE 
expansion (The Count of C...), a 65-card deck (regular plus a fifth 
suit), and I think there was a simple set-collecting card game.

Lots of new friends, good times, new games, old favorites, no tournament 
stress, cruddy hotel located convenient to 90 and 81.  I'm very glad I 
went.  Next year it'll be the weekend before or after Memorial weekend, 
elsewhere in Syracuse.  I intend to schedule vacation days for it again.
