<p><br><p><br>My szine life has been a fiasco in the last few weeks.
The non-players got the last issue EXTREMELY late.
Causes?
Virtually every piece of computer hardware I touched for a week broke.
And this was on FOUR, count 'em FOUR, different systems.
The only system which had no problems at all was this old 386 machine
I'm typing on right this instant, which also has the entire backup
record of every issue of this szine.
Miraculously, I had everything I needed when I needed it backed up
so I lost nothing, except loads of time.
Thus, this issue is late a week, belying the Williams claim that
I am some kind of turbophreak.
The deadlines have been moved back a week and will put the
199 deadline a bit close to Christmas.
Watch out for that one.

<p>
Check out TWO issues of <i>Octopus' Garden</i> in the centerfold of the
szine.
I forgot to include #17 in the last issue - mega-apologies to Peter
Sullivan - but now we're caught up.
Note that Pete is the person to ask if you're interested in choo-choo
games.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada. 
You can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
The current game opening for Colonial Diplomacy will start
as soon as I get money from seven players since Nekayah has now ended.
For more on this, see below.
Also note that more results for the demo game 
are included.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
Note that everything has been moved to the diplom.org site.
See David's letter below.
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the devel.diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to the present are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the 
pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP directory in compressed postscript format.
The gracious assistance of Kevin Roust is most appreciated
in keeping up this site.
The files begin ap131.ps.Z and go sequentially from there.
Since it's UNIX based, all of those upper and lower cases are important.
If anyone wants help from me on doing this, they only have to ask and I
can help you determine if you have access to FTP which stands for
File Transfer Protocol and can handle postscript files.
The Caltech site is at:

<p>
ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/WWW/

<p>
or check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch 
at its brand new address with all of
the information you would need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
 
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch

<p>
In addition, through Jamie McQuinn's portion of the Pouch, or directly
through:

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP/

<p>
you can access the mirror site to Caltech and get to the szine that way.

<p>
In a relatively NEW development, the szine also is available as a PDF file,
readable with Adobe Acrobat's free reader.
If you already have Adobe's reader on your computer, you can E-Mail me for
a copy.
I am still in test mode with this.... you pretty much have to print
the szine to look at it as it just won't clear up on the screen.
Any of you who have NOT E-Mailed me about this test can still do so.
After I test this for a bit, I will have TWO E-Mail subscription lists
so you can choose PDF file, TeX source file, or both at your leisure.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR SCOTT HANSON</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>In a late flash, Keith Sherwood wins this contest and officially
``finds'' Scott Hanson.
Of course, I practically had to badger him into doing it.
For Internet searchers, this literally was the easiest search
we've had.
Scott has his own home page that any Internet search engine will
find for you.
More on this in Scott's letters below.
I will announce another ``mark'' in Issue #200.
I'm always taking suggestions.
While we're waiting, find some of these guys below!
I really want someone to track down Kevin Tighe, for whom we
started this contest in the first place.
C'mon, it can't be that hard.
You only have to bother the other 20 Kevin Tighe's for a few minutes
until you find the right one.
Do it nicely and they won't mind.
If you don't want to mention Diplomacy, just mention old pals like
Mark Luedi who I'm sure the right Kevin would never forget.
Remember, all those old farts like Mark still get the szine.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Mike Mills or Garret Schenck
or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.
For Scott Hanson you need to get him to write me a MUSIC letter.      
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
Dear Mr. Hanson (do you still go by Little Scottie as Kathy Byrne Caruso
used to call you?)

<p>
<p><b>Scott Hanson (Wed, 05 Nov 1997 20:23:23)</b>

<p>
Hey - that's -<i>MR.</i>- Little Scottie to you! 
(Actually, Kathy's name for me (at least the one she used publically) 
was Phydoux.) 
<i>((Kathy will be happy to know you are found, by the way.
Your bonus for being found is a complementary lifetime subscription
to my Diplomacy szine (even being in a foreign land).  The person
who found you gets</i> $<i>50 to be spent on hobby related activities
(e.g. szine subs, game starts, trips to cons, etc.).  You also
are not officially "found" until you write me a letter for print.
Are you saying who found you?  You can negotiate with that person
for anything you want.... this is mega-Diplomacy after all.))</i>

<p>
Since I manage two Internet domains, finding me shouldn't have been  
particularly difficult. Simply type `whois Scott Hanson' at your 
favorite (connected) Unix prompt. 
Or do a search for ``Scott and Frauke" at Yahoo. 
Or just point your web browser at http://maus.shcon.com. 
I'm not sure if I should let this person have any credit or not. 
After all, $50 is nearly DM 100, even if I don't play Diplomacy 
anymore... I should really keep it for myself.

<p>
Well, the Bcc header in E-mail was designed for situations like this. We'll 
see what (s)he has to say.
BTW, Frauke just got home from work and thought this whole story was 
``total beschuert" (OK, we speak German at home now... that means totally 
crazy. 
But even she remembered the name Jim-Bob Burgess.

<p>
<i>((The hobby is small and quiet these days, although much more
Internet oriented.))</i>
That's good. The things I hated most about publishing a zine 
were printing and postage costs.

<p><br><p><br><b>Scott Hanson (Date: Sat, 08 Nov 1997 06:45:14)</b>

<p>
This is an official I've-been-found letter. I do solemnly swear that I, 
Scott Hanson, former member and publisher of the PBM Diplomacy hobby, 
was convinced to write this letter after being contacted by Keith Sherwood.
Keith used a very ingenious method to arouse my curiosity. 
He sent me a totally blank E-mail message. There wasn't even a name in the 
From: line, just the address <font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
>ksher of cts.com<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>. 
Since it was the weekend and my curiosity was aroused, 
I searched the Internet and found the E-mail address had the name 
`Kristi Sherwood' in San Diego. I sent a careful reply saying that I had 
received a blank message and that I used to know a K. Sherwood in 
San Diego. 
Only then did Keith send me an intelligible message. 

<p>
A short history of the past 10 years: after a short hiatus in Phoenix 
(our last hobby contact was a visit with Eric and Cathy Ozog), 
Frauke and I came to Germany in 1990. 
She's with McDonald's Deutschland as operations manager for northern 
Germany and is based in Hamburg. I'm a typesetter/web janitor/Mac systems
plumber for a small science publisher. 
We're in our mid 30s, been married 14 years now, no kids, 
same 3 cats as we had in the States, and we built a house last year. 
<i>((Yeah, I saw that you did that on your Web page.))</i>
We have a picture of it at http://maus.shcon.com. 

<p>
Keith gave me an ftp address (ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu) for TAP, 
but the most recent issue there was 186. 
<i>((Partly for production problems and time lazyness on my end, I
decided not to update the ftp site until I heard from someone that it
actually was being accessed.
You have given me exactly the reason to have everything up.
I'll get caught up momentarily.))</i>
I was pleasantly surprised to see several names there I recognized. 
Are more recent issues available someplace else? 

<p>

<p><br><p><br><b>Scott Hanson (Sat, 08 Nov 1997 19:17:17)</b>

<p>
I was finally able to find a copy of the current <i>TAP</i> 
(on Peter Sullivan's web pages, then I had to compile the 
TeX source myself), and I see that I have to 
write a music letter in order to save the szine from folding. 
Fine. Here it is.
<i>((I've spared everyone the German - see the translation one
letter down....
it's good to know that Peter is keeping up the latest TeX source code.
I'm working on these formatting problems.))</i>

<p>
-OK, there's my music message. If you tell me, Jim-Bob, how you were able 
to find me (and why you bothered), I'll send the English translation. 
But if you don't, you still have to give Keith his reward, 
and you're not allowed to fold the szine with issue 200!

<p>

<center>Scott, shanson of shcon.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((You guys don't get to hear my answer (partly because I blew it 
away by accident.
The key to it was that I took over the music list tradition in the
hobby from Scott when he folded <b>Irksome</b> and he had a RESPONSIBILITY
to bring us up to date on what HE had been listening to.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Scott Hanson (Date: Sun, 09 Nov 1997 14:01:55)</b>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
Thanks for the answer. After having spent 2 weeks trying to figure out 
what was going on with the search, and several days trying to find a 
recent issue, I wasn't real happy to see that you knew where I was 
the entire time. If you wanted a letter from me, you could have 
just asked. Oh well.
<i>((I had already decided that you were going to be the subject of
the search regardless of how easy you were going to be to find.
After starting the search, I was worried when nothing happened (again)
right away and so one night I did a quick search and quite frankly
was shocked at how easy it was.
Then once I found you I didn't want to close down the contest.
I wanted someone who KNEW you to find you, who knew that using
Frauke's name in a search engine along with yours was bound to
get a unique hit.
Keith was that person.
So he wins and I feel very happy about it.))</i>

<p>
Why bother with postscript/pdf for the internet archives? You use such a
spartan format, it would seem that HTML would be the least complicated 
for everyone. 
I've been playing this morning with translating the TeX file I 
downloaded to HTML, and except for the tables the results are pretty good.
<i>((Care to let me know how to do it?
I got lost the first time I tried.
I was going to check out a web site that a Professor at Yale recommended
to me, but if you can give me a hint, I'd appreciate it.))</i>
(Easier than translating from Quark XPress to HTML, which I have to do
at work....) 

<p>
Gotta go... Scott

<p>
<p>Translation follows (omitting the first 2 paragraphs of ranting and 
raving, additional comments are in parentheses)
<i>((I also had a translation problem with a couple of the German
words.
TeX of course can make any of them, but they didn't translate through
E-Mail to my system properly.
I've made some guesses, which are probably close, but wrong.
Sorry about that.))</i>

<p>
The music business is dead these days, isn't it? I mean, the record 
companies don't have any big successes anymore, not compared to the '70s 
and '80s. (I have a theory as to why... the fragmentation of the radio 
market in the US has led to strict definitions of genres. New music that
doesn't fit into a genre doesn't get marketed, and the old genres become 
moribund.) Take big concerts, as an example. Is there a band that was 
founded after 1980 that can fill stadiums today? REM was founded in 
1980... I just checked.
(And who does fill the stadiums? Around here over the past few years, 
Michael Jackson, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Meat Loaf, Prince, Kiss, 
Tina Turner, U2, REM... all shades of Rip Van Winkle!) 

<p>
The music that interests me most these days is mostly in German 
(pop music here is about 80% English / 20% German). 
I'm sure that's because I'm living here now 
(and I think pop is a good mirror of society). 
`Die Krzte' and `Die Toten Hosen' 
(two old punk bands who still put albums in the Top 10) are 
among my favorites, but new German hip hop is also good... 
starting with `Die Fantaschtischen Vier', and newer bands like 
`Fettes Brot', `Cappucino', `Fruendeskreis', Sabrina Setlur. 
I am familiar with most of these only from the radio, 
but the last CD that I bought was the latest from 
`Tic Tac Toe'... OK, so they are a tenny band, but their single 
``Warum'' (``Why'', the true story of a school friend of one 
of the singers who slipped into drugs, prostitution, and finally suicide) 
is simply excellent. 
``Mr. Wichtig'' isn't bad either.
(I should also mention `Rammstein', a sort of techno meets Judas Priest.)

<p>
Frauke doesn't especially like German music, but her last CD came 
accidentally from Germany. 
`Cultured Pearls' come from Hannover, as far as I can tell, and 
have a single ``Sugar Sugar Honey"... super soul! 

<p>
- - -

<p>
Otherwise, I'm more interested in pop than serious music these days, 
at least in the pop that dares to experiment. 
Of course, 90% of everything is crap, but that leaves the 10% 
that isn't crap. Now pop is a craft (not an art), 
and some of the recent well-crafted singles that come to mind right 
now are ``Fantasy'' by Mariah Carey, ``Pray'' by DJ Bobo, 
``Ready or Not'' by The Fugees, ``Fire by Scooter, Wannabe'' 
by The Spice Girls (but everything else they've done is crap :). 
Looking at the latest charts, the only single that sounds interesting 
is ``Take It To The Limit'' by Mr. President.

<p>
The band Nena broke up shortly after their success in the mid 80's. 
The singer Nena was cheated by her managers, lost everything, 
but just this year did a comeback album and small tour. 
I haven't bothered to check it out (although someone this year 
did a techno remake of ``Nur Getrumt'').

<p>
Ska revival... what's that? 

<p>

<center>Scott, shanson of shcon.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Ah, so that hasn't made it over to Germany yet?
You remember the ska bands of the early 80's like the Specials,
don't you?
Well, there is a BIG revival that this szine started to talk about
two years ago and really hit the charts this year.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones have made it the biggest, but the 
smaller bands are still the best.
Brad Wilson is writing a ``ska revival'' story for his szine and
I don't want to trump him.
I'll send you a copy when I get it.
Now, let's hear from the winner....))</i>

Thanks for keeping me on the CC list.  Very interesting listening to all
this.  Scott, with his 7 letters in 4 days, is about the most animated
dead wood I've ever seen.  (Oops, sorry, Scott is (lost) old fart; I am
dead wood.  Have I sent you my ``Best Music of '95" List yet Jim?)
<i>((No, you haven't..... I'm STILL waiting!!
You had better weigh in this year.))</i>

<p>
Frauke Peterson &amp; Scott Hanson was definitely the key search on Yahoo. 
Their home page was a direct hit.  Remind me to sell my stock in Excite,
which was a definite miss.

<p>
The only CDs I have bought lately (and they are few and far between) are
Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, and Billie Holiday.  Obviously, I
have discovered classic female Jazz.  And the stuff I enjoy most on the
radio now is contemporary (and young) females: Alanis, Feona Apple,
Sheryl Crow, etc.  Independent, Gen X women rock!  And to admit just how
far into middle age I have degenerated, I will even admit to liking VH1
Popup video (although the theme song makes me long for the Buggles).
<i>((My car tape with ``Video Killed the Radio Star'' is still my 
absolute favorite.
There is NO better way to start a morning than by roaring out of your
driveway singing along to that song.))</i>

<p>
Yeah, Scott, keep telling him: TeX is dead, HTML is The Way.  Of course,
Unix is terminally ill, and NT is cutting the life support.  Latest
(professional) book purchase: UNIX System 5 Network Programming. Rago,
93.  That a 4 year old book still has relevance for an operating system
is damning praise indeed.

The call goes out for special Issue #200 letters on music!
From this point on, I reserve the right to hold letters or portions of
letters for that issue.
It will appear toward the end of January after a six week or so hiatus.
I intend to have this set of submissions have two parts (submit your
thoughts on one or both, but NOT neither!): 

<p>
a) Your thoughts on what music of 1997 meant to you - possibly in
the form of top (whatever number) CDs, favorite/memorable concerts,
zapper singles that made you jump out of your chair, or whatever
form you like! - which can be a list, or it can have lots of 
discussion/comments.
For me this has been the most fascinating music year in some time,
what about for you?
Can't you at least give me ONE song that stood out to you?
Sure you can.

<p>
b) Your thoughts on how music has changed/progressed/declined over
the approximately 13 year history of this szine's focus on music
issues (choose a relevant time window of your own if you like -
that's the primary range I'll be looking at).
This could be a new or revaluation of a list of your top CD/records
of the decade/century or it could take a discussion format.
The main point is that it be YOUR story.
Your story does count (much as I realize that many of you don't
seem to think I believe that).
Originally, I was going to do a list (and I still may) but 
I am now leaning to something more verbal.

<p>
You can also combine the two questions to say something very short and simple.
I even want to hear from those of you who would
say something like this (for example): ``I grew up in the 70's listening
to Yes, Genesis, and Renaissance and you know what?
That's all I still like to listen to.
Well, except, Anthony Phillips has another great album out this year.''
Then I can ask: ``Great! Where can I find it??''
Give it a ride!

<p><br><p><br><b>Jamie McQuinn (Mon, 10 Nov 1997 11:05:31 GMT-5)</b>

<p>
The recent discussion of Uncle Bonsai in <i>TAP</i> reminds me of the story 
about how I didn't get to see UB in concert.

<p>
My wife was pregnant with our first child, and not due for another 
three weeks.  We had tickets for the Uncle Bonsai concert in Ann 
Arbor, and met some friends for dinner before the show.  Some were 
going, some weren't.

<p>
Of course, you guessed it, she went into labor during the meal, and 
we had to head off to the hospital.  Fortunately, we were able to 
give our tickets to our friends, who said it was a great concert.

<p>
Shortly thereafter the band broke up.  So whenever I retell that 
story to my now 8-year-old daughter, I remind her that she owes me.  
I figure that when she is a teenager, and she wants to go see the hot 
new group, The Flaming Twisted Freaks (or whatever is big in 2005), I 
get to say ``no" just because she made me miss Uncle Bonsai.

<p>
You noted that Ratshin, the male member of the group remains active.  
I have one of his CDs, <i>I Am Joe's Eyes</i>.  It is him alone, but he 
called himself the Electric Bonsai Band.  If you enjoy Uncle Bonsai, 
you will probably like this recording as well.

Diplomacy ten player variant.
There are about 50 supply centers and it is set across a map 
slightly more expansive than the original's European map.
This game is very popular on the Judges and has just been written
about by Chris Warren in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83.
If I get one more person interested, I'll print the rules and officially
announce a game opening.
Currently, Eric Ozog, Brad Wilson, 
and Harry Andruschak have expressed interest.
If not, I'll wait until another regular game or two ends before
starting another regular Diplomacy game.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny,
John Schultz, and Harry Andruschak are signed up.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
I'm also STRONGLY thinking of opening a game of Breaking Away.
Is there any interest??
If so, we'll start listing that one.
You don't need to own the game to play, I'm going to use 
Keith Thomasson's house rules that include the ``how to play the game.''
I thank John Harrington, the game's inventor, for provisionally 
allowing approval for this.

<p>
Otherwise Conrad is now the new editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I've REALLY corrected some phone numbers and E-Mail 
addresses and such above.

<p>
2) Thank you to Lee Kendter, Jr., for the Miller Number on the game!
He is now gone ``electronic''!
``Now on line!  
Email address = lkend of erols.com''
Szine editors, please note!!

<p>
3) The map is in the szine here somewhere.
I apologize to Britain and Japan that there isn't really room to write in
their ``island'' units, so they come out as just a smudge.
I think, in general, everyone will prefer to have the map with the
province names on it, rather than the blank one I was going to use.
Anyway, we'll go with this for a while and see where it ends up.
And wow, how weird to adjudicate with a map.
I usually adjudicate the regular games in my head, occasionally glancing
at the maps in the szine.
Here, I had to look at every move on the map.
It was a bit slower than I'm used to.
Well, that's why I like GMing - it sharpens my tactics.
I'll be a better Colonial player when I'm done.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURK to WORLD): Let the lack of e-, snail or any other sort of mail begin.

<p>
(HOLLAND - WORLD): Dutch East Indian Trading Company is open for
business.   Emissaries from England and France have been entertained.
Others are invited.  

<p>
(TURK to MOMMY RUSSIA DEAREST): Every letter I have received from the rest
of the board declares the sender's intent to hand you your bowels tastefully
displayed &#224; la Martha Stewart.  (``A little parsley from your own garden
offsets the blues and greens of the brutalized kidney and spleen...")

<p>
(MULDER to SCULLY): It's a conspiracy I tell you. I have evidence that the
aliens are making the Chinese go after the Russians, the French go after the
Germans and the British go after the Chinese. who will be influenced next?

<p>
(CHINA-ALL): In honour of another game played in this szine, 
I thought it would
be a good and noble thing if we started every turn of this game with a quote.
Instead of Friedrich Nietzsche, the person whose quotes seem more appropriate
for this game is Tim Rice. I was going to pick Cuba Gooding Jr. quotes, but
since the only thing I've ever seen him in is <i>Lightning Jack</i> it seemed
pointless. 

<p>
(TIM RICE QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``How straightforward the game, when one has
respect for one's players..." - ``Endgame" from the musical <i>Chess</i>

<p>
(TURK to MICHENER): Okay, I loved the book, now the  trouble is to GET my
fleet to Hawaii AND set up a convoy line.

<p>
(BOOB to CHINA): You'll get NO arguments from me should you continue
these quotes.
I love <i>Chess</i>.
You'll have to jump over France into Bangkok - at least for one night!!

<p>
(TURKEY to CHINA):  Go ahead, make my day.  STEP over Britain and get in my
face!

<p>
(CHINA-RUSSIA): See, I do have respect for you, even if you think I am the
great Satan. Therefore I have not attacked you. 

<p>
(TURK to THE EAST SIDE OF THE BOARD): Hello? (tap, tap, tap)  HellOOOooo?

<p>
(CHINA-TURKEY): You said you haven't heard much from this end of the map. 
In response to your plight I say, ``HI TERRY!!!!!!!!"

<p>
(CHINA-JAPAN): Do you have a problem with me building fleets? 

<p>
(CHINA-FRANCE): Do you have a problem with me moving south?

<p>
(CHINA-BRITAIN): Do you have a problem with me moving west?

<p>
(CHINA-HOLLAND): Do you have a problem with me moving anywhere?

<p>
(CHINA-BOOB): Do you have a problem with the Patriots moving to Providence?
<i>((I thought I explained all that.
The answer is yes - at least if they are going to wipe out the south
side of my neighborhood and be a giant barrier between us and 
the new mall and downcity (as we call downtown around these here parts).
Currently, the Providence deal is dead and they are trying to renovate
the stadium in Foxboro; however, that legislation is faring badly and
getting caught up in the death penalty debates in the Massachusetts
legislature.
My guess?
The Patriots will be back looking at Providence or gone to somewhere West
pretty soon.
We gotta find a new site though if it's gonna be here (not that I care).))</i>

<p>
(THE TURKISH CASTLE): The barbarian turned from the vista of the bone-white
city, surrounded by the rocky plain.  The duck was paddling around the koi
pool, half heartedly trying to score lunch.
	
``You know," muttered the duck around a goldfish that had already
been a floater, ``This is a whole new world!  Some of these people may have
never been stabbed by me!  Fresh backs!"
	
``True," muttered the barbarian.  ``But that doesn't resolve the
question of what happened to Red Daf.  And what of the french frog and the
Turkish french poodle and the German/Anglo tweedle dee und dumber
combination?"
	
A voice from the door way intoned, ``You are NOT in the Szine
Register game anymore, Totoad Father."
	
The barbarian turned and saw a figure, vaguely male (some five
o'clock shadow) wrapped in silk embroidered with dragons, herons,
butterflies, holstein cattle, gophers, unicorns, draft horses, Geo
hatchbacks, congressmen and women who receive money from the NRA, and a
bull hamster rampant.  ``You are the Chinese representative, I presume."

<p>
(BOOB'S WARNING): Watch out for those bull hamsters.
They're the most dangerous.

<p>
<i>Game Notes (firmly orbiting in the tropopause):</i>

<p>
1) We're here, the final round of nukes!
Don't waste your last shot as the game remains very tight.
Almost anyone - anyone except Randy - can still win.

<p>
2) For the rest of the game, if Jeff doesn't submit orders, his units
will hold and his nukes will go unfired.
Note that contact with Jeff likely will improve if you use his new
address.
Naturally, Randy has another new address too.
Use it in good health.

<p>
3) I had some fun linking the press this time around.
Check out ALL the puns carefully.
You guys are SOOOO helpful in indulging the GM's delights.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DR.&nbsp;PALINDROME-ENGLAND): Sex at noon taxes.

<p>
(ELLIS to ANDRUSCHAK): Hope your travel south is going well.
<i>((Not exactly.... see below.))</i>
By the way, I've calmed down now.
You will not receive any nukes from me in the final round.
Your nuking me was per your publicly announced agenda.
In any case.... at last we are at the grand finale.
<i>((We're all set up to have the final moves in Issue #200.))</i>

<p>
(DR.&nbsp;PALINDROME-FRANCE): Degas, are we not drawn outward, we
freer few, drawn onward to new eras aged?

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): <i>TAP</i>-195 arrived 21 October.
There has been a major change in my vacation plans but this will
not affect my participation in <i>TAP</i>.
Last Wednesday Marine Expeditions Inc. phoned me that they were
unilaterally cancelling the Antarctica trip.
The stated reason was the ship would not be ready in time.
I was offered some alternative trips but none fit my schedule.
No other offers, explanations, or apologies were offered.

<p>
If I were living in Toronto, where Marine Expeditions is based,
I would be very tempted to give them a demonstration of a disgruntled
postal worker ``going postal''.
Especially after being told it would take several weeks to refund
my money.
I am very pissed off at Marine Expeditions.

<p>
I looked into substitute vacations, but with only 2-3 weeks to book,
well, most overseas vacations are fully booked, others would require
hard to get visas, others would cost a fortune in last minute hotel
and air reservations, and what was available was not what I was 
really interested in.

<p>
So I decided to just take another automobile vacation to Seattle and back.
Why Seattle?
Mother, Sister, Niece, and much other family there.
I will be driving around 28 October-14 November and will write up a trip
report for FOSFAX as usual.
(Speaking of which, have they sent you a copy of <i>FOSFAX</i> yet, as I 
requested them to?)
<i>((Yes, was I supposed to send samples back??
No note or explanation was included although I gathered you were the
proximate cause.))</i>
I'll avoid the Interstates and take as many scenic byways as might be
open this time of year, considering that snowfall has occured in
many places.

<p>
Anyhow, I also await the start of the Black Hole game and the Modern 
Diplomacy game, plus whatever ``hopeless'' standby positions become
available.
<i>((I note with amusement that people like you, Harry, sign up and

(POOFREADER to LUKE): So did you notice in issue 190 that there
is no amino acid called ``acerbic acid''?
A clue was the alleged enzyme ``tauroboliase'', whose roots 
(preceding the ``-ase'' suffix used for enzymes) mean ``bull shit''.

(POOFREADER to EDITOR): Also in issue 190, in the <i>ZR</i> 
Patheticational Game,
<i>((Hey, look, they're all writing press - by mandate - what

you misspelled my correction of a previous writer's
``acclImation'' to ``acclAmation'' (from the verb ``acclaim'').
I may have to nuke you again for being <b>WRONG</b>...

<p>
(DR.&nbsp;PALINDROME-ITALY): Wonders!
In Italy Latin is red now.

<p>
(MIKE to KEITH): On that ``most worthwhile/useful high school classes''
question: I wasn't actually a high school student during the best
candidate I can think of.
As an eighth-grader, the math 8th-grade honors course (basically
the 9th grade algebra curriculum) was too slow and boring for me
and one other guy, so they switched us to 9th-grade honors math
(geometry) at the high school.
After walking down from the junior high each day, I would teach myself
the version of BASIC that ran on the Digital PDP-8.
That turned my general facility with logical systems toward skill
at writing and using software; and that has helped me get most
non-slave-level jobs I've had.
<i>((Wow, spooky.
I had a strikingly similar experience that I was thinking about 
recently because I just wrote about it somewhere.
I think it was in a private letter to Terry, rather than in the szine.
[if Terry sends it back to me, I'll print it, so you can see how I
structured my description so similarly]
The main difference was that: the high school was too far away so 
I did the BASIC teaching to myself instead of taking any math class at all.
I showed my understanding of probability and risk taking ending the
year by convincing the teacher to trade in the A she was going to give
me for a draw from a card deck (Diamond for an ``Honors'' grade, Heart 
for an A, Club for a B, and Spade for a C).  
I pulled the Ace of Diamonds and got the Honors grade.
My four quarterly grades for the year were C,B,A,Honors (I was so bored at the
beginning that I wasn't doing the work and got the A in the third quarter
as part of an earlier deal to bag the last quarter of the class for the
independent study computer idea.))</i>

<i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FA note draw has been rejected.
In its place a concession to the Great Satan... ummm, I mean Russia,
has been proposed.
A concession to France also has been proposed.
Please vote on both proposals with your Winter orders.

<p>
2) Note Randy's new address.
I expect we'll get a phone number presently.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE PEOPLE to VON STEUBEN): Don't give up!
We need you!
Fight on!
Fight on!
Don't let us lose our country!

<p>
(LANGWORTHY to BOARD): This has turned into a rather interesting 
game (at least for me).  I spent a long time thinking about what 
to do.  There were so many options.

<p>
(BARNO to SKYWALKER): Kent has the same problem you mentioned: too many
options.
(``Too many, with only one unit?'' you ask.)
Kent is, um, easily confused.

<p>
(THE LIVERPOOL UNDERGROUND): Reports have been coming in that the
famed Mike Barno has escaped!
Emaciated, exhausted, almost expired.
Extremely exampled.
Yet alive!
Free!
Rumors pour in that even now he is making for the Swiss Embassy.
The renowned hunter and tracker Elmer Fudd is once again hot
on his trail with bloodhounds in fast pursuit.
A reward has been issued Dead or Alive!
We will keep all concerned updated on this event as news of his
journey transpires...

<p>
(AUSTRIA-HUNGARY to WORLD): Sorry for the lack of communication guys.
I was in Yellowstone, Modesto CA, Flagstaff AZ, Overland Park KS, and
Houston TX, before I arrive in Florida Nov. 15th.
I don't expect any more COA's until May... 
    
(GERMANY): This has turned into a rather tenuous game.  I spend a 
long time worrying about what to do.  Then I realized there was 
little I could do.
     
(ELLIS-BOARD): This has turned into a rather good game.  I was bored 
when Russia and I were rolling across the board.  Defending my 
homeland from invading hordes gives my so many more options to 
think about.
     
(RUSSIA-BOARD): This game sucks.  I was going to win and then I blew it.
   
(THE DISGRUNTLED WELSHMAN to THE WORLD): I wish I could kick a few arses
meself!
Maybe the Russians have some butt kickin' to do yet!
Will see lads, will see!
 
(KEITH to RANDY): The French are bad tippers? What about students 
(e.g. NAU)?
   
(MIKE to RANDY): Did you survive the 60-mile hike?
You didn't fetch Stuart and Russell here afterward so I wonder if
the bears ate you all.
No, you'd trip Russell and get away while his brains were being
evaluated by the taste-test method.
<i>((Would they even have to trip him?
You hear the old joke all the time, I'm sure, you don't
have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the slowest runner.))</i> 

<p>
(GM to BOARD): This has turned into quite an interesting game. 
Yes, yes, yes.... actually it's a fascinating position.

<p>
(BOOB to BORED BOARD): Yes, I actually said that, or something like it.
Let's finish with some thrilling journals...

<p>
(JOURNALS OF AN ENGLISHMAN): It wa a quiet, lovely evening.
The leaves were scattering in the wind as I stroll through the park.
The lamp lights had been lit and I pondered what the outcome of the war
would bring to this country.
After all, Austria still retained her integrity, but the Russians
were ruthless and not too far away.
I was deep in thought when I heard a faint sound.
I stopped and listened.
There it was again.
A kind of dull thump.
I left the walkway and headed towards a large tree.
As I came around it I could see a man beating someone else with a cane.
I immediately seized his arm and swung him around.
To my amazement, I recognized him.
It was none other than the infamous Baron von Steuben!
He was frothing at the mouth and looking quite mad.
He kept screaming, ``Get Dead!  Get Dead!''
It was more than I could take.
I shook him violently and bellowed, ``Good God, man!
Snap out of it!''
His eyes blinked and then he began to breathe easier.
I then turned my attention to the figure lying on the ground.
I knelt down and noticed an odd thing.
What was before me was no man.
It was a stuffed dummy dressed up to look like a man!
I rose and confronted the Baron.

<p>
``Sir.
Are you better?''

<p>
He responded, ``Thank you.
I'm sorry you had to witness that.
It is a sort of sport that I conduct every evening.
It helps to relieve stress.''

<p>
``But, beating on a stuffed dummy?
It seems so barbaric.''

<p>
The Baron smiled, ``It's not just any old set of rags.
It has a certain representation for me.''

<p>
``What may I ask is that?''

<p>
``It is made to resemble Ambassador Sherwood,'' he replied.

<p>
I thought about that for a moment.
An evil smile creased my lips.
I stepped over and began to vigorously kick this stuffed
set of debris with all my might!
The Baron joined me and together in unison we giggled insanely
and put our passions away in a delightful stress relieving endeavor...
After all, when in Rome...

1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Dick Martin, and Vince Lutterbie
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is presently
missing, so I am running low on standbys here...).
Someone find Mike Mills!!
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!
Although press in this szine is generally black, I will make the
exception here that I will say who has NPRed and is ``at risk''
for being dropped. 
I screwed up my accounting for this last time.
So this turn I start over.
This season, we got press only from France, England, and Italy.
Thus everyone else is on the bubble for Fall. 
Wait, here's something from Turkey too.
Scratch that.
ONLY Germany and Russia are on the bubble for Fall.

in/near Boston and has recently moved to NYC. The song was released in
the past five years. She is nationally known. The lyrics are:
``I'm a goddess in your eyes and I will never die
I was born of peoples needs and what they want to believe
But I'm a liar, that's the truth, Go home and think it through
That's the harm in history, All you know is what you see.''

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Selected Broadcast Press (Endgame):</i>

<p>
(ENDGAME STATEMENT from uejon of TTACS.TTU.EDU as FRANCE):
Well, quite a game.  It's hard to know where to begin the EOG statement.
For starters, I'm happy to have survived.  Even after weathering the first
storm, I had limited confidence that I would make it to the end.  I was
once a 10-unit Italy, largest power on the board, and embarking on my assault
on England when my erstwhile Austrian ally stabbed me.  In a few short
years, I was history.   So reaching a fairly large size is no guarantee of
participation in a draw.

<p>
The early part of the game was most interesting.  I was lied to on all
fronts.  England took the Channel, and Germany attacked from the east,
while Italy moved into Piedmont.  I had resigned myself to an early exit,
but I did not give up.  I stayed in contact with my neighbors, and
benefited when Italy turned east.  The most important development was
Pitt's willingness to reverse field and allow me to repulse the English
attack.  Before long, England was near elimination.  Austria (Edi) was a
main player in bringing this about.   As important, Pitt and I talked over
the phone and developed an effective plan for mutual expansion.  The
benefits of the plan were clear enough.

<p>
The F-I relationship was particularly interesting.  My policy throughout
the game was to befriend and support Italy.  Unfortunately, Italy did not
see things quite the way I did.  I told him the truth about why I wanted
his friendship: to buffer against Turkey.  I anticipated a draw, and I
tried to impress on Italy that he would most likely participate in it if he
and I worked together.  Cal, however, thought that he could manage the F-T
conflict to his own benefit by allying with Turkey.  His reasoning (at
least as expressed to me) was that he could occupy the stalemate line, thus
being in position to throw the game if either F or T stabbed.  My response
was to point out that I had virtually no presence in the Med, while Turkey
was, of necessity, a massive presence.  I don't think I ever had more than
three fleets in the Med, and when Italy threw in with Turkey I had only
one.  I don't think Cal read this situation correctly.  But no matter what
I did, Cal would not go against Turkey, and this led to his demise.

<p>
For some reason, Cal thought I had a chance at a win, while Turkey did not.
Cal was proven right on Turkey's chances  by events, but it was a close
call.  I still don't see why he thought France could win outright.  I
always expected a draw, and indeed I thought the game would end with as
many as five remaining powers.

<p>
At one point, England was down to one center and I could have easily
eliminated him, but I chose not to do so.  Quite honestly, I don't recall
all the tactical considerations at that moment.  I do recall (without
reviewing old messages) that I was about to attack Germany and I needed the
English fleet for some reason.  More, I was then large enough to want to
gather small powers to my side.  I befriended Russia and England, then
launched the attack on Germany.  Why did I attack Germany?  Simply, I felt
I had no other decent opportunities, and Germany was somewhat vulnerable.
I hoped to rebuild both Russia and England as solid allies.  I calculated
that I would always be the dominant partner, and rescuing my former enemy
(England) from oblivion would be the basis for long-term trust.  This did
happen; although I think England had a couple of opportunities (before
Turkey got so big) to stab me and make for an even more chaotic game, we
maintained open and honest communication for the rest of the game.

<p>
In the most controversial move in the game, Russia sacrificed himself to
ensure my capture of Munich (not necessary, as it turned out), but I did
participate in building England back up, ultimately to participate in the
draw.   In part, I did this because this was a demo game, and I thought it
would be neat to show observers that no situation is hopeless.  Also, Jamie
is an excellent tactician, and I wanted his advice.

<p>
My most unfortunate relationship was with Germany.  Germany saved me from
oblivion, yet I later turned on him.  Then, when he was down to a unit or
two, England and I took him out to reduce the size of the draw, after using
him to set up the stalemate against Turkey.  Not very nice on my part.
Nothing personal, Pitt, just sheer opportunism.

<p>
Hohn and I did not communicate at all at the beginning, and then not much
for the remainder of the game.  We bandied about the idea of a 2-way, but I
never took it that seriously.  I have participated in one 2-way draw).  It
was founded on game-long trust and cooperation, so strong that at the end
neither of us could imagine stabbing the other for a win.  Hohn and I never
developed that kind of relationship, so I did not trust him to carry
through a 2-way draw promise, and, quite honestly, he had no reason to
think that I would.  As things turned out, I would have had to bear much
the larger burden of risk anyway, so I opted for the 3-way.

<p>
I'm not quite sure what was going on for Russia.  I know he became highly
offended by what he saw as maltreatment by Austria and Turkey.  Perhaps he
had good reason for that.  In any event, he became my vassal.  I wish we
had played it so he had not been eliminated (at least not when he was) but
them's the breaks.

<p>
Austria and I spoke a lot.  Edi called regularly until his fate was more or
less sealed.  Also, I think he gave up on me when I did not come through on
his expectations.  I misled him into thinking I would do things I did not
do.  I wanted him to think I would, but I never fully committed, even
though Edi no doubt thinks I did.  I tried to support him toward the end,
but by then it was too late.

<p>
I have always played Diplomacy by computer.  I started out in the
Compuserve and Genie Dip areas, then moved to the judges after I dropped
the pay services.  I found it downright startling to receive a phone call
from someone (usually Edi) on diplomacy.  I'm used to having a chance to
think about my response before making it, and also to manipulating the
timing of my responses.  I find it much easier to frame things just the way
I want in email rather than in a person-to-person conversation.  I'm not
surprised that the FTF players among us had some difficulty with this
format.  I know I felt it in reverse.  The game was good experience for me
in giving me a taste of the FTF world, though far short of the real thing.

<p>
The middle game is my weak point, and it showed up here.  I did not display
good tactics when I had a large force to manage.  This cost me dearly in my
battle with TI.  I went from an offensive position to a precarious
defensive position in one turn.  I need to spend more time on tactics
during the middle game rather than going with my first or second cut.

<p>
I'd be interested in others' views on my decision to attack Germany.  Was
this a wise move, or should I have done something else?
More later, perhaps.

<p>
(TURKEY'S END-OF-GAME STATEMENT IN ``GHODSTOO"):
Right.  It's 2:00 a.m., I'm a bit buzzed from too much booze, and I
have a shitload of work to do tomorrow.  Yet the muse has struck, and
I find myself finally prepared to talk about this great game.

<p>
As a preliminary disclaimer, some may find my writing style to be
overly formalistic and/or blunt.  I'm not entirely sure why I tend to
do this, perhaps it's because I'm a lawyer.  In any case, these are my
honest and straightforward thoughts, and please, if you wish to take
issue with them, I welcome you to.  There is little I enjoy more than
strenuous and heated debate.

<p>
So, to begin.  I'm pretty goddamn happy with the way this game turned
out, all things considered.

<p>
First, I was happy to draw Turkey.  Turkey is my second favorite
nation, right behind France.  Sometimes I think I play Turkey the best
out of all of the countries, even though I enjoy France more.  Many of
my best performances have come with Turkey.  The thing I love most
about Turkey is that you can never, ever count Turkey out.  On so many
occasions, I've been down to 3, 2 and even 1 center with Turkey, yet
I've managed to climb out of my predicament and roll onward to a
respectable finish, sometimes even victory.  At San Diego DipCon in
1989, my solo victory (which happened to be the only solo victory in
the entire con) was with Turkey, after being reduced to 3 centers in
1902 and 1903.  A cagey defense can work wonders, and I can often
outlast my persecuters with Turkey.

<p>
So yes, I was thrilled to have drawn it.

<p>
Having Edi to my northwest in Austria was also a great relief.  Edi
and I have always worked well together.  He and I could tell you some
rather remarkable stories about DipCons past, and indeed, those games
have been some of my all-time favorites.

<p>
At this point, I'd like to raise potentially controversial issue
number one.  When you've worked well with someone in the past, and you
do so again, is that ``cross-gaming?"  Or is that just the benefits of
experience?  I tend toward the latter, although I know some who argue
the former.  In my mind, the distinction is that although I know from
experience that Edi is a great player who tends toward strong
alliance, that doesn't mean I automatically go with him.

<p>
Since this was a demo game, I decided to do the exact opposite, in
fact.  I wanted to torch Edi quickly, not only because I had never
started initially adverse to him and wanted to try a new experience,
but also because I knew he was dangerous.  No offense to the rest of
my esteemed colleagues, most of whom I didn't know before this game in
any event, but I considered Edi to be the most dangerous other player
on the board, and I accordingly wanted to axe him.

<p>
To that end, I attempted to cultivate a strong RT.  Mark seemed to be
on board with the idea, as well as personable and likeable, with an
apparently strong sense of the game.  We exchanged what must have been
dozens of kilobytes of text, hashing out specific details, and
ultimately I figured he was solid, and that he was going to go with
me.  Meanwhile, Edi and I had exchanged a perfunctory message or two,
along the lines of ``Hey, let's kick butt together, we've done it
before, we'll do it again."  And we didn't talk much more than that.

<p>
Of course, as my S1901 moves indicated, that was all BS on my part.
Again, I was strongly motivated by the novelty/demo factor, and I
wanted to see what I could do to take Edi out.  And I was utterly
convinced Mark was with me.  The old, ``The greatest volume of
exchanged press==loyalty" schtick completely took me in.

<p>
And also of course, Mark completely snookered me.

<p>
I recall seeing the S1901 moves.  I told a buddy of mine, ``Well, so
much for this demo game.  I'm meat."  I would feel a bit less
doomsaying in the future, but I was quite demoralized after seeing
Mark neatly eviscerate my position.  I was so convinced he wouldn't
stab me!  The volume of messages we exchanged, the traditional
difficulty Russia has opening strongly against Turkey, my desire to
nail Edi to the wall and the paranoia I attempted to foment against
him with Mark, they all convinced me I was solid.  How wrong I was!

<p>
In any event, after my S1901 failed so disastrously, I had to fall
back upon experience and a bit of fast-talk desperation.  I approached
my old buddy Edi, pulled the nostalgia card, apologized humbly for my
fuck-ups, and pledged my eternal, undying support.  All I wanted,
ostensibly, was to get back a little bit at Mark.  I utilized my
standard ``toady" line, and while I suspect Edi saw right through that,
it nevertheless panned out as Edi didn't move decisively against me.
He rather made some novel moves which <i>could</i> have been used in a
devastating fashion against me in S1902, but which didn't overly hurt
me in F1901.  That was fine with me; Edi straddling the fence was much
better for me than Edi taking the hammer to me.

<p>
F1901 was also spent trying to patch things up with Mark (read: me
begging Mark to pull off).  We once again exchanged dozens of
kilobytes of text, and he again promised to go with me.  This time,
though, I wasn't buying, and I decided to take the safe moves which
would hopefully maintain my position and defend against Russia.  The
tone of my messages to mark would also set the tenor for my later
diplomatic strategy with him, one that would ultimately prove
successful.

<p>
I defended against Mark's greed, and then fell back into Fortress
Turkey mode.  All the while, I was hoping against hope that Edi would
succumb to nostalgia and recollection of good past experiences with
me, so that we could work together against Mark.

<p>
Happily, Russia stabbed Edi shortly thereafter.  This was a rather
large blunder on Mark's part, IMO.  He stabbed too many people, at too
many dangerous times.  I think he was taken by the ``demo" aspect of
the game.  Now, demos are all well and good, but even if you want to
try something different, you should still always keep sight of the end
goal, and utilize worthwhile strategies.  You can't expect reckless
strategies to work, especially not in an experts' game.

<p>
Edi was then pushed into my camp, because of Mark's stab.  I of course
marketed myself as the only reliable ally, and again pledged eternal
loyalty and support and toadiedom.  All the while, I was still
conducting a diplomatic onslaught against Mark.

<p>
The strategy I adopted was one of absolute bluntness and truthfulness.
I played the ``wounded victim" schtick up to the hilt, and took an
amazingly self-righteous tone.  You see, I had noticed that Mark
appeared to avoid taking personal responsibility for his actions,
preferring instead to blame it all on Edi.  ``Edi made me do it" was a
rather common refrain, with Mark.

<p>
With this in mind, I figured that any sign of forgiveness or weakness
or general ``laid-backness" would backfire on me.  Every time I bought
into his prior acts, I got burned.  So I figured if I took a hard
line, he might stand up and take notice.  I also figured that if I
painted myself as the ever-loyal ally who always got brutally betrayed
by him, he might find my promises more credible.  ``I've never once
stabbed you" was a common refrain of <i>mine</i> to Mark.  I never let him
dodge responsibility, and I also figured that if I could make him own
up to it, and didn't let him off the hook, he might actually feel some
level of guilt and responsibility and do the ``right thing" for once.

<p>
So on the crucial Fall turn of 1902 (or was it 1903?  I forget, and
I'm trying to do this from memory, as my older game files are not
readily available) I made a tactical analysis of the board.  One
particular set of moves would guarantee that I kept all of my centers,
as well as take SEV.  I then made a full-scale diplomatic assault on
Mark so that he would make the necessary moves.  Hoping against hope,
I then crossed my fingers.

<p>
And it worked!  I blew Mark out of SEV, and my build on that turn
marked the end of my openings phase, and took me into my midgame.

<p>
[At this point, the muse passed out.  Upon rereading the above, I'm
rather amused by quite a bit of it, so I decided I'd keep it in raw
form, rather than editing.]
<i>((And I would just comment that other than Jamie's consistent
verbiage spread around to many players, the exchanges between Mark
and Hohn in total overwhelmed any other communication on the board
for sheer volume.
Boy, did they go at it.))</i>

<p>
Midgame was spent with Edi and me working solidly and steadily against
IR, with a lent French unit.  We did well at first, but then we began
to bog down.  So much so that the tide eventually turned, and Edi
began to take losses.

<p>
Somewhere during that time, there was a rather crucial exchange
between Edi and myself, concerning RUM.  Much of this was done over
the phone, but basically, the way I saw it, if I managed to convince
him to let me take RUM, I'd then be able to shed the onus of toadiedom
and begin to breathe a bit easier.  In fact, considering some of the
risks he was facing on that same turn, I might even be able to become
the dominant partner of the alliance.  After much wrangling, he
finally consented to letting me have RUM on that turn, and I knew that
I was set.  I was actually quite happy with myself, in that I'd
suspected he'd remain adamant in his desire to take/keep RUM, but I
think by that point, he'd decided to throw in with me for the long
haul, no matter what.  I felt similarly, although I was starting to
realize that the realities of the situation might require a
rearrangement in the future.  I really, really wanted to work with
Edi, because I knew he was reliable and because I knew any AT will
favor the T in the long run.

<p>
But we became stalemated, and Edi began to lose ground.  Edi, I still
disagree with you quite strongly in that I don't think staying with
you would have benefited me in the end.  I do think you're
overestimating your ability to influence our particular situation, to
be honest; France, Italy and Russia weren't budging, and hadn't shown
<i>any</i> signs that they ever would, despite several years worth of
efforts by both of us.  And if I'd granted you the support and centers
you wanted, it would have been at my expense.  And I didn't want to
jeopardize my upward trend with a downward turn, especially knowing
how cagey you are, Edi.  I was worried that you could have stabbed me
at any time, after making a deal with the others.  Giving up parts of
my position to you as you had requested was just too dangerous, and
the potential payoff was too remote and speculative; what I saw was us
getting driven back, and you can't count on being able to influence
all of the others, which is what we would have needed for you to
prosper again.

<p>
Moreover, I also of course considered you to be very dangerous, Edi,
and since I saw an opportunity to axe you while growing at the same
time, I wanted to do it.  See, I agree with most of the people here
that said that a solo victory was a very unlikely result.  Thus, I
wanted to make sure I ended up in any three-way situation.  Stabbing
you guaranteed my placing in at least a three-way, assuming France
couldn't achieve a solo (which I was genuinely concerned about for a
while).  Stabbing you also was a way of playing for the win, since
even though I suddenly became a major player and a threat for the win,
I knew France was matching me, at least initially.  Since the only way
to get to a solo is to get those 18 centers, I figured I'd have to
start moving, especially considering the threat of France.  I knew
stabbing Edi was one way of growing toward that 18 center victory.

<p>
Jamie said that he thought that after I stabbed Edi, my chances of
winning were low.  Of course they were low.  In a game like this, the
fact that I or anyone came close was remarkable in itself; I fully
expected a three-way result from the start.  Good players wouldn't
allow for any other result, for the most part, under most
circumstances.  The thing I dispute is that I don't think staying with
Edi would have increased my chances of a solo.  At max, even if we
assume Edi was able to get out of the stalemate situation he was in,
even if he managed to stave off FIR's push and recover some ground, I
figure we'd only be able to make it up to 11/11 or 12/12 before we
reached our maximum realistic extent.  Then I could have stabbed, but
the other thing that helped me make my decision to stab Edi was some
words from Edi himself, where he said that we could grow to a decent
size and then ``hopefully force a concession."  I don't think Edi
realized this was a DIAS game, which makes everything different in
terms of end-game strategies.  The vast majority of FTF games are won
by concession, but not DIAS games.  As soon as someone pointed that
out to him, I strongly suspected Edi would be much more wary and on
guard against me, because there would be no easy concessions; one of
us would likely have to stab the other.  And since I didn't know when
someone would clarify this point to Edi, I wanted to strike while the
iron was hot, and when he least expected me to stab him.  Stabbing Edi
when he is on guard is a difficult proposition, after all, and should
be avoided whenever possible. :)

<p>
I was very happy with the turn that I stabbed Edi.  That turn also
involved a stab of Cal, and it worked out perfectly, such that Edi
went down three while Cal maintained (I think).  Every move worked out
exactly as I'd hoped, and I knew I was in the three-way, and possibly
might even get a two-way or a solo.

<p>
The endgame was rather simple, straightforward and brief.  Edi stayed
alive longer than I'd hoped, and there was the judge e-mail fiasco
that caused such disruption between Cal's and my moves.  I believe my
chances of winning would have been better had we been able to either
beat Edi down more quickly, or had we been able to coordinate better
on the judge fiasco turn.  My reasoning for this was that if I had
been one turn faster on getting to the Med, I might have been able to
blow into MID myself, rather than needing Cal's assistance (assistance
which Cal wisely decided to withhold...it was very tantalizing to be
so close to blowing into the MID, but having Cal refuse to do so).
And if I'd made it into MID, I feel confident I would have won.

<p>
As a result of that, it was just a question of who would be in the
final draw.  I had one last card or two to try, though, and things
were closer than I'd thought they would be.

<p>
I'd always planned on stabbing Cal, but the question was how to do it
without overly jeopardizing my position, because I was genuinely
worried about John winning, for a long time, perhaps longer than I
should have been worried.  I think it was a bit of paranoia on my
part.  As I've said, France is the only nation I like to play more
than Turkey, and I tend to overestimate France's chances in most games
I play in.

<p>
An opportunity did present itself, though, and not coincidentally that
opportunity presented itself at about the same time that I would be
able to make one final push for victory.  So I stabbed Cal for the
three centers (I was also happy about that; I'd assumed for a long
time that I would only be able to get two from him on the turn of my
stab, but as a result of moves that Cal himself proposed, I was able
to finagle three), and moved into position in the north.

<p>
Now, had Pitt acted the way that <i>I</i> would have acted, I would have
won this game.  Basically, I view any elimination as an elimination.
If I'm not in the final draw, who cares whether the end result is a
solo or a three-way for the others?  In fact, if I've been stabbed by
someone such that it results in my own demise, I'll do my damnedest to
try to throw the game to the non-stabber.  This builds credibility for
my not infrequent throw-game-leverage threats, and it shows people
that stabbing poorly (since of course, any stab of <i>me</i> must be a poor
decision, right? ;) ) has certain consequences.

<p>
In this game, John had brutally stabbed Pitt on more than one
occasion, as had Jamie at least once, I believe.  And they were
unquestionably about to make the final stab which would cut down on
the draw size, too.  Everyone knew it.  The writing was on the wall.
Meanwhile, I had never once stabbed Pitt, and had supported him on a
number of occasions.  So I thought I'd be on pretty reasonable grounds
to ask Pitt to move STP-FIN, and support me in STP in the fall if he
got into FIN.  If he'd done that, I'd have won.

<p>
I was surprised, though, when he flatly rejected me.  He knew that he
was going out, but he still wouldn't let me win.  I was disappointed,
and although normally I would have tried to sway him, from his tone I
knew that he wasn't going to do it.  So I pulled back defensive and
established my stalemate line (well, actually I was a bit forward of
the stalemate line, as a sort of offensive defense).  And then it was
over.  John and I exchanged a few perfunctory e-mails about a two-way,
but I suspected he'd back off of that proposal, and he did.  Then we
called it.

<p>
The keys to this game for me were the three crucial turns that I
describe above, first the taking of SEV, then the stab of Edi, and
finally the stab of Cal.  Each marked the passing of a game phase for
me, from openings to mid to end.  And even though I wasn't able to
pull off the solo, even though the game ended up a three-way like we
all had suspected, I'm happy with the way this game turned out,
especially considering my beginnings.  I'll take a 17-center three-way
with a few ``almost wins" any day, especially among this crowd.

<p>
I had a great time, and I salute all of my esteemed colleagues.  My
only regrets are that Pitt wasn't able to participate more fully (for
obvious reasons; and I hope things get better soon), and that Mark
seemed to have some hard feelings about the game.  Regardless, I hope
to see you all again in another game.  And Edi, I hope I haven't
completely torched my credibility with you...this was just an anomaly,
I swear it! :)

<p>
(EDI WROTE): If you had not stabbed me I felt fairly secure that I 
could continue in the balance act between Germany and France to the 
extent that would have allowed us as an alliance to breakthrough any 
western stalemate line.  

<p>
(HOHN REPLIED): Didn't John stab Pitt on the same turn I stabbed you?  
If so, that defeats your argument of any kind of ``balancing act" 
existing between F and G.

<p>
(EDI WROTE): Austria still showed some substantial influence there.  
Your stab took away that influence from the East and replaced it 
with an obvious and overbearing front runner.  

<p>
(HOHN REPLIED): John was also doing quite well, and as the board did 
<i>not</i> unite against me right after I stabbed, 
I feel your claim here is also erroneous.  
Sure, I was a front runner, but then to get to 18, you
eventually have to show your stuff.

<p>
(EDI WROTE): If there were the two of us in the East we could easily have
parlayed our mutual reputations to continue to dominate the board
diplomatically as well as militarily as the rest would still be in 
tension over the prospects of either one of us stabbing the other.

<p>
(HOHN REPLIED): You are speaking with the benefit of complete knowledge 
and hindsight here, Edi.  Sure, <i>you</i> know that you weren't planning 
to stab me, and that if we'd been able to get you out of your predicament, 
that you would have stayed with me.
I didn't know that for sure, not by any stretch.  I know how good you
are, Edi, and even though we've always worked well together in FTF
games, DIAS PBEM is a very different beast.  I was always concerned
with the stab from you.  So when an opportunity presented itself to
take you out, I took it.  And I don't think it was a bad decision, not
at all.

<p>
(EDI SAID): This would have allowed you to have a better opportunity 
for a stab later with a chance for victory or even a two way draw 
with myself or one of the other Western powers.

<p>
(HOHN REPLIED): A two-way between you and me would have been impossible, 
based on geography.  As for stabbing you for the win, I suppose that if
everything worked out perfectly, that would have been possible, but my
estimates of the probability of that happening differ from yours,
apparently.

<p>
(ENGLAND): I have a couple of things to say about Hohn's comments.
First, about Pitt's ending: ``In this game, John had brutally stabbed 
Pitt on more than one occasion, as had Jamie at least once, I believe.''
Never, though I had *been* stabbed by Pitt more than once.
I sure would have stabbed him if I'd had a chance, but I never did get one!
(Until the last year, of course.)

<p>
(HOHN SAID): And they were unquestionably about to make the final
stab which would cut down on the draw size, too.
Everyone knew it.  The writing was on the wall.

<p>
(JAMIE REPLIED): I wonder why you thought this was so obvious.

<p>
(HOHN SAID): So I thought I'd be on pretty reasonable grounds
to ask Pitt to move STP-FIN, and support me in STP
in the fall if he got into FIN.  If he'd done that, I'd have won.

<p>
(JAMIE REPLIED): Yes, you would have won.
If Pitt had been completely on top of things, he probably would have thrown
it to you then. But, if he were really completely on top of things, he
wouldn't have let the game *get* to that stage. (I explained this a bit in
my eog statement.)
I was counting on this fact, myself.

<p>
(HOHN to EDI): Didn't John stab Pitt on the same turn I stabbed you?

<p>
(JAMIE REPLIED): Yes, the stabs were simultaneous. 
In 1905. (I can't remember which season, though. I can check on Monday.)

<p>
(WHEN HOHN SAID): If so, that defeats your argument of any kind of ``balancing
act" existing between F and G.

<p>
(JAMIE REPLIED): It kind of does, doesn't it?

<p>
(STILL HOHN to EDI): As for stabbing you for the win, I suppose that if
everything worked out perfectly, that would have been
possible, but my estimates of the probability of that
happening differ from yours, apparently.

<p>
(JAMIE ASKED): Just out of curiosity, what do you think the chance was?
I would factor into two elements. First, there is the chance that you and
Edi could have beaten whatever westerners resisted you. And second, there is
the chance that *given you could overcome the westerners together*, you
rather than Edi would have gotten the win. (The final chance is the product
of those two factors.)
My view is that the first of these two was very low, but the second was
fairly high. (In fact, one reason I think the first is low is that the
second is so high!)

<p>
(WHEN HOHN ASKED): Edi, I'd be interested, then, in how you would have 
gone about achieving the rules change in the game we just played.

<p>
(EDI REPLIED): If I had achieved 18 centers in a spring move and 
then turned around to you and said either vote for a two way to Hohn and 
I or face being a loser in a
win you would have gone along with the 2 way...and Hohn knows that I would
have voted for it also just to make a point.

<p>
(jserandos of pipeline.com as OBSERVER): Why would that make me, 
a hapless power not being offered a spot in the
draw, go along with it?  What do I care if Hohn adds one more success to his
career?  Remember, you have to get everyone to agree, not the just the happy
few being offered a spot in the winner's circle.

<p>
(ENGLAND SAYS): Aha! 
A great recipe for making everyone vote for a two-way draw.

<p>
<i>Step One</i>: get to 18 centers in a Spring move, 
making sure that nobody could take any of them back in the Fall.

<p>
<i>Step Two</i>: propose draw.

<p>
<i>Step Three</i>: vote for draw.

<p>
I'm going to try this next game I play. Of the three steps, two seem quite
simple indeed!

<p>
(EDI REPLIES): Each person has his values and what is important in the 
event that he does not win.  
In John's case I think HE would agree.  In your case maybe
another approach is needed.   There is an old saying from the sixties on
Diplomacy: it is the seven pieces around the table that are more important
than the 34 pieces on it.

<p>
(JAMIE GETS THE LAST WORD): Now I'm getting shivers down my spine. 
The last time someone called me a
'piece', well, let's just say in the end I married her.

<p>
(YOUR BOOBISH GM): Actually, more comments surely will follow next time.
Any comments from the postal readers of the szine will be cheerfully
accepted and printed.

(OFFICIAL FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE QUOTE OF THE SEASON): ``Morality trains the
individual to be a function of the herd and to ascribe value to himself
only as a function.
The conditions for the preservation of different communities were
very different; hence there were very different moralities.
Considering essential changes in the forms of future herds and communities,
states and societies, we can prophesy that there will yet be
very divergent moralities.
Morality is herd instinct in the individual."
Part of Aphorism 116 of Book Three of <i>The Gay Science</i>.

<p>
(R.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;EMERSON - F.&nbsp;NIETZSCHE): ``...And I confess to some pleasure
from the stinging rhetoric of a rattling oath in the mouths of
truckmen and teamsters.
How laconic and brisk it is by the side of a page of the 
<i>North American Review</i>.
Cut these words and they would bleed; they are vascular and alive;
they walk and run.
Moreover they who speak them have this elegancy, that they do not trip in
their speech.
It is a shower of bullets, whilst Cambridge men and Yale men correct
themselves and begin again at every half sentence.''

<p>
(JOHN BOY-BOOB): I always thought this Emerson piece would be a great
dig at William Buckley - the arrogant ass - but Nietzsche will do.
I love the bleeding words thing.
By the way, could ya' send me Daf's address?
Thanks!
<i>((John, these literally are the last words of the szine as I
type it and the address ain't handy.
Daf is at precisely the same address in Renton as she has had for
the last ten years.
I presume they don't let you keep lots of records, so you have that
from the past.
If I forget later, remind me again.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note Richard Weiss' new address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TUR-BOOB): Can't you follow simple logic.  
Do I have to explain everything.
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork, now I have you in my clutches....))</i>
Okay, the ``darwinianly successful" .... oh, it loses something in the
translation.  Jeeesues:  no wonder you can't follow simple logic, you don't
even have a single street address.  But, why the hell is Germany asking
about living next to 666?  More than half the time 664 is next to 666.  	

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): Just for fun, I'll pretend that you don't know 
the reason.... let's just suppose you are right.
So what?
Can't Germany still ask??
What if there is no 666, how would he know if he didn't ask???

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): You should have considered the 666 question as 
equilization of abuse.
If not we can play on this one some more?	

<p>
(TUR-YNAMREG): Is there a 1720 or a 1724 Quail Circle street address?  
And, if so, how do you feel living next door?  And, who lives there?  
Are you sure you aren't an American, and an Ugly one at that, 
by asking Mr. Boob-nuts such a personal question?  
<i>((Actually, he (and you) are just verifying your rights to abuse
each other, guaranteed by your continued abuse of me.))</i>
I could understand your asking Mikey Barno since you played 
with him once in college (you words, not mine), but the esteemed Booby?

<p>
(BARNO to JONES): I was glad to read your press last issue.
I had gotten the wrong idea from your previous press, of which
I had noted: a question about crossgame press, prompting me to
write some, to which you responded with negatives about Richard
and me; one item which used the news-story format to accuse 
Richard of homosexuality and sodomy; a bunch of repetitions of
``anyone who won't vote for the draw is an idiot''; and an item
denigrating me based on incorrect information as to whether I'd won.
The tone of your most recent, more serious item is more appreciated.
Jim writes banter to stir people up and to inflict puns on us, but I've never
seen him misattribute an item.
In fact that's been a point of discussion here, and Jim has shown more
concern for it than most people.
I may not place my faith in Richard's shooting skills, and he'd stab
me if a game situation called for it, but I have faith in him over more
important matters.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): As you slice up your Austrian ally you also 
are concerned about my trust in an alliance?
I always do exactly what I promise.	

<p>
(TUR-FRA): I always wanted to get into a three-player end game where each
player was trying to win.  This is the pure essence of diplomacy and of
tactics.  This is the basics of the game.  Can one of us win?  Will 
this be like the scenario in <i>1984</i> by Orwell in which there 
are three world powers and they keep rewriting history to convince 
the masses that ``they have always been allied with Turkey and 
enemies of Germany" (to start working on the subconscious, 
just an example, heh, heh, heh).  Come on, imagine this
as fun.  How far can you go?  How far could any of us go?  I plumb
guarantee that you can still lose this.  And, if you sit there like a
ninny, whining about this not being fun, you will.  I have no idea (that
says it all, ``I have NO idea", but that is besides the point), what value
you have or what your goals are.  I have no idea how you evaluate a game. 
Would losing as the smallest country but seeing a big-mouthed, idiot
standby like me lose, would that be as satisfying as being in a 4-way draw?
Do you only want out now and don't care how?  Come on an lighten up,
relax, let's have fun.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): Thanks for the press.
I have been working overtime too, the 1998 budget.
Try to slip into the Western Med if you see an opening.	

<p>
(RICHARD-HAROLD AND CHARLES): You guys are my Christmas present from the
hobby.  Make no mistake about this game.  I am having fun.  I am sorry if
either of you are not.  If you would like me to not be obnoxious in print,
tell me, I will change.  However, I am very serious that this is an
extremely interesting end-game and one which rarely comes along.  We can
play the ultimate Dip end-game here.  It could go on forever, true, but the
tension as one person gets a little too large and whether or not we can
each adjust, kiss and make-up and then go on for selfish goals while being
forced to collaborate, that is why I play.  
Let's all have fun, however we define it.  
<i>((Amen to that!!))</i>	

<p>
(TUR-BLARNEY BARNO):  Did you read what that dude said about you.  Keep you
F'ing press out of this game.  That could wreak havoc on JimBob's printing
costs if you start writing stories, or get into one of those other ``let's
pass the winter in Yellowstone, I haven't been outside the house for 16
days and there are no more humans to eat" kind of moods.

<p>
(BARNO to JONES): By the way, when I published a Dipzine (1979-83),
I picked up orphaned games and carried subzines, to help some hobbyists
keep going and help others try bigger involvement.
When many of the people with whom I attended housecons got really nasty
(the same feud that drove Doug Beyerlein from the hobby around the
same time), and I stopped publishing, I arranged the transfer of the games
and subscriptions to one of the subzine editors.
I frequently standby for hard-to-fill variants as well as regular
and gunboat games.
(This isn't to brag, now that you're no longer questioning my 
credentials; rather, it's to provide support for the idea that
we'd get along fine.
Especially if you'll join me in [whispered] a secret alliance
to abuse Jim-Bob.)

<p>
1) An FG draw has been proposed.
Please vote with your Winter orders.
Remember, if you don't vote, it cannot pass. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BERLIN to FORMER RUSSIAN ARMY IN BULGARIA): What, did you take Houdini
lessons?

<p>
(RUSSIA IN EXHILE-WESTERN DRIVEL): If <i>only</i> the <i>proper</i> orders
hadn't been ``lost in the ether''.
Oh my - woulda-coulda-shoulda-iff'n.
And I'm still here.

<p>
(STEVE to JIM-BOB): Hey, can I go ahead and build now?  I've got a couple
of home dots free.

<p>
(BOOB to STEVE): And you can hold a few of those builds for the future
too.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD):  I won my Rotisserie league this year, and the
banquet was last night.  I think I still smell vaguely like chocolate goo,
despite a thorough shower afterwards.  Too bad Sondra is in New York;
she might actually like it.

<p>
And a P.S. to Providence:  I bet you guys in that fantasy league of
Caruso's are a bunch of pantywaists.  You play with historical statistics,
right?  Any damn fool can do that.  The hard part is deciding who will do
well next year.
<i>((Nope. 
We most definitely do NOT play with historical statistics.
We have the same problem of deciding who will do well or poorly next
year, although I admit the decision algorithms are a bit screwy.
I have to build in the effects of my ballpark (a hitters park) 
weighted against my defense (far and away the best in the league).
Under that scenario, pitchers from other teams do best while keeping
my pitchers from year to year is very risky.
On top of that, when the real player retires from the real leagues,
he's gone from our league.
So I do have to decide who will hang on next year and who will not.
I have to hang on whether Deion Sanders will come back and whether
anyone will be insane enough to sign Wade Boggs.))</i>

<p>
(JOHN BOY-KARL): Man, I hate that it was you.
I still feel guilty over that stab I pulled on you several years ago.

<p>
(BERLIN to LONDON):  Don't tell me I can tie up more than half 
of your units in
the east while James slides down your chimney to surprise the wife and
kids.  Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.

<p>
(RUSSIA-TURKEY): Can't tell for sure but I'd say France wants the solo -
no matter what's said in the passion of the moment.

<p>
(FRANCE to WORLD):  Just vote for the FG draw and let's move on to
other games.  We are enjoying steamrolling over you all, but the
outcome is certain.  Vote ``Yes" now and you survive - you won't get a
vote later.

<p>
(RUSSIA-FRANCE): Never pity this player my friend - I'll jump up and bite
ya'!

<p>
(ARMY WALES to LONDON): It's true, Britain is nice this time of year.
Don't worry - we are just stopping by for a brief visit.  If we do
decide to stay don't worry, look how well we have treated Italy.  I
bet it is time to play guessing games.

<p>
(FRANCE to AUSTRIA):  It looks like you will hold on for another year.
Sorry if you were hoping to be out of your misery now.  If you don't
want to carry on, retreat to Albania.

<p>
(RUSSIA-JAMES): I feel better now that you proved it wasn't a lock from
the start.
Now, prove you know how it was meant to be played.
Hint-hint!

<p>
(FRANCE AND GERMANY to AUSTRIA): Is it OK if we take your last home dot
now?

<p>
(JOHN BOY-BOOB): I <i>love</i> these guys!!
