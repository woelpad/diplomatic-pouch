<p><br><p><br>  ``But I misunderstood; I thought she was saying, `Good luck';
She was saying `Goodbye'." - Richard Thompson.
Ghod Quote courtesy of Eric Coffey!
Thanks, Eric.
Special bonus ``Jim-Boob Brownie Points" if you write something about
Ghod that might or might not include telling us about where this
quote may be found.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>``Down by the river, near the railroad tracks;

<p>
I saw my baby, she was dressed in black;

<p>
Down by the warehouse, where nobody goes;

<p>
I tried to tell her, but she wouldn't know.

<p>
She's over there, I'm everywhere;

<p>
Up in the air everything is, up in the air.''

<p>
From ``Up in the Air'' - one of the great unknown songs of the 90's -
by one of <i>TAP</i>'s resident musical geniuses, Mark Cutler.
This is one of those songs (like many of the above Ghod's songs) that
still makes my cry when I hear it (especially live, as I heard it today,
and decided to print these lyrics again).
You may find this hidden gem on 1995's <i>Mark Cutler and Useful Things</i>,
which is Potters Field recording PFR-2122.
The pictures on the CD are of the area described in the song above.
I still cry, but luckily when I've walked there I haven't lost MY
baby dressed in black.... the rest of the song isn't exactly an upper.

We also welcome <i>Dead Poets Society</i>, the newest subszine by

We now have FOUR - count 'em - FOUR subszines here in <i>TAP</i>.
Unfortunately for you E-Mail subbers, only Mark Lew's <i>e-Benzene</i>
appears in the E-Mail version.
Pete is trying to figure out how he will make his accessible
(if you can convert it to html format, Pete, I can put it with
<i>TAP</i> on the web page...) and Peter Sullivan already has
his on his web page (E-Mail Pete at peter of manorcon.demon.co.uk)

I cannot tell you how proud and pleased I am to have Pete Gaughan
in these pages and how happy I am for Pete in the sense that
this subszine is an indicator of improvements in his personal life,
some of which he tells you about in this first issue.
I hope this relationship can work for quite some time.
Arsenic and Old Farts is truly an amazing Diplomacy game.
Watch it.
Yes, so we are becoming a bit of a complicated institution here,
but I think it is good for the postal hobby.
New szines also are finally poking out of the woodwork.
I really mean it, I see no reason why postal Dip is dead, although
I can't see anyone doing a szine without E-Mail access.
There very definitely is a market for the ``long deadline'' games
that will continue to be the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the postal hobby.
What does raise questions is what Hasbro is going to do with Dip.
More on that below....

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
I am going to defer rate increases for the moment, but
only until the current series of game starts is completed.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

First off, here's a couple of ``big items'' from the hasbro mailing list...

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Keith Ammann (Thu, 6 Aug 1998 14:45:00)</b> 

<p>
<p>
<center>FROM DIPLOMACY TO MONOPOLY [Playtime, Aug. 6, 1998]</center><br>

<p>
Every time I vow to myself to make this column less board-game-centric,
something outrageous happens in the industry, and this time is no
exception: On Tuesday word was leaked that the Avalon Hill Game Company,
manufacturer of the world's most popular wonky war games, had been bought
lock, stock and barrel for $6 million by Hasbro, which then went and
sacked Avalon Hill's entire staff.

<p>
The news set the Internet newsgroup rec.games.board on fire. Comments
ranged from the mournful  ``There are thousands of people who became
gamers because they saw an Avalon Hill game. . . . Without Avalon Hill,
every single game company might suffer") to the pessimistic (``My guess is
that Hasbro will take the few good titles and let the rest die a slow
death") to the bitter (``Avalon Hill was an industry leader in the American
trend toward pushing adult board games into a ghetto, closing the gates
and burning the ghetto to the ground").

<p>
Without a doubt, Avalon Hill was hurting. In its annual report, dated July
29, parent company Monarch Avalon attributed three years of losses to its
game publishing division and stated an intention to ``reduce operations in
the games business," although it claimed not to have any specific plans
yet. I guess when Hasbro came knocking, Monarch Avalon didn't need much
convincing.

<p>
As for Hasbro - well, see what you think about this. It's the largest toy
and game company in the United States. In addition to the Hasbro mark, it
owns Parker Brothers, Milton Bradley, Tonka, Nerf, Kenner, Playskool,
Wham-O and OddzOn (maker of the Koosh Ball), and it's in the midst of
acquiring Tiger Electronics. It made $3.2 billion in revenues in 1997 -
1,000 times Avalon Hill's total sales. It sells almost 90 percent of its
games through Toys 'R' Us, Wal-mart and Kmart, and it's not known for
being attentive to independent retailers. It's in so tight with Toys `R'
Us that when the superstore decides it can't support a game anymore
(recent examples include Mille Bornes, Pit and Samurai Swords), Hasbro
drops it from its line.

<p>
The Hasbro tradition, inherited from Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley,
is to buy games with proven track records and coast on them. Scrabble,
Trivial Pursuit, Yahtzee, Mille Bornes, Jenga, Ouija, even flagship game
Monopoly were all bought (or, in some cases, ripped off) from outside
designers.

<p>
Avalon Hill never published bestsellers. Avalon Hill published dozens of
obscure, often complicated games that a very small number of very isolated
people HAD TO HAVE. Diplomacy. Civilization. History of the World. Wooden
Ships &amp; Iron Men. Third Reich. Squad Leader. Acquire (ironically, acquired
from 3M's game division when it tanked in the early '80s).

<p>
If player loyalty and intensity of demand make a game a success, Avalon
Hill was undeniably successful. But in terms of sales figures - which I
suspect is the standard Hasbro goes by - it was a wash. So the
conventional wisdom is that Avalon Hill has been boarded and will now be
looted and scuttled.

<p>
Losing Avalon Hill doesn't spell the imminent end of war game publishing,
but even so, I have to agree with how one r.g.b user characterized the
buyout: ``Just another step toward the brave new corporate world in which
we all go to Disney-Universal-Fox movies that we hear about on the
Microsoft-AT&amp;T data network and then go home and play the
Hasbro-Mattel-Sony computer game. Curiously, we will continue to call this
a `free market' and consider it a victory for democracy." I couldn't have
said it better myself, with or without the Noam Chomsky allusion.

<p>
See, in typical corporate fashion, despite being America's No. 1 game
manufacturer, Hasbro has absolutely no interest in what makes a good game.
I laughed in disbelief when I read in Avalon Hill's annual report,
``Competition in the games business is principally based on product quality
and features." Meaning who's got the lowest and fewest?

<p>
Take a look sometime at the design creativity and production quality that
go into the games that are being produced in Germany. There's a
renaissance going on over there, pure volcanic brilliance. But Hasbro
doesn't want to get into that stuff. When it does, it's a halfhearted sop
to the ``specialty" game sector, as when Milton Bradley bought the rights
to Flinke Pinke (by award-winning designer Reiner Knizia - in Germany,
they give the designers credit on the boxes), renamed it Quandary, did its
usual grinning-family-on-the-back packaging job and jacked the price up
from $10 to $35 to cash in on the niche market's higher average price
point. Hasbro's idea of innovation is letting the public pick a new
Monopoly token.

<p>
What really burns me is that some company COULD develop inspired games
with quality components and market them to the general public, but nobody
WILL. Even when a hobby-market company inadvertently stumbles upon the
secrets of marketing and graphic design, it has to charge inflated prices
and sell through specialty stores, because it has no access to mass
promotion and distribution. Meanwhile, the big manufacturers protest that
the public won't pay more than $30 for a game, so they HAVE to cut
corners.

<p>
Well, that's complete bullshit. The games that are taking Germany by storm
sell there, on average, for 45DM to 50DM - roughly $25 to $28. They come
with top-quality wooden, plastic and pewter - PEWTER! - playing pieces,
have mouthwatering graphics, are developed by designers who are recognized
for their work, and sell like crazy. Yet we in the States complain that if
we put the same effort into a game, we'd have to charge $40 or more for
it. America, this supposed wonder of can-do industrial ingenuity, is
totally incapable of producing a decent game and pricing it affordably.
Some free market we've got here. What a fucking victory for democracy.

<p>
And what a potential loss for the gaming world. <i>Requiescat in pace</i>, 
Avalon Hill.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Don Greenwood (Thu, 10 Sep 98 14:33:49 -0400)</b>

<p>
Dear AVALONCON enthusiast;

<p>
You are receiving this survey because you have indicated an interest in 
the continuation of the Avalon Hill gaming conference. If you object to 
receiving such material, respond with a ``remove" subject to be deleted 
from my mailing list. However, if you do take an active interest in 
AVALONCON, I urge you to take the time to respond to this survey in full. 
Not only will the questions posed determine the future course of the 
convention, the % returned will act as a gauge of support for its 
continuation.

<p>
As promised, I have petitioned Hasbro regarding its intentions for the 
continuation of AVALONCON in the wake of the sale of Avalon Hill to 
Hasbro. During my recent visit to their Beverly, MA campus I stressed the 
need for immediate action if we were to preserve our facility at the Hunt 
Valley Inn for 1999. To their credit, they have responded in a timely 
fashion - thus resulting in this poll. 

<p>
Allow me to inject at this point that Avalon Hill fans should be thankful 
for the Hasbro buyout. The acquiring company usually is painted as the 
heavy in such takeovers, but from my perspective Hasbro is very much the 
white knight in this story. The infusion of their resources and marketing 
savvy promises to save many of the classic titles that were otherwise 
headed for oblivion. My understanding is that not only will they convert 
many of the AH games to the computer, but that they will continue to 
produce the best of the boardgames. And more importantly, they will be 
reissued with state of the art graphics and components that could only be 
described as ``lavish" by AH standards. I am extremely pleased that some 
of my favorite games will not only survive, but be made available to a 
far greater audience in an improved format. When I was fired by Avalon 
Hill, I was sitting on no less than eight fully developed games that 
languished with no hope of publication due to lack of proper graphic 
support. Those restrictions are now gone. Far from being the end of 
wargaming as we know it, I believe our hobby stands on the threshold of a 
new golden age where quality will again reign supreme. 

<p>
That said, I regret to report that Hasbro has decided not to continue 
AVALONCON and will not sell me the trademark so that I may do so. Their 
decision is not unexpected and makes perfect business sense. They do not 
want to detract from the prominence of GENCON by sponsoring a competing 
conference. It is their preference that AVALONCON enthusiasts be 
encouraged to attend GENCON instead. 

<p>
While I am disappointed by their decision, I respect it and applaud them 
for resolving the matter in a timely fashion. I certainly understand the 
corporate preference for a dominant trade show, and while I would argue 
that AVALONCON is not a trade show, the difference is not something I 
would expect them to appreciate. Certainly the size and grandeur of 
GENCON surpasses anything that we could hope to emulate with AVALONCON. 

<p>
Nevertheless, I do not share their enthusiasm for the larger trade shows 
which strike me as being more about corporate sales than true gaming - at 
least from the viewpoint of the competitive boardgamer - whose activities 
take a back seat to the marketing of new products.  Having not 
experienced the comradery of an AVALONCON or the sense of achievement in 
winning a national event against a large field of players, I'm sure 
AVALONCON came off as the small potatoes it is in a corporate sense. 
Fortunately, Hasbro has not requested that we cease doing our own thing 
provided we do not refer to it as AVALONCON or the Avalon Hill National 
Championships. And that, dear reader, is why you need to take the time to 
answer the following survey ... so we can judge whether to proceed along 
that course and how to do so, given these events. 
   
<p>
-------------------------

<p>
1. SHALL WE PROCEED? I can sympathize with Hasbro wanting to support one 
dominant convention. I felt the same way about AVALONCON vis a vis 
smaller regional cons. What makes a great gaming conference is the 
accumulation of many like-minded gamers playing in the events of their 
choice to provide both a sense of achievement and comradery. Smaller cons 
tend to detract from the glamour of a national conference by luring away 
those local players who only have the time or resources to attend one per 
year. Should we fold our tent and embrace GENCON as the national con of 
choice or continue doing our own thing?

<p>
[   ] Let's just call it the end of an era and book our rooms for GENCON.

<p>
[   ] Baltimore or bust!

<p>
[   ] Other:  

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
2. WHAT DO WE CALL IT? Assuming we collectively decide to continue, what 
will we call ourselves since AVALONCON is no longer available? The most 
commonly heard alternative adorns my email address and is one I find 
pretentious and embarrassing. Its only redeeming feature is its 
recognition value to our regular attendees. However, it means nothing to 
new players who we want to attract to a growing conference. My choice is 
Playercon because Avaloncon has always been first about the players who 
were the real and only stars of Avaloncon.  

<p>
[   ] Playercon

<p>
[   ] Sponsor-XCon

<p>
[   ] Other: 

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
3. WHEN CAN WE DO IT? Unfortunately, the HVI has already sold our ``first 
weekend in August" date and wants to book us later directly opposite 
GENCON which I find totally unacceptable. As much as I like the HVI as a 
site, that leaves us with the following choices:

<p>
[   ] June     [   ] July    [   ] later in August    [    ] Other: 
 
<p>
[   ] Another location first week in August     

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
4. WHAT WILL IT COST? I've always taken great pride that AVALONCON was 
the best bargain in gaming when one weighed admission against that of 
comparable conferences which charged more for less days, gave less in 
prizes, and then charged players extra for individual event fees. When 
one deducted the purchase credits for pre-registrants, it was a night and 
day comparison - at least from my viewpoint. As a point of reference, 
ORIGINS '98 charged $45 for four days plus event tickets. To be honest, I 
do not know how their prizes stacked up in comparison, but their $10 
discount for pre-registration may have been viewed superior to AH's $15 
purchase credit for pre-registration since it did not require another 
purchase. I would like whatever we do to remain the best bargain in 
gaming, but without the resources of a company to back it with sales on 
site, we may have to acknowledge reality somewhat. 

<p>
What would you be willing to pay as admission next year for the same 
convention you had in 1998 (assume five days and the same prize structure 
and pre-registration credit):

<p>
[   ] $40     [    ] $45     [    ] $50     [    ] Other: 

<p>
What would you be willing to pay as admission next year for the same 
convention you had in 1998 with no pre-registration credit:

<p>
[   ] $25     [    ] $30     [    ] $35     [    ] $40     [    ] $45     
[    ] $50

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
5. WHAT GAMES WILL WE PLAY?: Without Avalon Hill backing, many will argue 
that there is no longer a need to play only AH events. We all have 
favorite games by other manufacturers that we would like to play in this 
setting. On the other hand, many feel that the focus on AH games is what 
made AVALONCON so special. While it is true that we could generate many 
more events by opening the con up to other games, what would then make us 
any different from a smaller GENCON or ORIGINS? Wouldn't something be 
lost? I, for one, am not interested in duplicating the format of the 
bigger cons ... or any change which is a step backwards from the focus of 
what we've experienced the past eight years. One of the reasons I stopped 
going to ORIGINS years ago was because 500 events which averaged a 
handful of entrants apiece held no great attraction for me. The choices 
appear to be:

<p>
[   ] Continue events in Avalon Hill games only.

<p>
[   ] Allow events from a second company willing to act as a corporate 
sponsor - replacing the role Avalon Hill played in providing merchandise 
credits. 

<p>
[   ] Open up the convention to any event sponsored by a volunteer GM 
regardless of manufacturer.

<p>
[   ] Other:

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
6. WHAT SPONSOR WOULD YOU PREFER? Given your choice of companies to be a 
sole exhibitor, add their products to our tournaments, and redeem awards 
for their merchandise, who would you prefer?

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
7. WHAT WILL WE PLAY FOR? Assuming no appropriate corporate sponsor can 
be found, what should replace their merchandise certificates?

<p>
[   ] An equal amount of cash

<p>
[   ] Replace the prize structure with plaques for all prize winners - 
not just the champs

<p>
[   ] Other: 

<p>
-------------------------

<p>
I'd like to again thank those of you who took the time to send me words 
of encouragement and pledges of support, both monetary and otherwise, to 
continue AVALONCON. I'm sure that your heartfelt expressions impacted 
Hasbro officials nearly as much as they have me and played no small role 
in their enthusiasm for reviving Avalon Hill boardgames. To the many who 
have asked what you can do to help, I offer the following:

<p>
1. STAY IN TOUCH: Put my email address in your address books and notify 
me asap when either your email or snail mail address changes. 

<p>
2. SPREAD THE WORD: It seems trite, but it is true now more than ever. 
The convention needs word of mouth advertising to survive. If everybody 
that stopped to tell me what a great con AVALONCON was tried to persuade 
one other person to attend we would have no problems. Mention us on line. 
Tell people what convention is worth attending. Encourage people to get 
on our mailing lists ... especially email. Send a copy of this survey to 
any gamer you know who might be interested who has not already received 
it. Ask your gaming friends if they have received this, and if they are 
interested, send them a copy. If they're not on line, give them a 
printout to return. This convention was borne out of a longing for the 
good old days and the realization that nobody cared as much about your 
hobby as you do. It's still true. If you want it to continue, you will do 
something to help, rather than lamenting its loss. 

<p>
3. VOLUNTEER: If you'd be good at running an event, join our cadre of GMs 
who make a difference. While I'm not interested in adding more events per 
se, I'd rather see bigger events than more 8-player mini-events of 
out-of-print games, every GM can use assistants. Volunteer for the games 
you'd be qualified to run ... especially if you're unhappy with how it 
has been run in the past. 

<p>
4. BOARDGAME PLAYERS ASSOCIATION: While I'm flattered by the number of 
people who have expressed a willingness to invest money to see AVALONCON

kind. However, donations of time and expertise in such matters as

I propose to continue the GM quarterly newsletter and voting input of the 
GMs in any new conference. In essence, I advocate replacing the AH 
Advisory Board with the Boardgame Players Association which would 
attract, I assume, most of the same people ... the folks dedicated enough 
to volunteer their time as GMs. Membership would require yearly dues of 
$50 payable by February 28th and entitle members to free admission at the 
conference.

Hi Jim,

<p>
Thanks for the mention in TAP. So I am the "real deal" eh? :) But you forgot
to print my address, at least in my copy. You wrote: "Heath's address is The
rest of you should send him a subscription." But thanks for the mention,
nevertheless.
<i>((And see? 
You did it again!
You brought it up and DID NOT write your postal address in here, so I have
to go look it up.
And it isn't right here at my fingertips.
I'll try to remember to go look it up and put it in here, but I make no
guarantees.
Admit it, this is just a trick so that I mention you every issue!))</i>

<p>
Are you going to the Rubicon Games? Or are you too far away to attend? I
believe I will attend.

<p>
I will be driving next month. Finally. I'm looking forward to that - and I
bet I am the only zine editor that is under 18 and doesn't drive. If I had
started Driver's Ed earlier, like when I was 14 or something (instead of
starting when I am closer to 16) I would be doing great, but I am just in it
now. 

<p>
So, what's up with these 'desert island lists'? Can I send one? How 'bout
explaining it so I can participate?

<p>
And I'd ask some advice of you as well. I plan to print NE for a long time.
Decades, hopefully, if all goes well. But when I go off to college - I'll
want to settle in before I resume printing. What shall I do at that point?
Just put it on suspension? Is that common practice?

<p>
Have you received <i>NE</i> #2 yet? I hope it went over OK. Less meaty than my
first one but I've been busy.

<p>
At any rate, thanks a million for the mention and I hope to hear from you
about the desert island lists soon. Thanks.

Jim:  This note is more "for print" than any I've penned lately:
<i>((So I went ahead and lost it and didn't print it for an extra month....
go figure.))</i>

<p>
I am considering going back into publishing myself, as another of
the ``bridge" zines between the snail and electronic mediums.  
<i>((Lately, people who want to be convinced that the US postal
hobby is dying have been calling me ``primarily an E-Mail szine''

issues out or starting more games, I'll just do it by persisting.
Now other szines are starting and there's a lot of excitement 
around.
If anyone chooses not to see it, that's their problem.))</i>
I would
like to get back into writing articles on the psychological aspects of
playing The Game, and as a means of ``staying in touch" with many
people at one time.  I'd like to encourage readers, this time, to submit
their own comments/ideas on topics that I introduce-sort of a ``forum"
type of thing.
<i>((Yeah, great idea!!!  
I always thought that was the best aspect of your previous szine effort,
although it was more informal there, as I recall.))</i>

<p>
The name <i>Midlife Crisis</i> has gotten a little ``old"; one third of my
life has transpired since I published that zine!  Eric Ozog has encouraged
me to use <i>Muppet Logic</i>, an expression that he's seen me use to
describe illogical (or asinine) reasoning from time to time.  That's
okay, as long as people don't expect the name to necessarily reflect the
content....

<p>
Is this a formal announcement of the new zine?  Ah, no.  I'd like to
solicit comments from the hobby at large as to whether a new zine is
perceived as ``needed" (is the interest there?); if I reenter the pubbing
scene (that's ``publishing", not ``owning a pub", for those who wonder),
<i>((Well, when I was telling James Wall about your idea at VertigoGames
in Philly the other weekend I couldn't help but think of that.

which games should I try to run therein?  Any input will be appreciated.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
Then, I'm going to set a slate of 20 or so (perhaps more at the rate
my thinking is going) and DEMAND votes from you out there.
I may get a bit obnoxious on that score as the great freedom to work and play
will generate a responsibility to offer some opinions as we near the end of
the century.
I intend to have a lot of fun with this, and hope all of you do too.
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; ``Planet Claire'' from the B-52's is added this time;
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!),
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

<p>
The ``bullpen'' is the list of suggestions that people make
that I haven't decided whether or not to include yet.
Comments on the bullpen are, of course, actively encouraged.
I also am ``working'' on some ideas Mark Luedi tossed out last
time.
I put Gatemouth in the bullpen for now, but he will be joined by
others from that list soon.
I liked Mark's ``criteria addition" that:
``One of my own criteria for truly great songs is that it can sound as
good or better distorted as not, whether on account of poor signal, bad
speakers, tape deterioration, car noise.''

<p>
BULLPEN: ``Rocking the Casbah'' - The Clash; ``Dancing With Myself'' -
Billy Idol's Gen X; ``Walk This Way'' - Run-DMC; Prince - ``1999";
``Fire on the Mountain'' - the Grateful Dead; Devo - ``Whip It"; 
B Movie - ``Nowhere Girl"; B-52s - ``Give Me Back My Man" or 
``Rock Lobster"; ``Roadrunner'' - Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers; 
Strunz and Farrah - ``Americas''; Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown - 
``Up Jumped the Devil''; David Bowie - ``Fame''.

<p>
SPECIAL GEORGE CLINTON BULLPEN: ``I Just Wanna Testify'', ``Let's Take
It to the Stage'', ``The Pinocchio Theory'', ``Atomic Dog'', and
``Flash Light''.

<p>
SPECIAL ROLLING STONES BULLPEN: ``Midnight Rambler'', ``Satisfaction", 
``Paint It Black", ``Jumpin' Jack Flash". 

<p>
SPECIAL DRUG MUSIC BULLPEN: ``Cocaine'' - Eric Clapton's version;
``Casey Jones'' - the Grateful Dead; ``Red, Red Wine'' - UB40;
The Toys - ``Smoke Two Joints'';  
``Smoke, Smoke, Smoke (That Cigarette)'' - Commander Cody and His Lost Planet
Airmen; and I'm adding this time ``I'm an Okie from Muskogee'' -
Merle Haggard.

<p>
Jim-Bob,

<p>
Sorry you couldn't make Shorecon but I understand you're a definite for 
Vertigo games. 
<i>((I made it, I really was there!
No time this issue for a write up, but I hope to say something about it 
next time.
Let me just say, that it isn't a good con if you don't watch the sun
come up.....))</i>
You missed a good time at the shore. We had about a dozen 
people there and despite the cold weather we had a grand time on the beach 
and in Avalon. Due to time constraints Brad was not able to make the group 
pilgrimage to the Wildwood boardwalk. We did get some great baked goods at 
the local bakery for breakfast as well as Maria's excellent chicken that 
Brad cooked up on the gas grill.

<p>
Of course the highpoint of the gaming weekend was when I smashed Brad in 
Kingmaker when he gave me the Lieutenant of Ireland in a rather lame 
attempt to get rid of one of my best nobles. So I was forced to destroy 
him. Brad has been shown that he shouldn't cross me in Kingmaker. We can 
also show you the new collectable card game, Netrunner that Tom Swider and 
I are pushing. It was done by Wizards of the Coast but it is now, sadly, 
out of print. Brad hated it, but we did get Maria and Steve Courtemanche to 
play. They both enjoyed it.

<p>
Anyway I am writing to let you know that I am interested in several topics 
in the issue that I listed in the subject area of the note. (I just got 
issue 204 yesterday and haven't had a chance to read it yet.)  As for the 
issue of bribes, I agree with you that only way to solve it is to make it 
public. Diplomacy is a simple game that is controlled by the players, not 
the rules. It is up to the players to make it work.

<p>
It also highlights what I have thought for years-namely that Diplomacy is 
a terrible tournament game. A tournament game is one that minimizes 
differences in games and allows players to repeat them with no impact on 
the other games. Duplicate bridge is the ideal tournament game because it 
allows for this easily. Diplomacy is best if you simply score the player's 
best game. Yes there will be ties under this method. There are a couple of 
ways to resolve these ties. You can either allow the best players to 
playoff-although this also presents difficulties if the players don't tie 
in convenient groups of seven for the championship boards. You could simply 
accept the ties and use some other means (supply center count, time taken 
to reach a win, survivors on the board, etc., etc) to break ties.

<p>
Of course, we as a hobby could stop expecting an easy way for these ties to 
be resolved and simply accept them as part of the game. But then that would 
mean ultra-competitive turbo freaks might go home without a plaque and 
bragging rights. No, far better to sully a perfectly good game with 
meaningless point counts and silly scoring systems. And for what? For some 
artificial count that doesn't reflect the sprit of the game or this hobby. 
Good riddance, I say, to tournament scoring systems.

<p>
End rant.

<p>
I also agree with your policy on NFP letters. If you are talking about 
someone else and can't say it in public or to their face, barring some 
exceptional circumstances, you shouldn't be writing it down. Gossip is bad, 
written gossip is much worse. Feuding is usually the result of people who 
can't laugh at themselves. As you know, while I have been my share of 
disagreements, rarely do I let rise to the degree of feuding-I'd be lying 
if I said it never happened but I don't like it so I usually don't allow 
it. (And you know me, I don't even lie during Diplomacy games)
<i>((Wimp!!!))</i>

<p>
That's something else everyone should be made aware of:  No one can feud 
with you if you simply don't allow it. Usually people who are only 
interested in feuding will quickly grow bored by your lack of a good 
tantrum every so often. On the other hand if they are truly interested in a 
debate they don't need to see you have a fit to keep participating in a 
dialogue with you. If not, I don't consider losing that sort of a 
conversation a loss.

<p>
I also want to comment on Brad's discussion of George Washington. Brad, my 
friend, you're letting your Revolutionary War bias seep through here. Yes, 
Washington was a great general and political leader, although I think the 
latter was more he was what the country needed at the time rather than his 
being an objectively great political leader. However, Grant and Lee were 
certainly generals on par with Washington, especially Grant. If Grant's 
material advantage was so the only thing that mattered, why was Lee able to 
fight off other generals for three years?

<p>
Blaming Marshall and King for Soviet domination of Eastern Europe is 
lame-even for your warn out conservative ideology of the Cold War. Yalta 
wasn't about approving of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe anymore than 
the Soviets approved of US domination of Japan. It simply was a fact to be 
acknowledged. I don't think anything else much could have been done, even 
the British Imperial Staff didn't think Churchill's schemes for Balkan 
invasions had much of a chance of succeeding. Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of 
the Imperial Staff, thought most of Churchill's plans for military 
operation were hair-brained ideas and he viewed part of his job to keep 
them from getting any further than talk.

<p>
I like John Harrington's letter very much. Keep it up John and don't worry 
about not being ``well-informed" I thought you're letter sounded quite 
intelligent to me. It was especially enjoyable to hear from someone new and 
middle of the road, instead of the usual letter writers. I don't know if I 
would say that people were treated poorly in Hong Kong. It has been known 
ever since the communist took over in 1949 that they would not renew the 99 
year lease on Hong Kong. People there must have known that the British 
would be forced to leave come 1997-why were they acting so shocked when 
it happened?

<p>
I also thought a lot of that British sponsored last minute ``democracy" was 
a transparent ploy to make the Chinese look bad. Let's face it, Hong Kong 
was ruled from London, not from Hong Kong, for the last 100 years. If there 
really had been a home grown government there for say 20 or 30 years or 
more, then I might agree that Hong Kong wasn't treated very well. Patton's 
government was only about six or seven years old, as was the Hong Kong 
Assembly. I find this whole new democracy rather silly as the Chinese are 
their own worst enemies and don't need any help to look bad, yet Britain 
felt it had to construct a whole government that they knew the Chinese 
would never accept. Then the British government could beat its chest and 
say, ``Look, the bad Chinese are dismantling democracy in Hong Kong." It was 
a farce and the British people saw through it.

<p>
Finally, Hong Kong's best defense is its own prosperity. As long as it is 
making a profit then it safe from any wrath from Beijing. The Chinese 
follow the new model of ``Marxism for Profit" so they might not like Hong 
Kong but they know better than to mess with a profit making enterprise like 
Hong Kong, Inc.

<p>
I just joined BMG music club and got five free CDs. So far I've only heard 
Dire Straits greatest hits-<i>Money for Nothing</i>-and I am currently 
listening to The Cars anthology, <i>Just What I Need</i>. Very good, if dated 
tunes. I will let you know what I think of the Blues Traveler and Manhattan 
Transfer's <i>Swing</i>.

Dear Jim - Let's see, it was about six weeks ago that I predicted that
Roger Maris would keep his record for yet another year.
Hmmm, . . .
<i>((BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTT!!!
Your crystal ball has been recalled!))</i>
 
<p>
I should have stuck with my guns.  Last year, I wrote in <i>TAP</i>
that I thought the home run record would fall in 1998, when
expansion added two more teams' worth of AAA pitchers to
the major league ranks.  Didn't pick McGwire, mind you - I
probably would have guessed Frank Thomas - but at least I
got that part right.
<i>((I always thought it would be McGwire - definitely not
Griffey or Thomas or Belle (Imagine what life would have been like
had ``Joey'' been going for it??) - though Sosa has been a surprise.
I am still rooting for McGwire to take the record to 70... or at least
to 69.))</i>
 
<p>
I still think Griffey has an excellent chance to eclipse Aaron;
his 50th the other night gives him 344 for his career, and he's
just 28 years old.  He could reach 400 by the end of next
season, and if he does, look out.

You can leave me out of the drug music discussion for want
of expertise; no experience with drugs whatsoever.  I did like
``Shine On You Crazy Diamond," if that helps.  And does
Alan Parsons qualify as drug music?

<i>((Hey, she probably thinks she's ready to date and be an

never seen it on VH1, it get's heavy airplay (once every three hours)
on our local radio equivalent of VH1.
<i>((Harvey's song has been big around here all summer.  It's actually
dying down around here now.  Are you just getting it onto heavy
airplay??))</i>

<p>
No, it's been big all summer.  Which is why I had to call it ``lyric of

why I'm a jerk.

My son (6 1/2) is now very into music, and wants to listen to the

can't stand it for the very reason he craves it: their *very* tight
playlist which enables them to repeat songs every three hours.  He
likes the songs because he becomes very familiar with them, where as I
dislike the repetition.  I don't know what's worse: the lyrics he
sings along with (often racy, though he doesn't know it) or the
version of the lyrics he comes up with (and swears that's what they're
singing).
<i>((Is this stuff for print??? That's "precious"!!)</i>

You want precious:
I know you know Barney, but you may or may not know that one of

Our 6 1/2 year old even uses it as a tool to get our 3 year old to
help clean up.
Okay, here's the precious part.  Our 3 year old, always influenced by
his older brother, now sort of sings too.  His favorite song to sing is
Semi-sonic's ``Closing Time."  But he sings it ``Clean up time."

Personally, we prefer it to Barney.

Do you know what the phrase ``Zero Sum" means in game language, or systems
theory, or who coined it?  (I'm not being antagonistic here, just curious
and interested in a little educational rap along with the vulgarities.  I
promise that the answer to none of these is ``Mikey.")

<p>

<center>Richard - that's what's next - rcw of sirius.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Obviously, I pulled this out of the game to put up here in the
letter column.
I thought you knew all about the zero sum idea already?
The intuition of the idea came from work by John von Neumann and Oskar 
Morgenstern begun during WWII and continuing afterward.
I know the concept of ``zero sum'' if not the terminology originates
in their pathbreaking <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i> (1944).
Strangely enough, though, today the fundamental concept of the zero
sum is being recognized as having sent economics down a path that
perhaps was not exactly ideal.
Let me try to explain without bogging everyone down in boring irrelevancies.))

<p>
((A zero sum game is one where the beginning resources available to be
distributed to the players in the game is fixed - cannot be increased 
through the process of playing the game (though technically you can
always destroy resources, a concept called free disposal) - thus,
you can't create new resources by cooperating or any other activity.
In Diplomacy, once you start with a premise that there can be only
one winner, thinking of it as a zero sum game means that agreeing to
a two way or three way draw does not create more than one winner, it
just splits value of the single win among the drawing players.
This concept is why many scoring systems for Dip
take that ``single point" and divide it so that the total points scored
still add up to one.))

<p>
((It turns out in economics to be theoretically productive (as von
Neumann and Morgenstern pointed out), then, to separate ``production''
and ``dividing up the resources'' into separate processes where the
``game'' of dividing the resources is a ``zero sum game''.  
This assumes rational processing of information, including accounting
for the expected behavior of other players in the game.  It has,
however, turned out not to be practically productive since it has led
to an over-emphasis in economics on competition for ``zero sum resources''
at the expense of understanding the potential growth benefits of cooperation.
There are no simple answers to questions like: ``Do the technological
advances and growth that come out of having a large single corporation
like Microsoft control much of the computer systems environment outweigh
what is lost by concentrating economic power (and wealth) in Bill Gates
and a small number of `owners' of the corporation?''
This is an example where using zero sum game thinking probably has not
helped the understanding of the situation.))

<p>
((Any Diplomacy player worth their salt recognizes that the cooperation
decisions that they need to make in order to succeed at all in the game
need to be considered conjointly with their efforts to win the game
(though in some sense there are only 34 dots and one win to allocate -
a zero sum game).  
So, is Diplomacy a zero sum game, or isn't it?
Well, perhaps.
Am I making any headway, or am I just confusing you?
Anyway, more recently, in both pure game theory and in its applications 
in economics people are getting away from the zero sum concept as 
unduly limiting toward understanding the tradeoffs between production
from cooperation, production from competition, and competition for the
rewards or resources that result.
But zero sum concepts make for lots of neat and clean mathematical proofs!))

<p>
((Von Neumann, of course, was one of the most brilliant men of this century.
In addition to coming up with some of the century's most important pure
mathematical proofs, he did some of the fundamental work in developing
the atomic bomb and came up with a number of the methods and structures
that made modern computing possible.
Lots of people debate about who ``invented'' the concept of the programmable
computer as we now know it, but Von Neumann was one of the ones you can

do you get reliable answers from a computing machine with components

<p>
Movies: <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> was a fantastic movie.  Not overdone
like <i>Platoon</i>.  ``Ryan" is content to use realistic characters,
instead of exaggerated Christ imagery.  If they only had just clipped
the beginning and end from the movie (the current-day framing) it
would have been a touch better.  But it's easy enough to ignore those
scenes.  It seems the fad to be unwilling to set a movie in the past
without having some grounding in the present.  (<i>Ryan, Titanic</i>).
 
<p>
<i>There's Something About Mary</i> was riotously funny.  
<i>((Yeah, I thought so, and you didn't even catch the little Rhode
Island ``in-jokes'' that were put in there.
As people say around here, if Cameron Diaz ever really did go to
Smithfield High..... well, I really can't say in a family szine.))</i>
My only complaint
is that too many of the best parts were included in ads and previews.
The one ``zipper" scene is the grossest thing I can recall seeing in a
movie.  It was also fun to watch Jonathan Richman play, after all the
discussions we've had.
 
<p>
<i>Godzilla</i> was, well, a disappointment.  It's not that it wasn't good,
it's just that it could have so easily been so much better.  
<i>((Oh, probably it could have been better, but I still loved it.
Me and the guy in Tucson....
did I ever tell you about how Steven Spielberg's best movie is <b>1941</b>....))</i> 
Between <i>Godzilla</i> and the X-Files movie I'm worried that every SF movie in the
future will feel some need to rip off the <i>Aliens</i> series.  Oh wait,
<i>Godzilla</i> was ripping of <i>Jurassic Park</i>.  Never mind.
<i>((Ah, maybe I have it now.
Since no Steven Spielberg movie will ever equal <b>1941</b> in my eyes and I
try to avoid them wherever possible and thus have NEVER SEEN <b>Jurassic
Park</b>, perhaps THAT'S why I liked <b>Godzilla</b> so much.
It was new to me.))</i>
 
<p>
So...perhaps somebody should tell the makers of <i>Godzilla</i> how
suspension bridges work?  Those cables aren't just for show!
<i>((Yeah, well, everyone keeps outrunning fireballs too, which
also is impossible.
Let's face it, the movies are fantasy.))</i>
 
<p>
Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the failure to include the
museum scene from the preview which was so popular.

I'll bet you're getting tired of me by now. 
<i>((No, because I haven't arranged your letters in order, so
this one actually comes first!!))</i>
But I have pulled out some 
old albums (in CD form, not in vinyl). And I have some more 
suggestions:

<p>
From Paul Simon's <i>Graceland</i> album:
``The Boy in the Bubble";
``Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes";
``You Can Call Me Al".

<p>
From Rod Stewart's <i>Vagabond Heart</i> album:
``The Motown Song"; ``If Only".

<p>
From Claude Bolling's <i>Suite for Cello &amp; Jazz Piano Trio</i> (with Yo 
You Ma):
``Baroque in Rhythm"; ``Galop".

<p>
Now, I will shut up for a bit (at least until I hear some reaction to my 
suggestions)!

<p>
<i>((Well, while I enjoy the Simon album, none of those songs are really
especially compelling dance tunes.
At best, Rod Stewart makes novelty dance tunes.
And, well, I don't own the last record, but I think I've heard these songs
on the radio.
They don't make this grade, but they definitely are worth listening to!
But, hey, those are just my opinions!
I'll let your other choices below stand mostly on their own.
There are too many songs here to put them all in the Bullpen, but if
you focus on up tempo, fast dance songs and suggest only a couple,
I'll put 'em in the Bullpen.
The challenge here is to condense lists down, not to keep adding songs.
I have literally hundreds of mixed music dance tapes - well, over 100 -
lying around my house and car with a sum total of well over 1000 dance
songs.  It wouldn't be very helpful just to list all of them out.))</i>

Here are four more songs from my early morning listening, all from 
<i>Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown</i>:
``Linus &amp; Lucy", performed by David Benoit;
``Joe Cool", performed by B.B. King;
``The Great Pumpkin Waltz", a wonderful waltz - for those slow

<p>
Jim,
Now that I have a place of participation in one of your games, I 
thought it important to become a responsible participant in <i>TAP</i>'s 
community of readers. 
<i>((See????
That's why this is a POSTAL szine and not an E-MAIL szine.
When people play and take part in the POSTAL aspect of the szine,
then they write.
I've got 300 of you deadwood E-Mail readers and if I get a letter 
from one of you every six months, that's really stretching!!))</i>
My first act toward that goal is this short list 
of suggestions toward your list of great party singles. (As I am still 
going back to listen to some songs, I am sure that there will be an 
addendum!)

<p>
The first song that came to my mind was Louis Armstrong's rendition 
of ``Hellzapoppin'" from his <i>What a Wonderful World</i> album. This is 
the title song from a play that was then made into a movie of the same 
title (in 1941). I know that Jerry Lewis starred in the (a?) broadway 
production of the play at one time.

<p>
Since every good dance sequence needs some slow movers 
appropriately place let me suggest three. 
<i>((OK, but I already decided to pretty much bag the slow movers
since they are so much more subjective than the rhythm filled fast songs.
As many have said, the essence of music is rhythm - we're huntin' rhythm.))</i>
On their first and second 
albums, Chicago began with excellent songs. ``Introduction" opened 
their first album, <i>Chicago Transit Authority</i>; ``Movin' In" opened 
their second, <i>Chicago.</i> Of the two, I believe ``Introduction" to be the 
better choice for this list.

<p>
The third song appropriate for a slower piece is ``Espiegele" by Claude 
Bolling and Jean-Pierre Rampal. Bolling has produced a number of 
albums in this Jazz Suite for Piano and . . . series. This is from the 
<i>Suite for Flute &amp; Jazz Pian Trio</i> album.

<p>
Finally, let me suggest two pieces from Paul Simon's <i>Rhythm of the 
Saints</i> album: ``The Obvious Child" and ``Proof."

<p>
This should be the good beginning of my responsible participation in 
the community of <i>TAP</i> readers. I won't vouch for its quality as a list 
of good dance tunes, though I am fond of all of these.

<p>

<center>Doug, revref of interior-castle.org</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Well, it certainly gives others a sense of your musical tastes.
I know some people share them.))</i>

<p>
btw, Richard Weiss suggests ``Red, Red Wine" by ``(I think U2)". 
He may be right that U2 recorded this version. 
<i>((Actually, he corrects himself (and I should have caught it too, but I 
was racing to put that part of the szine together.... it was UB40).))</i>
But an earlier recording was made by Neil Diamond. It is worth considering.
<i>((Oh, do I have to??
Neil Diamond really makes me ill.... sorry....
anyway, I've been trying real hard when faced with 6-7 good similar
songs to decide which one REALLY breaks out.  But I'll certainly publish
all your suggestions.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Doug Essinger-Hileman (Fri, 4 Sep 1998 18:41:04 -0400)</b>

<p>
As you said in <i>TAP</i>, the list will eventually be trimmed, then we, the 
readers, will have to vote. 
btw, one last song, a ballad that I think provides some good dancing 
moments: ``An Hour in the Shower" by Chicago.

<p>
Please see attached. The strange thing is that spread betting was
completely unknown in Britain until the 1980s (I think it basically took
off at about the same time as interest grew in American Football), but
these days we seem to have developed it way beyond the States.

<p>
------------------------

<p>
<p>
<center><i>British betting firm gives Clinton 5-9 months</center><br></i>

<p>
<p>LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - A British gambling firm on Friday reported a
flood of bets on how long Bill Clinton will remain U.S. President -
most from punters expecting him to quit within months.
``There has been an enormous amount of trade," said Patrick Jay, head of
the sports operation - which also handles political bets - at IG
Index.

<p>
IG operates on a different basis from ordinary bookmakers. Instead of
offering odds on a particular outcome, it quotes a ``spread".

<p>
Currently the ``spread" on Clinton's term of office, which has already
lasted 20 months, is 25-29 months.

<p>
If Clinton left office this weekend, a punter taking a ``short" position
would be paid five times his or her stake. But if Clinton served out his
full 48-month term, the punter would owe IG 23 (48 less 25) times the
stake.

<p>
Similarly, someone expecting Clinton to survive could bet ``long" and win
19 (48 less 29) times the basic stake if the president served his full
term, but pay nine times if he stood down immediately.

<p>
Jay said he had adjusted the spread on the longevity of the Clinton
presidency down by 10 months during the past week.

<p>
``We have done thousands and thousands of pounds of business in the past
72 hours," he added.

<p>
``About a fifth of it has been from the United States, although that
represents only three to four percent of our client base. Most of the
punters have been going short."

<p>
Conventional British bookmakers are declining for the moment to open a
book on Clinton. ``We feel too remote from the action. If we got the odds
wrong, we could be in for a pasting," said Graham Sharpe, a spokesman
for the William Hill chain.

<p>
Britons are well used to betting on political events and staked millions
of pounds on the outcome of the 1997 general election.

<i>((Thanks, Peter.
I have been saying all year that I believe that eventually he will resign.
I'm not sure under what circumstances, or when, but I don't think he'll
end up staying the course.
Some people were confused by my inclusion of Mark Lew's
subszine.
Whenever it appears it will be here as the last item following the
letters.
I'll try to give it a bigger build up this time!
In so-doing I will also do something that I have been meaning to get around
to for about 150 issues - raising the size of the szine title - just up
to 12 points, wouldn't want to be too flashy.))</i>

<p><br><p><br>
<center></i></b></tt><b><font size="+1">eBENZENE - by Mark Lew</center><br></b></font>

<p>
<p><br>I pay barely any attention to politics these days. 
What a change from the old Benzene days when I could give you an opinion
on any Senate race in the country. I didn't even vote in the election this spring, 
because I had no idea who I preferred. (It was
a primary, but Oakland is so overwhelmingly liberal that the Democratic primary 
may as well be the general election for local posts. 
I think there was another special election later, but I missed that one too.)

<p>
So forgive me if I'm behind the curve on this Monica Lewinsky business. 
As I understand it, Ken Starr's report recently came out. I didn't read that. 
I'm still responding to whenever it was that the president admitted he had some 
sort of sex with Monica and all the Democratic senators had press conferences 
about how ``betrayed" they felt to find out that the president would do
such a thing.

<p>
OK, so what have we learned here?

<p>
1.Pussy has the power to make men do crazy things. 

<p>
 <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
> This is news?? I thought that was a fundamental fact of life.
   
<p>
2.When a married man is having an affair with a woman half his age, he keeps it a secret. 

<p>
 <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
> Well, duh.

<p>
I'm more interested in this whole thing from Ms Lewinsky's point of view. 
What's with all that psycho-babble crap I heard
about what the experience meant to her, and what it tells us about our 
nation and society? All these ultra-sensitive
socio-eggheads are writing articles about what the fellatio-gate scandal 
can teach Americans about sex roles blah blah blah.

<p>
The basic story seems to go: Middle-aged male Bill Clinton was in it for the 
sexual gratification, whereas young female
Monica Lewinsky expected some sort of relationship and was disappointed.

<p>
Oh boy, there's just so many things wrong with that.

<p>
First of all, it assumes that Monica is a total moron. 
True, 21-year-olds do some pretty stupid things, but anyone smart
enough to get in as a White House intern isn't that stupid. 
The guy is a public figure, twice her age, and married - and we're
supposed to believe she thought he was going to be her boyfriend? 
Yeah, right.

<p>
The fact is, she did have ``some sort" of relationship with Clinton; 
she had a short-term, clandestine, oral sex relationship with him. 
It's not the sort of thing that leads to marriage, but it's not 
necessarily unsatisfying, and it's even intimate in a way.
Sometimes people, even women, enjoy a relationship like that, 
and I see no reason to believe Monica couldn't have been one of them.

<p>
That brings us to another thing.... What's the deal with this idea 
that fellatio is about male gratification? It is, of course, but,
unless my women friends are lying to me, a lot of women enjoy 
it quite a bit also.

<p>
Finally, the essential point which no one seems to want to mention, 
is that she got to BLOW THE PRESIDENT!!

<p>
This is why the world had to invent Howard Stern ... because no one 
else in the media would say the obvious: Monica Lewinsky got to give head 
to the president of the United States, fer Chrissake! 
Come on, how many girls get a chance to do something like that? 
Even with all this legal and political bullshit she's going through now, 
that's still something that 10 or 15 years from now makes you look back and 
smile, like, ``Yeah, I did that." Heck, I'd go down on Hillary Clinton 
if I had a chance. I'm not even promiscuous, and I don't 
find Hillary especially attractive, but still ... she's Hillary Clinton. 
You can't pass that up.

<p>The regular Diplomacy opening is filled and begins lurching toward
a gamestart in this issue.
Take that!!.... those of you who claim Postal Diplomacy is dead.
I still think I might actually end up starting a second regular Diplomacy
game.
Anyone interested needs to get their money in now and we'll see
where things shake out for next time.
I think it is likely there will be another regular game started.
I have interest expressed from at least two or three people.
You also can send your $15 for your life of the game sub and
game fee with NMR insurance now.

<p>
Harry Andruschak would like me to run another variant, like ``1499,
Stonehenge, and maybe you could talk to Brad Wilson about him letting
you run a game of Philadelphia Dip.''
The other idea I have that intrigues me much more is to run
Colonia.
I will at least troll for players for Colonia VIIb (I believe that is the most up
to date version).
I have interest from at least three people already.
Could we firm that up in the next few issues, please?
I am still lookinf for ideas on what I will need to know to run Colonia.

<p>
On another front, I'd really like this Black Hole game to start too!
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I STILL am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
We also have the Breaking Away game filled and ready to start.

which is near Highland School, the High School, and the center of

Palmer back when it was an elementary school.  They closed it after my
1st grade.  Amy Wyeth (of the painting Wyeths) was in my kindergarten
class.  I used to swim at Rosemary pool, and I played trumpet at
Carter Elementary, and I used to sled on the hill near the high
school.  I liked going to the library and playing Star Trek on the
computer.  It was easy to reprogram the games, which were all written
in BASIC.

<p>
Hi Goz.  We had a nice game in Chapel Hill, yes?  Too bad you didn't
want to join me in taking out Vince Mous.  But a 3-way was nice (my
France, Warren's Italy and Vince's Russia.)

<p>
Hi Dave.  It's been many years since we've <i>played</i> a game together.
Is this a co-operative game?  From my reading of the rules, it didn't
really seem to be.
<i>((My take on it is that anything (except performance enhancement)
goes.
I'm not going to make any rules about teams working together.
That would seem to divert the potential fun!
I'm glad that it is starting out as a press game in any case!!))</i>

<p>
Hi John, Mark, and John.  Glad to be in a game with y'all.

<p>
(THE STOOGECYCLES): Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

<p>
(TOP TIP FROM THE DESIGNER): Remember this is a game where you go fast by
first going slow.  If you wait to go fast until all my boys have passed
square 118 I'll be much obliged.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
2) I have made a compound error on Ukraine's orders from last time.
I am NOT delaying the game over it, but I want to explain it.
Ukraine had three builds and built a KHA, f SEV, and a KIE; but
I transmogrified the a KIE into an a ODE on the order page AND
on the map. 
Mid-deadline I realized that there should be an a KIE and notified
all relevant players of that fact, but at that time I did NOT
tell them that the a ODE should not be there.
I have corrected all unit placements and orders and I apologize
for the error.
Unlike a certain chief executive of note, I believe in documenting
my senility, stupidity, and other sundry faults when they are 
identified and not trying to deflect and assign blame to others.
Of course, I can make errors in that too sometimes!
But then I can admit those too!!
Damn if it doesn't have me apologizing all too often.
Maybe I should stop and start stonewalling too?
Nah.... why bother.
Anyway, on with the game!!
See the a propos Mekons quote below...

<p>
3) A comment on the art and style of playing games under my season separation
house rules!
You have all just learned what happens when you have a complicated Winter
season and how QUICKLY that Spring season ``springs'' upon you.
The idea is that you don't wait until you get the Spring results before
going on to negotiate seriously about Spring!
If you do, there indeed is not much time to do it.
Lesson for the future....
other times, those ``summer'' seasons just languish a bit when there aren't
many (or none, like this time) retreats.
To my mind it all balances out and it allows me to run more games at once
than I could if I had to line them all up on the same deadlines.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``I tongue Myself beautifully;
I am on a roll, I am always on a roll.
This place was made for Me.
Watch this - I never fuck up.
Hey, I'm so gooood; Me, like always, perfect!
There are 12 words there for thunder;
Speak in tongues, speak in tongues.
Ba ba da gal rath takar ne; Everything is here.
Johnny Cage in Huddersfield; In the pub with modern man.''
From ``Thunder'' off of the latest <i>Me</i>... 

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): <i>TAP</i> #207 with a deadline of 22 August
arrived on 31 August.  
I am sorry your scanner cannot read my letters, 
<i>((It really is old and can't read much of anything any more...))</i>
although (o goody, another excuse for GM abuse!!)
if you weren't so stingy, so much of a tightwad, too busy just being
a Scrooge, perhaps you could buy a new scanner.
<i>((Oh yeah, how'd you like to buy me one??))</i>
Just to show you how generous I can be, in spite of my Scottish
blood, I am willing to donate $1 towards the new scanner.
I encourage other <i>TAP</i> readers to be equally or even more generous.
<i>((Go for a hundred and we might be talking....))</i>
Until then, I'll check the local library tomorrow about internet e-mail
access.

<p>
(GM to PRESS WRITERS): You set each other up SO beautifully here!
I love to see these kinds of press segues.
I have done my best to line it up for maximum effect.
Need I say more??
More!!!

<p>
(EGYPT to FRANCE): As Napoleon told Talleyrand, ``Vous etes de la merde
dans un bas de soie.''

<p>
(SEAN to HARRY): I have no desire to play blind in gunboat the main
reason I got into these games was to get better at my Socialization
skills which is obviously a complete failure and probably when I use up
my money already on standby and in my two CCC games there's a good
chance I will not be remeeting any of you on a battle field unless I
decide to play in a F-T-F PLAY or other.
 
<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): This press item is written in response to an
anguished postcard I received from Sean O'Donnell on 17 August.
I wish to make it clear that Sean NEVER, at any time, threatened me
with a bomb in my kitchen.
I made the whole story up for the sole purpose of perpetuating a ghastly
pun.
I apologize to Sean O'Donnell for any distress this may have caused him,
and promise that I will not, in the future, do it again.

<p>
Also, out of consideration and courtesy for the other 8 players in
this game, if any of you object to my using your name in vain to
perpetuate puns, let me know and I'll refrain.
(This consideration and courtesy does not extend to the GM, of course,
as he doesn't deserve it.)
<i>((And well that it doesn't, as I don't want it!
I love puns.
In fact, I demand that you damn the consideration and courtesy and go
``pun-wild''!))</i>

<p>
(ITALY-WORLD): Sorry for being out of touch for the last few weeks-my
friend and brother were visiting and I've been out in the Great Outdoors
with them while the weather holds.  I will reestablish communications
with you all in about a week and will put more effort into the game
during the coming bleak fall and winter months....

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): Finish me off.

<p>
(ERIC-PAUL, HARRY &amp; JONAS): If you can't beat the O'Donnell's then join
'em!

<p>
(UKRAINE - FRANCE): Thank you for your letter.  Always nice to chat,
even if we have nothing to say.

<p>
(TURKISH SCIENCE FICTION CLUB to MR. ANDRUSCHAK): We are disappointed
that you did not care for our last selection.
We are sending you our latest Best Seller: ``At&#228;turk Meets the Green
Women From Venus''.
(Only two more selections to receive your free bonus!)

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): I doubt if I can help you much on your 
proposed ``party record''.
I never attend parties where pop music is played.
I suppose I could recommend ``Green Christmas'' by Stan Freberg, still
one of my all time favorites.
But I am not sure how to justify this angry satire in a party record.
If you want a party song with some relationship to Diplomacy, I do remember
hearing, on the Doctor Demento Show, a song with the lyrics ``It's 
Istanbul, not Constantinople''.
Hopefully, one of your <i>TAP</i> readers can supply the correct title
and performing outfit.
<i>((The record is called <b>Flood</b>, it is from 1990, the song title
is actually ``Istanbul (not Constantinople)'', and the group is....
They Might Be Giants.
Of course, it has been discussed in these pages before....))</i>

<p>
(SOMEWHERE IN A HALLWAY): Dave looked down at the gun in bewilderment.
This wasn't going as planned.  In all the TV shows you shot someone,
and if he was a bad guy he was knocked across the hall and fell down
dead.  But Rich wasn't dead, and he was shooting back!  Could it be
that Rich was a good guy?  Who wrote this script anyway?  He had a
bad feeling about this, but it didn't look like there was much choice
so he started off following the drops of blood on the floor.  Somehow
he just knew the audience was saying ``No, don't go in there" as he
moved into the next room, gun held high.

<p>
(DOCTOR RICHARD WEISS to ALL MODERN DIPLOMACY PLAYERS): The stabs have
started, so it would help if I knew what your blood types were.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOOB): No, I don't get that way after watching cable. Yes, it's TV
and maybe I would be better off High and smashed what do I need my
reflexes for??

<p>
(RICH GORENSON <i>((sic))</i> to SEAN O'DONNELL): It would seem as if Jonas
Johnson is doing unto you what he has done unto ME in the Colonial 
Diplomacy game.
My advice to you is to take a deep breath, turn around, drop your trousers
and underpants, and bend over.
Also, remember that Harry Andruschak served ten years in the US NAVY, so
he can educate you about the need and use of KY jelly.
I'm sure he has had much experience to draw on.

<p>
(THE CASTRATED GREEK NATIVES to AMBASSADOR ANDRUSCHAK): We blame you!
It was you who gave those inhuman Turks the Unholy idea to take away
our manhood!
We curse you.
``May the tires of your Postal Trucks blow out all at once!''
``May you be flooded with so much junk mail at Christmas Time that
you are blinded and cannot read the fine print!''
We know you are to visit Turkey.
We will wait and watch for you...

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): I thank you for your letters of 18 and 31 August.
Perhaps I did err in over-estimating Spain's diplomatic and tactical
skills.
However, I had suspicions in Winter 1994 that Sean O'Donnell was a hoax.
Could a 17 year old really be so lacking in language skills?
And even if he did lack language skills and diplomatic skills, he
could still have tactical skills.
Many a player has been a poor diplomat but a hot-shot at tactics.
That is why no-press gunboat was and still is so popular in some
szines. (NOT, of course, in <i>TAP</i>.)
<i>((SLAM, BOOM, DUNK!!!))</i>

<p>
(BERLIN to GDANSK): We have devoted our two fleets to the prevention 
of the growth of the Russian Fleet North.  That was to prevent his
eventual access to areas adjacent to our vital lifelines-Ber, Den, Kie
and Hel.  And now YOU build another Baltic fleet, at the cost of your
taking Bie and at the price of defending your home centers.  Are you 
ready to pay those prices?

<p>
(POLAND to WORLD): Those who do not remember the past are doomed to
repeat it.
60 years ago, Northwestern University awarded an honorary college degree
to ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy.

<p>
(PIRATE CAPTAIN ANDRUSCHAK-TITANIC TEENYBOPPERS): The boat sank, get over it.

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE OF 1 440 774 2928):  Oberlin OH and don't know a dang word 
in Latin. It wasn't me that wrote that the only two foreign languages I 
could write is German and French and I don't know the pronounceachings 
of French due to all I got is a book to use.

<p>
(FRANCE-TURKEY): Thank you for your letter received 28 August.
I did write all nine powers after receiving <i>TAP</i> #206, so
where are my letters in return from Britain, Egypt, Italy, Poland,
Russia, and Ukraine?
For the record, I am NOT attacking Spain.
What looks like an attack on Spain is really a very clever deception
engineered by Sean O'Donnell to confuse and eventually eliminate Britain.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR AT&#196;TURK P&#214;-LLARD to THE NATIONS OF ITALY AND THE UKRAINE):
I do hope you gentlemen have received my recent letters.
Negotiations are open.
Let us proceed and avoid unpleasant difficulties....

<p>
(P-F): When some keeps repeating in bigger and bigger ways that something 
is not even being considered and does this once too many 
times I get suspicious.  So I'll bite.  When do we do it?

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): We wish to protest your Army in Austria learning to yodel.
You know very well that the Geneva Conventions ban Deadly Yodeling warfare
just as they ban Deadly Joke warfare.
Rest assured we will not allow a Yodeling Gap to exist.
We are now in the process of teaching our army in Switzerland to yodel also,
and we have the best teachers in the world.
So there!

<p>
(P-G): I didn't mean to do any harm with the fleet build.

<p>
(CHARLES JONES <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> HARRY ANDRUSCHAK): Build Fleet Brest?!
What kind of dumb missteak (sic) is that?
Are you one of those who tried to learn DIPLOMACY in Richard Weiss's
zine <i>Zero Sum</i>?
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

<p>
(POLAND to UKRAINE): When are you going to get moving?

<p>
(UKRAINE to TURKEY): ``May those who love us, love us.
And those that don't love us, may God turn their hearts.
And if He doesn't turn their hearts, may He turn their ankles so
we'll know them by their limping.''

<p>
(P-R): ... and maybe even myself ``Non semper erit sestas"

<p>
(ALLEGED ALBERT EINSTEIN QUOTE): ``Everything should be made as 
simple as possible, but not one bit simpler.''

<p>
(P-LOWER BOARD): What's with all the land forces

<p>
(ITALY to EGYPT): Remember what we spoke about.
Out of sight, out of mind.

<p>
(UKR to ITALY): I agree to disagree, but that should be next.

<p>
(SPAIN <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): Si, Andruschak, populi arbitrio tua cana senectus
spurcata impuris moribus intereat, non equidem dubito quin primum
inimica bonorum lingua execta avido sit data vulturio,
effossos oculos voret atro gutture corvus, intestina canes, cetera
membra lupi.

<p>
(SPAIN to WHOEVER THIS LATIN SPANIARD IS): I don't know latin people and 
what I do know I learned from braveheart and I have no clue how to spell 
liar and Barbarious. 

<p>
(TRANSLATION): If, Andruschak, your decrepit old age, polluted by your
wicked ways, should be cut short by the will of the people, I have no
doubt that it will be your tongue, the enemy of all good men, which
will be cut out first, and thrown to greedy vultures; the raven will
suck your gouged-out eyes down its dark black throat, the dogs will
guzzle your guts, the wolves will get the leftovers!

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): Hurry up and finish me off.
I'm tired of you trying to destroy me.
Keep it up, I don't care.

<p>
(GERMANY to FRANCE): I hope you finish Spain off soon.
His babbling is driving us all over the edge.

<p>
(STING EMPIRE): Sean stood before sweating from the lose of blood. 
Above him looming stood Jonas and Harry. 
Harry shot Sean in the head then Jonas shot Harry 
in the chest then punched him to death. Before Sean died he yelled, ``I 
wanted to be Lambert!" then died. Harry died staring at Jonas laughing.
        
<p>
Rich ran down the corridor where he saw a bazooka mounted on the 
wall, pulled the trigger, and it exploded as Dave, Kent, and Roland shot 
then Kent shot Roland who shot Dave. They all died, leaving Paul, Jeff, 
Eric, and Jonas. 

<p>
See you next issue of <i>Sting Empire</i>. May contain violent content may 
not be suitable to ages of 20-40 with bald heads. 

<p>
(PALACE OF VERSAILLES): The cabinet meeting had been long and busy.
With war breaking out all over Europe, the question of survival
hanged in the air.
Towards the end, one of the ministers asked about the USA.
What were they going to do about all this?
Prime Minister Andruschak smirked and said ``Special Operations?"

<p>
A man cloaked in black, with daggers in his belt, stood up.
No hint of emotion could be seen through the black mask.
``Our plan to sabotage all the USA computers worked.
The Pentagon is helpless, although they have allowed no word of this to
leak out.
It will take them about 3 years to undo the mess caused by Windows 95.''

<p>
The Minister of State shook his head in disbelief.
``How in the world did you manage to get such control over Bill Gates?''
The pictures were passed around the table.
Typical comments were ``I didn't know you could DO that with gerbils
and duct tape'' and ``what a creative use of cheese spread!''
The meeting ended on an upbeat mood.

Attack you unprovoked?
I think not.
As I remember, you told me that you were not going to bounce me out of

Ah, but a little birdie (we'll call that birdie China) told me of your
diabolical plan to in fact bounce me in Fus and I made you pay.
<i>((Don can always be counted upon to blow his own brilliant plans

``It is limitless," stated the duck, ``Until you run out!"
        
<p>
``What?  You mean the easy dots are not infinite?  How shall we
survive????"
        
<p>
``The old fashioned way!  Oh, could you pick that soap up?"

<p>
(BORNEO): 
(At the Dutch HQ in Borneo, Chef and the Kids are trying to figure out
what to do.  They wanted to enter a bike race, but Pip crashed one of
the bikes.  While Pip let all the kids spit on him, they still don't
have enough bikes for the race.)
 
<p>
Chef: Well, children, what should we do?

<p>
Stan: Let's kick Pip's ass!

<p>
Kyle: Yeah, Pip is really annoying.

<p>
Kenny: Mm-mm-mmm

<p>
Chef: Now, Kenny, you know that's not a nice thing to say.
(pause)

<p>
All the kids: (much laughter)
 
<p>
Cartman: Yeah, that Frog Pip just won't shut up!
 
<p>
At that moment Pip walks in.
 
<p>
Cartman: There's that French bastard now!

<p>
Stan:  Hey, Pip, why don't you go back to France where you belong?
 
<p>
Pip: (starting to get mad) I've told you before, I'm British, not
French!
 
<p>
Kyle: Yeah, sure, Frenchie, we've heard it before.

<p>
Cartman: Stupid Frog.
 
<p>
Pip:  I'M NOT FRENCH!  ARGH!
 
<p>
(Pip flies into a rage, tearing the room to shreds.  Kenny dies.
Stan starts drawing something in the sand floor.)
 
<p>
Kyle: Dude, what are you doing?

<p>
Stan: That kid Damien said if we ever needed his Dad's help, we should
draw one of these on the floor and start playing Philip Glass music.

<p>
Kyle: Cool!
 
<p>
(Stan finishes the pentagram.  A puff of smoke, and in comes Satan,
yup, Beelzebub, Prince of Darkness himself).
 
<p>
Satan: (Booming voice): Who dares call me to the mortal realm?
 
<p>
Stan:  Oh, Satan?  That would be me?  Could you do something about
this Pip guy?
 
<p>
(Pip flies into a rage and attacks Chef, who holds him back by firmly
placing his hand on Pip's forehead.)
 
<p>
Satan: (softer) Pph, is that all.  BEGONE PIP!
 
<p>
(Pip is lifted into the air by dozens of screaming demons, and borne
out of the room.  He is last seen headed towards the Himalayas.)
 
<p>
Stan, Kyle, and Cartman: Hooray!
 
<p>
Satan:  Anything else I can do for you boys?
 
<p>
Kyle: Yeah, we heard about this bike race, and we wanted to enter a
team, but one of our bikes was ruined by Pip.
 
<p>
Satan:  Oh, is that all?
(Satan waves his hands, and four shiny new hellcycles appear.)
 
<p>
Cartman: Sweet!

<p>
Stan: Kick-Ass!

<p>
Kyle:  Oh, thank you Satan!  One more thing, our fourth teammate,
Kenny, just died.  Do you think you could release his soul for this
race?
 
<p>
Satan:  Sure!  (He snaps his fingers a *puff* Kenny arrives,
healthy as ever.)
 
<p>
Stan: Hi, Kenny!

<p>
Kenny:  Mm Mmmm.
 
<p>
Satan:  Here, have some Andro to help your ride along.
(Satan dispenses some pills to all the kids).
<i>((Hey, do you want to be disqualified before the race starts????
Do you think just by hiding this press in another game that the ever-vigilant
race-director won't be right on top of these things??
Swallow those pills and you can join Pip on his ``little trip''.))</i>
 
<p>
Cartman:  You're the best, Satan!

<p>
Kyle:  Yeah, Satan kicks ass!

<p>
Stan: Oh, Satan, what can we do for you.
 
<p>
Satan: Well, I'm glad you asked.  In about two years time, my
earthborne armies will need your help...

<center>GERMANY (eliminated)</center><br>

<p>
Congratulations, Keith.
This is only the second game of my postal career in which
I've been eliminated (and at least I lasted until the final
move!).  Golly, things were going along just fine until that
fateful turn when I made two mistakes:  (1) I decided to stab
Austria.  (2) I turned my back on Russia in doing so.  Oops.
Vae victis, as Brennus said to the Romans.
Now, as for this officious Monday-morning quarterbacking by
the GM, telling us how we could have more effectively
prolonged the game for (unh!) one (oof!) more (urgh!) year . . .
<i>((But you coulda, woulda, and shoulda!!!))</i>

<p>
<p><br>
<center>FRANCE (survived)</center><br>

<p>
Gentlemen, this is my first end-game statement, so I'll try not to 
sound like a fool.
<i>((Don't worry, our dear President has lowered the standards
of discourse so far that it will be difficult to look truly foolish....))</i>
First off, I have to congratulate Keith on not only his excellent 
military strategy, but his superb diplomatic tactics too.
I found it very impressive (and disheartening at the time) that Keith
managed to convince Steve to stab me, while at the same time, moving
in on Steve from behind.
I also have to commend Keith on keeping Randy thinking that he was
not going to stab him.
As hard as I tried to get Randy to realize that Keith was going
after him, Randy did not believe me and as a result, Keith had another
successful stab.

<p>
Speaking of backstabbing, I don't believe that I have ever found so many
knives in my back in one game.
<i>((Be glad that you aren't playing in the Arsenic and Old Farts game.
We've had way more stabs in two game years than this game had all the
way through.))</i>
It really surprised me that I was able to pull all of the knives out and live.
This is definitely one of the odder games that I have played in.
I have never seen as many stabs in one game before and I have never seen
an English fleet alone in the Mediterranean before.
But then again, I have been playing Diplomacy for less than four years.

<p>
Nevertheless, this was a quality game.
While I hate losing (I never lose any FTF games with my friends) I enjoyed
playing The Hermit.
In my opinion, which has little experience behind it, PBM games are a lot
harder than FTF games.
Maybe I'm encountering higher quality players in PBM.
<i>((In general, most FTF games don't have enough good players in a small
group, whereas most PBM players are pretty good.
But, with good players, a FTF game in my view is MUCH harder to play.
In a postal game, you can think out what you're doing and why you're doing it.
In an FTF game, a complex game pretty quickly gets out of control.))</i>
All in all, this was a quality game and I thank everyone who played with me
for making my PBM debut an enjoyable one (I also have to thank Mike Barno
and Jim for my vocab lessons!).

<p>
The Ambassador of France, Luke Dwyer

<p>
<p><br>
<center>Austria-Hungary (survived)</center><br>

<p>
For me this game started ominously in that I took over the Austrian position
as a standby in Spring 1901.
<i>((Note that I decided to count the Spring 1901 new players (you actually
took over BEFORE any moves were made) as original players.))</i>
I feared that Russia and Turkey had already made plans to divide and conquer.
My fears were unfounded.
I wrote to the Turk twice and never got a response.
Keith, I believe, did not have much better results.
Keith, a player whose name I've seen over the years, was a regular letter
writer and a shrewd diplomat.
The Russian/Austrian alliance was forged.

<p>
I was also on good terms with the Italian player: Mark Kinney.
Mark's Italy being friendly meant a quick demise for Turkey.
While Turkey was being cleanly and efficiently eliminated, the west
remained in chaos.
At first, it appeared that the two `rookies' (Pollard and Dwyer) were allies.
Steve Emmert, however, was successful in getting France to turn on England
and with a bit of Russian treachery, the second wicked witch was brought
to her knees.
Feeling sympathy for my friend, Kent, getting so brutally pounded in his
first postal Diplomacy game, I supported him into Tunis a little later.
That, in retrospect, might have been a big mistake...

<p>
There came a point in the game when essentially I had a choice: stab Italy
(and remain Russia's ally) or vice versa.
It is interesting to speculate - I think - on how this game would have
turned out had I chosen to stick with Mark Kinney.

<p>
The rest, basically, is obvious.
Keith stabbed me one year before I expected it.
Luke Dwyer's France was slow to meet the Russian threat.
I gradually lost interest in the game (reminiscent of my last Dip burnout
period in the late '80's) culminating in a critical NMR.
I think `the allies' could have stopped Russia if we had communicated
better and coordinated more effectively.
Given the reality of the situation, however, I think that my NMR
simply gave Mr. Sherwood his victory a game year earlier than he 
would have had it otherwise.

<p>
I'd like to congratulate Keith Sherwood on his victory and thank Jim for 
running the game.
As for myself, I expect to retire from the hobby for a while.
I'll be back when the fire is back: when I'm ready to play the way I'm
capable of playing.
Primarily due to apathy and indifference, I think that I played more
poorly in `The Hermit' than in any of my other 15 or so postal Diplomacy
games.

<p>
Until next time, Randy 

<p>
PS Did I win the most COA's in a single game contest??
<i>((I wanted to count them, but it was just too difficult, you had at
least a dozen....))</i>

<p>
<p><br>
<center>England (survived)</center><br>

<p>
Now it has ended.... Wow!
Contrary to what many thought, I survived.
Going back to the beginning of the game and throughout it, I learned a lot!
(This was my first Diplomacy game, ever)
I still defend my tactics.
My problem was not keeping confidential my plans to my allies.
Initially, Russia and France were Britain's ``friends''.
I had two immediate goals which ironically came to be, but 
in a different path I never expected.
France made a proposal to attack Italy, full force.
I decided to throw in one of my fleets, mainly to pull his
nearby French fleet away and thereby demilitarize the sea.
The main attack for Britain was to be aimed at Germany.
I had convinced myself that Russia and Austria would join in.
Well, plans went astray.
I still am not sure why Dwyer pulled out of this pre-set plan.
If any of you look back at Italy earlier in the way, you will
notice that his forces were strung out Eastwardly towards Turkey.
When Admiral Langworthy came into position and the event was
to begin, Luke started giving excuses why he could not begin an
invasion.
Big warning bells sounded off!
At this point I knew he would not honor our agreement.
I decided to realign (too late) with Germany and attack France!
I let Russia and Germany know my intentions (Bad mistake, but
I'm a rookie).
<i>((Hey, it's OK, Don Williams makes the same type of mistakes
and he's a veteran....))</i>
Next thing I know, France counters my moves perfectly and from there
on, Britain declines....

<p>
I have experienced joy, anger, amazement, frustration, and even 
contentment with this game.
Going into it, Randy prepped me.
On one side I knew players lied like sheets.
On the other side some people play with a sense of honor.
I saw both in the Hermit.
The reason I survived was two fold.
One was because I happened to be in position in the Med. Sea.
The second amazed me.
Randy out of nowhere offered to support me into Rome or Tunisia.
Incredible!
I was under the impression that he was a backstabbing son of a....
What a total opposite.
He was the only one in the game that played with a bit of chivalry
(you see, my problem is that I play lots of games where you must
work together in some kind of common goal).
So, I was na&#239;ve.
But, you old pros, that doesn't mean I shall not stab at thee in the
future.
I am hooked on Diplomacy.
I think you all need fresh blood in order to invigorate this game.
Different styles.
That is what I shall attempt.
I will try to make it fun and break some of you of your old bad habits...
<i>((Good luck..... you'll need it!))</i>

<p>
Now, I congratulate you, you old wolf, Keith Sherwood.
You did it all by yourself.
I look forward to a rematch.
Mr. Emmert, good game!
Sorry the Huns didn't make it.
If I had aligned with you, events would have turned out differently.
Dwyer, please don't force the British people to speak French
(you bloody...).
Admiral Erik Von Steuben, thank you old boy.
We do retain Africa.
To Ambassador Kinney, I was serious when I suggested supporting you into Spain.
You could have trusted me.
Mr. Sasseville, you never wrote.
What can I say?
Jim-Bob Burgess, thank you for running a splendid game.
I shall play Diplomacy until I become gray, senile, and ancient.
This game will not die unless we allow it....

<p>
I look forward to meeting more Pros, more Rookies, and having more fun....

<p>
Take care all.... Kent.

<p>
PS Does Mike Barno get an end game statement?
(Hey, hee, hee)
<i>((If he wants one, sure, absolutely!
Anyone can write press or make end game statements in any of my games.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
<p>
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is STILL
missing... someone find him!).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) I forgot to put Paul Rauterberg's two builds on the map
and in the ``has'' section of the results last issue.
There should not be any serious concern about this, I hope?
But, yes, your GM blew that one again.
Twice with more or less the same mistake in one issue.
Gotta get on that one!

<p>
3) Back here in this one, we had the inevitable FET (almost DIAS)
draw proposal.
It 'tis rejected.
It also is reproposed.
Please vote on it again with your summer press!

(TUR-FRA): Tired of being outplayed by you, I submit these rather risky Spring
orders in a desperate attempt to have at least one season where I thwart you.
Probably blow up in my face.

(PARIS to GERMANY (WHEREVER YOU DWELL)):  Consider yourself
punished for coordinating that early alliance against me....

This is FASCINATING reading.
I've heard some comments that this IS fascinating reading.
I apologize for some of the formatting difficulties in the way the

Would anyone like to make comments for print?
If I don't get around to this shortly, I might drop it.....
you guys know that I just leave these notes in here as a ``shopping

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) All draws and concessions are still rejected.
With winter orders please vote on a concession to Germany, and FG, FGT, GT, and
FGTA draw proposals.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FRA-GM): Hey, I was just trying to give you a bad time and inject a little
levity into the game?
You're too serious.
Lighten up!
<i>((I think that's the first time I've ever been accused of THAT!
I'm lighter than air....))</i>

<p>
(TUR-FRA): Well, well, well.  I trust that you are not a Christian zealot
waiting for the Inquisition to come back, because that would be the end of
your foul-mouthed friend the Germ.  However, if you have a moral fiber, you
will be able to tell from re-reading Summer Press who is voting against the
4-way.  If you want to play this out, continue to suck up to the Germ.  I
hope you don't get sick.  Do remember that if you suck up to the Boob, you
will get sick, very sick, touched in the head, lactose intolerance for ever
for sucking Boob lacrimations and may never be able to write without
tangents again.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): I have voted for F/G, F/G/T and of course they don't pass.
I can't bring myself to vote for Austria.
He stabbed me.
Turkey told me in one of his last letters that he wasn't voting for the draws,
then a turn or two later he put it in his press.
It's my belief that he keeps Austria alive so that he can make us believe that
Austria is voting against the draws.
Let's revisit the issue of Jim-Bob not tallying the votes correctly.
You are assuming that Jim can count up to four.
How's that for abuse, Jim?
<i>((I don't need to count to four, I only have to count to one, the number
of people that either don't vote or vote against each of the draws.
Be assured, none of them has ever passed.))</i>

<p>
(FRA-GER): Give Turkey a break.
He can't helpit if he is an ass...
or that he likes them!
(Well, maybe he could if he would exercise a little self-control, but 
those people in San Francisco don't seem to have that as one of their
outstanding character traits.)

<p>
(TUR-GERM): Maybe you have lost your cell membranes and have become your own
cytokines, the dreaded needs a host ``VIRUS!"  How's your RNA?  Your
reverse transcriptase?  You think Boob, who is still trying to pull off his
Brother bit, could invent Mr. Michael J Blarno, Esq, JR???  Have you ever seen
the Boob?  You ever heard anyone say anything good about him?  Even his wife
compares rock performers to dead poets.  Neither of them have a clue.  Go
rehearse for your retirement, because while you were in Chicago, I was in
Detroit (and that's a damn fine song.  Which makes me ask the neuron that
still functions for Boob, Lucinda Williams makes me think of Graham
Parker if he were still alive, or at least Emilooo if she were singing his
vocals.
What do you think of those three?)
<i>((Graham Parker is still very much alive, isn't he???))</i>

<p>
(FRA-GM): Yes, I'm finally having fun.
Seeing that my deliberate policy of giving my supply centers to Germany
is driving Turkey crazy, I'm having more fun with the game than I've
had in a long, long time.
I still wish it would end.

<p>
(TUR-AUS): C'est la vie as the Frenchman tries to say.  C'est l'morte as
you and I will be saying before too long.  See you in a couple of weeks at
the house of the winner of more Dip awards for BEST ZINE than any other
mortal. (And don't worry about the 
VIRUS and little Napoleon coming, they couldn't figure out a clue like
that if they asked Peeriblah.)

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MR. LOW HOF): I'd go for the draw and kill Austria, if I
was you!
I'm going to bet that you don't.

<p>
(TUR-VIRUS): I'm catching a little head cold, and occassionally I go ``Hof,
hof, hof."  Other than that, Hof Haut is a fairly large company out here.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): I still am of the opinion that you made up Mike B.
By the way I don't believe in the twin brothers Don and Dan Stafford that 
you made up either.
Isn't it kind of lame making up twin brothers with first names that start with
the same letter, who also play Diplomacy?
In several issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> you talk about Don and 
and others it's Dan.
<i>((Nope, it's only been YOU!))</i>
I distinctly remember that in issues 37, 54, and 121, you talked about a
Don Stafford.
Do I get points for abusing the GM yet?
<i>((A very miniscule number of points, for some pretty lame abuse!
I of course checked said issues and found no such reference.
making it even worse for you, there WAS NO <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>
for 37 and 54.... hah, hah, hah!))</i>
These points are very hard to earn.
Richard is so much funner to abuse.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): I had been considering sending my moves to
666 instead of 664 as a good way to start GM abuse, but often wondered
how often you checked the second box.
I'm really not very good at abusing you, you are a good GM and I like
your comments.
<i>((You clearly don't know me very well....))</i>

1) Remember that the default with leftover NMR insurance is to put it into
a continuing sub until it is gone.
You also can use it toward a new game, e.g. if Michael wants to join a new

Congratulations, Drew.
This game had a couple of turning points from my
perspective.  The first was when I invaded Russia, which was
(I think) right after John took it over.  I convoyed an army into
Livonia in a spring turn, and he had an army in Warsaw,
nothing in Moscow, and nobody close enough to help.  It
became a guessing game as to where to go, and I got lucky
and guessed right; my army walked into Warsaw as he
covered Moscow.  The inevitability of his downfall after that
cemented one conclusion I had drawn years ago:  An
opponent's home dots are far more valuable than his ``fringe
acquisitions," for obvious reasons.  If I had just taken, say,
Sweden, he could have fought me off.
The second turning point for me was, of course, Drew's stab
of me.  It goes without saying that it succeeded, and was
decisive for this game.  He and I had communicated often
and coordinated our moves very well until that point.
Drew told me that he would have been disappointed to learn
that I had never considered stabbing him, but that is, in fact,
the case.  We had worked together so well for the entire
game that I never even thought of stabbing him; this sets me
up as one of the game's great suckers, I suppose.
Jim, thank you for taking this game over from Garret.
Shamefully, you never gave me credit for the $15 I sent you,
but given the length of the game, I'd have to say I got my
money's worth.
By the way, did anyone ever hear from Dan?  He never wrote
to me the entire game.
Thanks, guys, for a fun game.

Let me use a work by Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) called: `Success is counted
sweetest'.
This is an apt statement since I was knocked out of the game so quickly
(where are friends when you need them?):

<p>
``Success is counted sweetest; By those who ne're succeed;

<p>
To comprehend a nectar; Requires sorest need.

<p>
Not one of all the purple host; Who took the flag today;

<p>
Can tell the definition; So clear, of victory.

<p>
As he, defeated, dying; On whose forbidden ear;

<p>
The distant strains of triumph; Break, agonized and clear.''

<center>Suffren - France - End of Game Statement (won)</center><br>

<p>
I really enjoyed this game.  The truth be known this is the first game I
have won outright since I started playing by mail about five or six years
ago.  It took most of those five or six years to complete Suffren.

<p>
From the very beginning it was my plan to form a three way western
alliance.  Despite the comments throughout the life of this game, I
thought it would be more interesting than the standard ``fight it out in
the west and fight it out in the east" type of games.  I spent lots of
money on postage due to the high turnover at the beginning of the game.  I
ended up negotiating with two Englands and three Germanys.  I threw
everything I had against Italy, trusting in my allies who didn't let me
down.  Steve Emmert's move into Tyrollia early on was the key move of the
game.  That really shook things up and cemented our alliance for good (or
almost for good).

<p>
Italy had no chance at that point and Steve and I kept in perfect
coordination.  The eastern powers never seemed to really confront the
threat from the west.  Russia devoured Turkey, but lost everything else.
Austria seemed paralyzed.  I figured that Austria was allied with Russia
against Turkey and Italy so he didn't want to help Italy, but never got
any of the spoils in Turkey.  The bottom line was that the east couldn't
or wouldn't confront our threat from the west in a coordinated fashion.

<p>
After the fall of Italy, Steve and I moved on Russia in Turkey.
Unfortunately, some botched email communications between Steve and Jim
resulted in Steve losing his army in Asia Minor and allowing Russia to
survive the game.

<p>
As with all three-ways, we had to confront the problem of having no place
left for one of the powers (England in our case) to grow.  Given how close
the alliance between Steve and I had become due to our need for very close
coordination in Italy, England became the odd man out.  We agree to stab
and then split the win between us.  I had every intention at that point in
the game in accepting a two way draw.

<p>
I had a good time for awhile proposing three-way (and then 2-way) draws
and voting against them or sending in an NVR.  I'm glad that the GM
doesn't allow public draw votes.

<p>
A couple of things then changed.  It became clear to me that I was in a
much stronger position than Steve and had the chance for a solo;  Steve
had become too trusting; and I no longer needed Steve in the Balkans.  It
pained me to stab Steve as I had never had a closer ally before, but I
felt that not going for the win would be a cop out and I also felt it
would breath more life into the game.  The flurry of email from Steve
putting me in touch with others who had stabbed him in the past (seems
like a long list), made the stab worthwhile fun in itself.

<p>
I miscounted supply centers at the very end, so I was surprised to win
when I did.  I was expecting a race to the Balkans to determine the
outcome.  I was surprised to find the survivors turning on each other at
the end, but it didn't matter at all.

<p>
All and all I had a great time with this game.  I wish we could find
Garret, though.  Thanks for the outstanding GM work of restarting and
following through on this game.

<center>Turkey II (Eliminated)</center><br>

<p>
Coming in as a standby with only 1 SC didn't leave much room for diplomacy
or maneuvering.
John Schultz (Russia) was the only player to write back to me with any ideas,
mostly to try and break up the Evil Western Triple Alliance.

<p>
I did write to E/F/G, pointing out that they were in a position to run
the inspiring convoy of an army from Saint Petersburg to Smyrna.
I still wish they had gone for it, if only to see the GM's reaction.
Of course, to set up the convoy route would have required France to
back off his fleets from Greece and leave my lone army untouched.
Instead, France promptly eliminated me.
That's the problem with kids nowadays, no sense of humor.

<p>
But eventually the Evil Triple did fall apart, and I do look forward to
reading the endgame statements of the three players involved.
Most importantly, when France and Germany built, and England didn't,
was that a planned double-cross by France AND Germany, or were France
and Germany acting independently?

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-``LAWYER''): Yes, it would be nice to have an ORIGINAL
lawyer joke, but what you re-printed in <i>TAP</i> #206 was not all that
original.
I remember hearing it back in the 1950's when I was at Sladegreen County
Secondary School in England.
Only back then the 3 persons were an Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman.
Since the stereotype of a Scotsman was of a greedy moneygrubber, guess
who tossed in the check?
In 1958, at age 14, I was back in the USA.
This joke was being recycled with a Protestant, a Catholic, and a Jew
as the three persons involved.
Since the stereotype of a Jew was of a greedy moneygrubber, guess who tossed
in the check?
In fact, I have grave doubts that ANY of the so-called lawyer jokes are original.
They seem to be the same old ethnic bashing jokes re-written.  ***yawn***
<i>((You must have a good memory, I can never remember jokes so when I 
hear them again, I still laugh....
I can remember other things really well though.))</i>
