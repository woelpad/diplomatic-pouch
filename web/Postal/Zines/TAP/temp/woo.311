Jim,

Let me put in conditional orders so I don't (and you
don't on my behalf) have to worry about what Brendan
does:

If Brendan adds the 2 to one of his cards, then my
orders are:

Agnus 2
Sanctus 13
Kyrie 3
Gloria 1

(as before I think)

and if Brendan makes a 4th card which is a 2:

Agnus 1
Sanctus 13
Kyrie 3
Gloria 1

Thanks.  Oh - do I owe you any money?

-Alex
