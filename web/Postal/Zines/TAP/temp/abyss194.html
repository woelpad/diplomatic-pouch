store,

<p>
You're gonna give 'em all your money, radio plays what they want you

<p><br><p><br>Happy birthday, Don Williams!!
The date on the masthead, and the date as I type this, is the Duckmeister's
big four-oh birthday.
He's just SOOOO old, much older than me and those of us safely in our
thirties!!
Thank you, Don, having such luminous pathbreakers makes it much easier
for the rest of us to see where we're going.

<p>
A hale and hearty WELCOME BACK, to Peter Sullivan, who returns with
that subszine name which shall not be named, since every time I do
I start humming some silly song about being in the shade under the sea.
Damned if I know why.
Still, Peter is very welcome.
Note that he also has a game opening!
Please sign up if you like those sorts of games.
Players in Peter's szine receive this szine by mail free as a perk.

<p>
And that's not all!! I finally have the pack together for our Colonial
Dip game!!
The house rules are published in this issue for your perusal as a 
result.
Those of you who don't pay attention to such things might want to
take a gander.
I twisted an arm and we have added Rich Goranson to round out our
seven player group.
And he didn't get France!
Not only that, but Andy York is on board to join Mike Barno as a
standby!!
See below, and Miller Number, please, Mr.&nbsp;Kendter!!!

<p>
The real news, which I've so deftly tried to distract you from, is that
I am late again.  I've pushed the deadlines back to compensate.
I want to grossly and publicly apologize for the megascrewup with
the deadline this time.
On top of being late, the UPS strike put the USPS WAY behind on 
the mail.  For some of you on the West Coast it took about ten
days for the szine to get to you!!!
Anyway,
I wanted to get issue #194 in the post and go to Brad Wilson's
Vertigo Games, because otherwise there would have had to have been
a three week delay if I went while delaying the #194 deadline.
Although many of you told me I should be at Vertigo Games, I am
not.  I shall call in tomorrow or Sunday to be chastised.
Instead, the szine will be a week late anyway....
I guess everybody loses.
The big thing for me is staying on schedule to a big blowout
January, 1998 grand two-hundreth issue!!!
We're gonna do it.  Plan to send me your music stuff now.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada. 
You can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
The current game opening for Colonial Diplomacy will start
as soon as I get money from seven players since Nekayah has now ended.
For more on this, see below.
Also note that more results for the demo game 
are included.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
Note that everything has been moved to the diplom.org site.
See David's letter below.
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the devel.diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to the present are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the 
pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP directory in compressed postscript format.
The gracious assistance of Kevin Roust is most appreciated
in keeping up this site.
The files begin ap131.ps.Z and go sequentially from there.
Since it's UNIX based, all of those upper and lower cases are important.
If anyone wants help from me on doing this, they only have to ask and I
can help you determine if you have access to FTP which stands for
File Transfer Protocol and can handle postscript files.
The Caltech site is at:

<p>
ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/WWW/

<p>
or check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch 
at its brand new address with all of
the information you would need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
 
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch

<p>
In addition, through Jamie McQuinn's portion of the Pouch, or directly
through:

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP/

<p>
you can access the mirror site to Caltech and get to the szine that way.

<p>
In a relatively NEW development, the szine also is available as a PDF file,
readable with Adobe Acrobat's free reader.
If you already have Adobe's reader on your computer, you can E-Mail me for
a copy.
I started the test last issue and am continuing to have some
technical difficulties with it, so I'm still in test mode.
Basically, the file is printing fine, but it is hard to read on the
screen.  I am working with the experts at Adobe to try to solve
this problem.
If it makes you feel any better, we are having the same problem on
the professional Adobe electronic journal that I co-edit and solving
that problem has ``real'' implications, so be sure that I am trying
to do so.
Any of you who have NOT E-Mailed me about this test can still do so.
After I test this for a bit, I will have TWO E-Mail subscription lists
so you can choose PDF file, TeX source file, or both at your leisure. 

<p>
NOTE: PDF testers will have to wait for this issue until around 
September 10th or 11th, as I will not be back in my office until
then and I have to produce the PDF there.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR JERRY LUCAS</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Last chance to find Jerry Lucas!
If you don't find him by September 20th, he's only ``worth''
twenty-five bucks.
I know he has a common name, but someone out there should be
enterprising enough to track him down.
See the ``Mark Stretch lament'' in the letter column for more.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Mike Mills or Garret Schenck
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.
The next person will be announced in Issue #195 and will be an extra
special person to lead up to my 200th issue.
Watch for it.
Heh, heh, heh, here's a riddling hint for those who might want to get
started early on this one, since I have ``reason'' to believe
he WILL be found.
Mausoleum for a mouse, who found the mouse??
It's all just such a bother..... no, that's not quite the right word,
it's just such a tedious bother, but he does have a VERY specific
connection to the genesis of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.      
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

Australian dollars or continental European 
currencies respectively.
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<center><b>DIPDOM NEWS SECTION (with letters)</center><br></b>

<p>
<p> 
Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Terry Tallman (Fri, 15 Aug 1997 11:34:59 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<p>
Chris Carrier was mentioned as having passed away.  I think it was
here last issue, maybe somewhere else.  I also recalled that John Boardman
was the one who announced it.  I can only assume that Carrier was playing
in <i>Graustark.</i>

<p>
I met Carrier in the early 80's at my second Daf con.  I had come
across him in Tribe's of Crane, a commercial role playing game.  I met
Eric Ozog there too and he dragged me into postal dip.

<p>
Carrier was a power gamer groupy.  He was attracted to players and
gm's with big egos and big phone bills.  I suspect a part of this was
because his own life was dysfunctional in the extreme and the fantasy
worlds of power role playing games and the mega dip aspects of postal
diplomacy gave him the opportunity to do what so many postal and e-mail
gamers do.  

<p>
They become who they would LIKE to be.  No one can see them so
there are no preconceptions.  You are whoever you choose to portray.  
I have referred to postal gaming in the past as a super hero suit that
a lot of players use to have a ``real life" or at least one with a little
excitement or interaction with people.

<p>
Chris was very much a loner.  This dated back to one of the
strangest childhoods I have ever heard described.

<p>
He lacked a lot of social graces,  hygiene was questionable (on
the one occasion I met him, at least), and he had a face that wouldn't
have been out of place on the cover of the <i>Enquirer</i>.

<p>
While it is unkind to speak ill of the dead these are the only
thoughts I have on him.   He wasn't a particularly good gamer.  He loved
the great fued(s).  And I think he was a voyeur when it came to the
interplay of monster egos in the hobby ((blush) including my own).
I believe he was younger than me by a bit so probably he was in
his late 30's or early 40's.

<p>
I guess what this is perhaps, is an effort to pull the rubber mask
back a bit so that it isn't just a dipster gone, but a hobby
character-warts and all that is recalled.

<i>((Thanks, Terry, for those illuminating remarks.
You do have the basic details correct and I agree with
most of what you say.
One of the things I strive for is being in the hobby and being real at
the same time.
Yet, within individual games, I choose to play out all sorts of 
``scenarios'' that include personality quirks that aren't completely
my own.
To me, szines are a great way of keeping playing games and 
interacting with people separate and, to be honest, I 
wonder about some of the E-Mail players sometimes who seem to treat
the Diplomacy hobby much more ``into'' the screen in front of their
face, without a human interaction backbone.
I found Chris to be one of the hobby's real odd ducks and while
I certainly have no desire to be telling other people what to do,
if the hobby really were dominated by those types of people,
I'd be outta here.
But it isn't and I'm not.))</i>

Basically, I've come to the point where I'm folding <i>League of Nations</i>.
Thus, you can remove me from your trade list.  
<i>((Do I have to.... you KNOW how I hate doing that....))</i>
I am subscribed to the <i>TAP</i> list, though, so I won't 
be missing anything, and I'll do something
postal-wise when I get my schedule straightened back out.

<p><br><p><br><b>Stan Johnson (undated note)</b>

<p>
Jim, I enjoyed Doug Beyerlein's letter.
I met Doug once at DipCon in Baltimore, 1976.
I'd be interested in the story behind why he left the hobby,
which he briefly mentioned.

<p>

<center>Stan, 1254 East Broadway Road #56, Mesa, AZ  85204</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I thought I reprinted it, or some of it, a little bit ago.
Basically, at the height of the Great Feud, Doug volunteered to
mediate a ``settlement'' and when his gracious and sincere offer
was rejected, he said that he'd had enough of it and left.
I believe I have those facts substantially correct.
His was one of the stellar voices in the hobby that we lost
because of the mid-80's feuding.
Quite frankly, it really wasn't any fun for any of us, but
personally I'm glad I stuck it out while FULLY understanding
Doug's position as well.))</i>

<p>
<p>
Some good rumors and stuff from me at the top....
thank you for those of you who wrote ``nice music issue'' comments on
#193.  I didn't think it was my best work, which gives me more
motivation to pull off a humdinger of a #200 with my 1997 music list
and general retrospective.

<p>
Here's some more ``stuff'' that's going on.
See my discussion with Tony Dickinson below on Chumbawamba.
It's great to have them back and challenging the ``status quo'' and
the copyright laws.
Speaking of copyright laws, how can you talk about copyright infringement
without mentioning the Gods of Infringement - Negativland??
Well, you can't, of course.
Coincidentally, they have a new album out which is likely to get their
asses sued off again.
Order it now, I haven't seen it in stores, so I have direct ordered
it from them, before they get thrown in jail and it becomes another
of their ``unavailable'' discs.
Order Seeland 017 for $13 from NEGATIVMAILORDERLAND, 1920 Monument 
Blvd., MF-1, Concord, CA  94520.
Or, ask Pete Gaughan to bop across town and buy it for you in person,
in what cannot be a coincidence.
Hey, Pete, what does 1920 Monument Blvd. actually look like?
Until I get it, I won't know for sure what or who it is that they
have challenged this time, but I have a guess that Pepsi is one of their
targets. 
Negativland's ``music'' is a wildly inventive mix of sampling, voiceovers,
and general weirdness and they've been working on this for three years,
so I expect it to show for the effort.
You may ask what the name of the album is?
Well, take the hint, Negativland is not revealing the name anywhere
in print that I've seen.
My guess is that it will be called <i>Dis-Pepsi</i>, thus, if correct,
you saw it in print here first.
Let's see, what of the Mekons?
I don't even know that much about the latest Mekons' album, but that
is due out in stores this week.
Wow, when it shines, it pours sunshine!!!

<p>
The ska explosion continues unabated this year, with the infectious
sense of fun making it possible to listen to the radio occasionally.
It's been difficult to miss the Mighty, Mighty Bosstones, but to
see where that is going, witness the following comments on the
radio today, regarding the Bosstones concert in a small club here
in Providence tomorrow night (according to the masthead).
Paraphrasing.... ``Get yourself down to the Strand tomorrow night,
the Bosstones show is not sold out yet, if you missed the big show
at Great Woods (the big, boring, suburban amphitheatre in which I
wouldn't be caught dead unless.... well, suffice it to say if I
ever go it will be because I have no choice....) you can still catch
them here in town.''
What???!!!
It should be the other way around.
There is NO band that is not better in a small club than in one of those
amphitheatres!!
Turn the radio off!!
Go to a club and stay out of the amphitheatres!!
Make that <i>Turn the Radio Off</i>, and that's Reel Big Fish's latest
ska album and the radio stations are being forced to make fun of themselves
by playing the first single, ``Sell Out'', which is an infectious bit of
ska fun.
``I don't think it'll be so bad''??
No, check out the masthead again!
Now to YOUR letters....

<p>
Dear Jim,  OK, I can take the hint.
Time for a letter, then.
Why does nobody find these people we're after?
<i>((I don't know, you'll really have to ask them.
It's funny, for some of them I really sensed that there was a lot of
effort going on, but for others, very little.
For Jerry Lucas, I haven't sensed much effort at all.
This next one will get people moving though.
As one might guess from what I said above, I've done some preliminary
searching from what I knew and I think I ``found'' my man.
I didn't ``disturb'' the trail or warn him.
This, of course, defeats some of the purpose; however, in return
I am requiring a FULL blown music letter for print in my #200th
issue.
That may actually take some ``Diplomacy'' to convince my target to do it.))</i>
Makes me wonder why I bother sometimes.

<p>
As a suggestion for zines to see, how about:

<p>
<i>For Whom the Die Rolls</i>, Keith Thomasson, 14 Stepnells,
Marsworth, N Tring, HERTS, HP23 4NQ, UK

<p>
<i>The Sprouts of Wrath</i>, Mark Wightman, 52 Park Road West, Bedford,
MK41 7SL, UK
 
<i>((Sample copies of my last two issues are winging their way over there
now.))</i>
That'll give you something to review, if nothing else.

<p>
Thank you, Pete, for the mention.
What did you want to ask me about universities?
<i>((We were talking about ``watering down'' universities by letting
too many people in who shouldn't be there.
The question was on that, plus the general recent history of 
university education in Britain.))</i>
Obviously, I've missed something somewhere.
<i>((Obviously.))</i>

<p>
You still have vinyl about?
<i>((Yes, I'm not buying any new vinyl, but I still have my old vinyl.
Charlotte keeps inquiring about moving it to the attic, but I won't 
let her.))</i>
God only knows where mine got to.
In my parents' attic probably.
Mind you, as I have nothing to play it on these days, it doesn't matter.
Where would we be without the CD?
<i>((Oh, I don't know... I actually liked vinyl.))</i>

<p>
Hope you enjoyed <i>OMR</i> 22.

<p>
Hi Jim,
Well hello there. Thanks for `<i>TAP</i>#193' ... certainly a surprise
when it came through the post box the other day! 
No probs re `stealing' my [already stolen!?] quote ... 
censorship really is a bad thing ...SHHH. 
<i>((Reading above, have you any doubt of that??))</i>
         
Yes as my fannish [ta! I think!?] review indicates the 
`Chumbawamba's are still alive and well and living in ... well this 
beloved desolate northern wasteland [the one thats doin' a fine job of
impersonating the Bahamas weather at the moment] somebody's got to I
suppose :-)  I was quite surprised that `Chumbawamba' are known in the
states.
 
<i>((I actually heard a rumor that Chumbawamba actually had released a 
new record over here (although it might well be a release of a
record they made years ago), but haven't seen it yet.  I'm a 
fan from way back..... I don't have it in front of me, but their
best in my eyes was that retrospective of ``protest" songs from
the ages.))</i>

<p>
To things `Chumbawamba' ...  last night I caught them on 
believe it or not `Top Of The Pops' [an ultra poppy chart- show thing,
yughhh!] with YES a new release ... `Tubthumping' it's called! And an 
NEW ALBUM is due out on the 8th Sept. [here in England at any rate, so 
dunno when that'll be in the states!?] ...  and that is to be called
<i>Tubthumper</i>!
<i>((I hear late September for the album release over here,
but they are having (fancy this) copyright problems over 
``graffiti'' and various quotes in the liner notes!
I now have heard the single too on the American radio and sounds
really great!
What timing for our little exchange, eh?))</i>

<p>
If this has all confused you [and forgive me if I sound 
condescending, I'm not honest] to tubthump(ing/er) means to bang 
on / go on about something over and over, though from what quaint little
origin this came from I'm not too sure! Hope that's been of some help  
anyway. 

<p>
As to their best album ...  erm  I think I'll have to go for 
<i>Anarchy</i> to be honest, hey ho we're all different. Oh the album you 
were on about is called <i>English Rebel Songs</i> , and yes it was/ is 
different, and quite powerful and evoking in its own way.
<i>((Those are actually the only two Chumbawamba records I 
actually own, but to be honest they are on vinyl and I haven't
played them in quite some time.))</i>

<p>
Well I really must be goin' now, so until the next time, all 
the best and take care,

<p>

<center>Yours Sincerely, Tony, L'n'P, Tony of tlmort.demon.co.uk</center><br>

<p>
PS: Oops! Quick ammendment ...  just had a thought and I decided
that my fave `Chumbas' recording HAS to be <i>Showbusiness</i> ... Why?! Well
I WAS THERE!!! What a crazy weekend that was ...  the `Chumbas' are so
special to me because they are so local ...  they had alot to do with my
very local area in the '82 miners strike [ my Dad was a miner ] ... they
record in the town next door to me! [ Castleford ] ... they are simply
put locals!
<i>((Well, that's one of the things we really try to do around here.
Let everyone share their local faves, so we can all find new great music.))</i>

<p>
Really?  You dare usurp my throne?  (Well, maybe you've got the yankee
version.)  Care to find out if there are any others of us out there?  Like,
maybe, inviting pun submissions?
<i>((Especially in press, they are ALWAYS welcome.))</i>

<p>
As a free sample, I offer the following:

<p>
The CIA once maintained a house somewhere in the South Pacific,
where they kept Argentine ex-president Juan Peron after he had been
deposed.  When he died, they brought South Vietnamese ex-president
Nguyen Van Thieu to the house.  When the Congressional Budget Office
inquired into the expense, the spooks replied by reasoning that Thieu
could live as cheaply as Juan.

<p>
Any more, you have to pay the usual fee for.  The ``usual fee" is a pun
from your collection.
<i>((Choose one from the press below, do you like the Wizard of Oz??))</i>

<p>
No sweat on the delay - in fact, it may even give me the chance to slip
this in under the wire:

<p>
I'm going to Pittsburgh tomorrow morning to go rafting on the
Youghiougheny River.  (This is part of my compensation package for
seven weeks of solo kid duty while Sondra was teaching in the
Adirondacks this summer.)  It is a Class V river, with actual danger of
injury or loss of life.  Accordingly, it is probably prudent for me to publish
my last Dip will, in case I am lost and presumed drowned.  In that event, I
bequeath my position in Suffren to Sherwood, with the request that
Hoffman and James stab his sorry ass at the first opportunity.

<p>
Have a great weekend.  Best wishes.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>It's time to at least think about another game opening.
What is really attractive to me is to run Vincent Mous' Modern
Diplomacy ten player variant.
There are about 50 supply centers and it is set across a map 
slightly more expansive than the original's European map.
This game is very popular on the Judges and has just been written
about by Chris Warren in the latest <i>Diplomacy World</i>.
The map and rules are there as well.
Subscribe and ask for Issue 83 to begin your subscription
by writing to Editor and Publisher Grand Hobby Poobah Kent
at 10214 Black Hickory Road, Dallas, TX  75243.
Write your check for $10 for four issues made out to Douglas Kent,
whomever he is, in the US.
Indeed, my sub is up so my check will be going out to GHP Kent too.
For Brits, Stephen Agar will take <i>$</i>7 for four issues
at 79 Florence Road, Brighton, East Sussex, BN1 6DL.
Canadians have to pay $15 for four issues.
If I get any interest, I'll print the rules and officially
announce a game opening.
If not, I'll wait until another regular game or two ends before
starting another regular Diplomacy game.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
John Schultz, Harry Andruschak, and Dave Partridge are signed up.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Otherwise Conrad is now the new editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117.

$10 gives you a life of the game sub, a bargain at twice the price
and it holds EVEN after you are eliminated.
The other $5 is for the NMR insurance calls, so please send along
your phone number as well.
I've got money from the following:
Roland Sasseville ($15), Don Williams ($15), Rick Desper ($10 - E-Mail NMR
insurance), Terry Tallman, Rich Goranson
Luke Dwyer ($15), 
and Jonas Johnson ($15).

<p>
I've drawn countries as follows:
Jonas Johnson (Britain), Rich Goranson (China), Roland Sasseville (France),
Rick Desper (Holland), Luke Dwyer (Japan), Don Williams (Russia), 
Terry Tallman (Turkey).
 
One last question, does anyone mind if we use all of the 
optional rules?  I'll discuss all that in full next time.
Could I also have people's full addresses, E-Mail, and phone numbers?
Then I'll get everything fully set up next time.
One thing I'm stealing from Jamie McQuinn (as is obvious from above),
I hate the ``seasons'' in the official rules.
The game will begin with Spring 1901 as the regular game does,
which won't be due until November 1st.

<i>Game Notes (firmly orbiting in the tropopause):</i>

<p>
1) Thanks to Lee Kendter, Jr.&nbsp;for the Round #6 Miller Number. 
For Round #7 (our FINAL ROUND!!!) Austria is Randy Ellis, 
England is Jeff Ellis, France is John Schultz,
Germany is Mike Barno, Italy is Luke Dwyer, Russia is Stu Lancaster,
and Turkey is Harry Andruschak.
Could we have a Round #7 Miller Number please??

<p>
2) For the rest of the game, if Jeff doesn't submit orders, his units
will hold and his nukes will go unfired.

<p>
3) I'm delaying this game because of the mail delivery delay and
from the request of one of the West Coast players.
If you did send orders, I do have them on file, but could everyone
else PLEASE get me orders for Spring by the 20th?
Thanks.
I have orders from nearly all of you; however, I don't have
any press, except for John's lament and Randy's quick aside below,
in addition to Harry's request.
This game is supposed to be FUN, with lots of press.
Let's do a break and see if we can reignite it.
Although I am delaying it, please remember that there is NO
reason to wait until fall is complete before negotiating for the
next year.
See the Round #7 line up ALREADY printed above.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ELLIS-ANDRUSCHAK): Quite correct, sir; however, it's always nice to get
a response one way or the other.

<p>
(JOHN BOY - GM): Hey, I got an extra whole day this time.
By the way, I'll be printing for awhile as I see you're having
a hard time with my press releases.
<i>((At times... but better me squint than not to get anything at all.))</i>
Still, my script can't possibly be as bad as yours!
<i>((It better not be!!
That's against the house rules - see above.))</i>
I wanna play the Black Hole thingie.
<i>((You're in, see above.))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): I respectfully request a one issue delay of this game,
with Spring 1906 being adjudicated in <i>TAP</i> #195 of 13 September
(or whenever).
<i>((Indeed, now it's 20 September.))</i>
It simply is not fair to the players to make deadlines so short.
It ruins the flow of the games.
Since we are into philosophers, I would remind you that Emerson felt
that a foolish consistency was the hobgoblin of little minds.
<i>((Yes, but I was playing bigger mind games on myself.
See above... still, calling on that Emerson quote probably 
guaranteed that you got your delay.))</i>
Would it not have been far better to put back <i>TAP</i> #194
3 weeks, to the deadline of 13 September, with <i>TAP</i> #195
re-scheduled for 4 October, and so on and so forth?
Please consider this option in the future.
<i>((I've pretty much decided that, without some personal emergency
that was unforeseen, if I can't keep more or less on deadline with
life as it is, then it's time to fold.
I decided LONG ago, that I will never creak and moan my way into a
fold.  If I go, it'll be clean.  I know VERY WELL that to all of
you, you don't see it that way, but for me I do.))</i>

<i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A number of draws are proposed: ARF, ARG, DIAS, FEAR, and 
concessions to Turkey, Russia, Italy, and Germany (TRIG!).
Please see the press below and vote on these proposals with your
Spring orders.
Failure to vote will result in simultaneous passage of all proposals!
Well, not really.
But vote anyway.
It'll be fun!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(STEVE to BOARD):  Sorry for the absence of press last time; I sent some in,
but Jim-Bob thought it was no good and decided to throw it away.

<p>
(BOOB to STEVE): Wrongo beef jerky breath, here it is, or was....

<p>
(RUSSIA - BOARD):  Okay, I've taken a lot of abuse for the ``jerks" line, 
and I guess I went too far.  But really guys.  Count up the dots and vote
sensibly.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  Oh, come, now, old boy, isn't the word jerk
somewhat lacking in creativity?  I expected more from you in the way of
invectives.  Would it help if we took up a collection and got you a
thesaurus?

<p>
(KEITH to THE VARIOUS POWERS): ...last time from this dateline was 
obviously black press.  I would never be so polite.

<p>
(SKYWALKER-KEITH): I did want to work with you and prevent your win
in a F/R draw, but you grew too fast, so I was forced to turn on you.
<i>((With some success, perhaps?))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): I think I might agree with you; we might
just be pushing Russia back.  As I see it, he has 15 and we have 19, so
this game isn't such a foregone conclusion as I once thought it was. 
HEY, SHERWOOD!  YOU FOLLOWING THIS, BUBBA?
     
(ST PETE): The butler's footsteps echoed throughout the cold, empty 
palace. He walked slowly down the bleak hallway, by paintings and 
suits of arms, and cold, lifeless fireplaces.  The butler's mind 
wandered as he made his way, none too quickly,  to the Czar's 
room.  He remembered how it used to be: gala balls with 
ambassadors from all of Europe's great powers, the intrigue of 
deals struck in back rooms thick with cigar smoke, dozens of 
servants scurrying around the palace. But the old butler was the 
only servant remaining in the palace now.  The others had trickled 
away as the war ground on and the balls became smaller and the 
ambassadors stopped calling.  Even that French fellow had stopped 
coming around lately.  ``Pity," thought the shambling butler, ``he 
was a good tipper."  No one ever visited now.  The palace was 
empty but for the butler and his master, the Czar.  The butler had 
stayed not out of loyalty, but only because he had known no other 
life for his 73 years.  He entered the Czar's office.  The Czar 
was in a fitful slumber, sleeping but getting no rest as he was 
tormented by his dreams.  Dreams of European domination.  Dreams 
that had turned into nightmares.  The butler was surprised to 
realize that although the Czar was only 33 years old, he looked 
nearly as old as the butler himself.  The butler cleared his 
throat differentially.  The Czar awoke with a start.  A hopeful 
look on the Czar's tormented face faded as he recognized his 
manservant.  ``Ach, Ivan, it's only you."  ``Yes, your majesty."  As 
if to confirm that he the Czar had been having the same nostalgic 
thoughts as the butler, he continued, ``Ach, Ivan, where have all 
my friends gone?  We had some good times, didn't we?  I used to  
enjoy receiving ambassadors and exchanging missives.  Now all I 
get is dreary news from the front.  Why don't the ambassadors come 
to visit any more, Ivan?"  ``Because you stabbed them in the back, 
your majesty," the butler replied matter of factly.  The butler 
was surprised to see regret cloud the face of his master.  ``If 
only I had one friend left.  Just a single ally to stand with me 
in my time of need!"  The butler was surprised by the seeming show 
of remorse. ``So you could defend the motherland, your majesty?" 
the butler ventured.  ``No, you old geezer, so I could stab them 
for the win!"

<p>
(BOOB to KEITH): Ummm, how about this:

<p>
(STEVE to KEITH):  I was terribly moved by your sad news that no one will
talk to you anymore.  They're probably scared off by all that blood on
your knife, some of which I know to be A-positive.

<p>
(BOOB to KEITH): No, how about if we return to regularly scheduled
programming:

<p>
(THE OFFICIAL SCHEDULED GERMAN RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN):
I propose the following dispositions of this game:  The Lil' Orphan Annie's
Dog Draw (ARF); the Long John Silver Draw (ARG); the Wimbledon
Draw (GRAF); the ``Buenos" (DIAS) Draw; the Stephen King Draw
(FEAR) (note my nobility of character here, in proposing a draw that
includes Pollard but not me); and the following concessions:  The Ivan
the Terrible Concession (to Russia); the Jacob Marley Concession (to
Italy or Turkey, take your pick); and the Aladdin Concession (to
Germany).  I tried to work in the Hot Dog Concession, to get at least a
tangential baseball reference in, but I just couldn't think of how to do it.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Dick Martin, and Vince Lutterbie
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is presently
missing, so I am running low on standbys here...).
Someone find Mike Mills!!
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!
Although press in this szine is generally black, I will make the
exception here that I will say who has NPRed and is ``at risk''
for being dropped. 
This time we have press from everyone except Michael, Keither, and the Duck.
They are ``on the bubble'' for next time!

<p>
3) A DIAS and GE (brings good things to life) draw proposals are on the
table.
Please vote with your Winter orders.
Failure to vote vetoes both draws.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BOOB to CASABLANCA): You will be safe, I guarantee it.
The letters of transit.... when will they be delivered?
French, Italians, and Turks are closing in on your position,
when will they attempt to arrive??

<p>
(ITALY): Fall 1907

<p>
(BOOB to SIMON): That was pretty wimpy press, but it did keep
you in the game..... anyone else with inane press??

<p>
(GERMANY - ENGLAND): Beep beep, boop boop boop, beep beep.

<p>
(AUSTRIA to FRANCE):  I wrote, I called, I e-mailed all my potential
allies who dropped like they deadwood they really are.  And of course the
mouthy Italian...

<p>
(PARIS to ANKARA):  Really, Keither...you insult the board with your
plodding moves and strategems, and then have the BALLS to
whine about how boring the game has gotten?

<p>
(TOAD to TRO):  Okay, can you support me into Moscow yet?  What??!!  The
German gets it???

<p>
(GERMANY - TURKEY): Nudge, nudge.

<p>
(AUSTRIA to ALL): The week after Dragonflight I have to go to Sacramento and
see a man about a horse but I will be home the last couple of days before
the con.  But I think this comes out after the con so....

<p>
(THE IMPERIOUS ONES IN PARIS):  ...and then there's the Russians.
Much of this game's alliance structure has been formed in 
reaction to the Cossack ``threat".  Now the only Russian ``threat"
is that they are going DOWN too quickly!

<p>
(AUSTRIA to LONG SINCE DEAD RUSSIA AND TURKEY):  Ok, so we are even for all
my dropped games in the mid 80's ok???

I've begun my write-up on Ghods too, but you won't see it for a long
time since it won't appear until 1997 KT ends. 
Then again, 1997 KT could be sailing into the Endgame pretty soon.
Anyone want to take
odds on whether I will finish my article before Mark finishes his
on 1994 KF?  I'm still waiting to discover whether my key suppositions
were correct that ultimately determined the outcome of the game.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The infamous IF draw is still rejected.
It is reproposed and if EVERYONE votes for it, it will pass in the
Summer season.
Recall, that No Vote Received = NO.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(OFFICIAL FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE QUOTE OF THE SEASON): ``The loss
of the center of gravity, resistance to the natural instincts -
in one word, `selflessness' - that is what was hitherto called
<i>morality</i>. - With the <i>Dawn</i> I first took up the fight
against the morality that would unself man.''
[coined by Nietzsche, ``unself'' is intended to echo Lady Macbeth's
lament to ``unsex me''] and (in a twofer) ``Among the conditions
for a <i>Dionysian</i> task are, in a decisive way, the hardness of
the hammer, the <i>joy even in destroying</i>.  The imperative,
``become hard!'' the most fundamental certainty <i>that all
creators are hard</i>, is the distinctive mark of a Dionysian nature.''
Both quotes are from <i>Ecce Homo</i>, the book which partly 
describes the intent and background behind all his other books.
Each quote is from the last words describing that book, the
first in describing the intent of <i>Dawn</i>, of course, and the second 
of <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>.

<p>
(DEAD ENGLAND): IF I'm Russia - no way do I let the IFfy IF pass
into IFninity. [cool word - or - should be]

<p>
(AUSTRIA-GM): ``Mindnumbing conclusion"? 
I thought you enjoyed this game. 

<p>
(BOOB-AUSTRIA): I do, but I'm trying to ``become hard'' ;-)

<p>
(JOHN BOY - NIETZSCHE): Once again, Emerson waits...
lockdown - you could understand that.

<p>
(MR. PARTRIDGE to MR. ROGERS):  That's wino you old sot!

<p>
(BOOB to AUSTRIA): No, the Wizard cannot be a wino....

<p>
(MR. PARTRIDGE to MR. ROGERS):  Can you say bonehead?  I knew you could.

<p>
(DAVY to MOMMY):  Mommmeeeee, he called me a name!  Waaaaaahh!

<p>
(GALLERY):  Will the real Mr Partridge please SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!

<p>
(WICKED WITCH 1 to WICKED WITCH 2): Can you believe how little they have
accomplished since we retired?

<p>
(WIZARD to WICKED WITCH): They're just following the ``Yellow''
Brick Road toward the ``Emerald'' City where all wishes will be granted.
Hyork, hyork, hyork...

<p>
(BOOB to DAF): Speaking of wishes...

<p>
(JOHN BOY - DAF): Oh, God!
The world has gone to hell in a handbasket!!!
I'm a friggin' dinosaur!!
Fake tattoos - Harley's as a hobby!
$25,000 MOTORCYCLES!
Now the lawyers <i>WANT</i> to look like me?!!!
Well, at least he <i>rode</i> his bike.
I hear tell of whole clubs that trailer their bikes to an event
for Chrissakes!!!
UNBELIEVABLE!!
<i>((Yes, well, wouldn't want to get your bike scratched or 
hit by road dust on the highway, would you?))</i>
Hope I can handle the culture shock.
Look forward to meeting the guy.
God, I'm a friggin' dinosaur!
Bucket-o-beer sounds great.
Shady spot too - guess <i>that</i> ain't went old fashioned yet.
Write me first, o-wonderful-one.
Your address is deep in a box at my sister's house.
<i>((You always can get it from me too when you need it.
Just let me know.
I hope you're not planning to drop out of touch with us here.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FGAT and a FGT draw are rejected.

<p>
2) Note that Charles has an E-Mail address, though he is pretty much
an E-Mail rookie, so don't overwhelm him to start.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> WORLD):  Seems that the UPS strike, struck my 
<i>Abyssinian Prince</i> #193.  I got the issue on Friday the 22nd and 
didn't bother to look at it until Sunday the 24th.  Only problem I was 
already late by then.  I called Jim and it seems that mail into 
California sat somewhere.  So I would have tried to coordinate my 
moves with you more, but it was move fast or don't move at all.  If 
you are reading this press it means that my new E-Mail link at work, works.  
     
(TURKEY-GM AND PLAYERS):  Speed up the game by combining seasons.  What kind
of crazy sacrilege is that?  Dip is supposed to be a slow game.  Besides,
once this game ends, I either have to get in a new one or pay again or drop
out?  I know I am a fool, so I won't ask you ``what kind of a fool do you
think I am?" but, what KIND of fool do you think I am?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> AUSTRIA):  As I said above, I would have dropped you a 
postcard asking for both, support into the Ukraine and how one or the 
other of us can move the Turkish fleet out of Venice.  I don't care  
who gets the center, just that the Turk loses it.

<p>
(TURKEY-AUSTRIA):  And I do not want to vote for the 3-way and exclude you,
dear old, ex buddy?  
     
GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> FRANCE):  I had to guess where you'd like me to move.  
I assumed that you may have a use for the fleets so they started 
heading west.  If not let me know and I'll move them elsewhere.  I 
also assumed that you'd like me to back out of Burgundy now.  So I 
did.  If not I'll move back, but I assumed that you'd want to use the 
new army there?  Well, anyway let me know, write soon and let me know 
what your next five year plan is.  Mine is to move south and put a 
push on the Turkish units there.  Again, let me know.

<p>
(TURKEY-FRANCE): I think building an Army violates your press a few seasons
ago when you promised to never build, move, attack, only to be in a
defensive shell.  Has that Hun got you thinking to do otherwise?  And, when
he gets bigger by eating me slowly, what do you think will happen to you? 
Are you prepared to go from a 4-way to a 3-way to a loss?  I'm prepared to
hope that you don't like that either.
     
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): I had some press for you.  But, you butt, I 
couldn't maybe next time.
	
(TURKEY-GERMANY):  Why did you ever think that I preferred a 3-way draw to a
4-way draw?  We're still in the interesting mid-game.  Do you want to form
an alliance?  PS-  Did you see the movie <i>Love Jones</i>?  I've got them, and
not for you.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Western Triple FEG has been reproposed.
Please vote with your Spring orders.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JOHN-HARRY): Thanks for hangin' in, guy!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-EVIL WESTERN TRIPLE): Just because I have no units on the
board does not silence me.

<p>
(RUSSIA IN EXHILE - THE WESTERN ``DRIVEL''): I'd a had me wiped out long
ago with all that superiority.
Boringly methodical, you guys!

<p>
(TURKEY-FRANCE): Je m'en branle!

<p>
(SCHULTZ-JAMES): Actually, I believe you can mark up two for my side.
Didn't you predict the same thing for Italy?
And I really would have liked to see Turkey survive me.
It would have been a more interesting end.
<i>((Don't talk ``end'' too soon....))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Put me back on the standby list again for
``hopeless positions'' of three dots or less.
I note that Austria is down to 2 dots in ``Suffren Succotash''
<i>((for which you are ineligible since you've already played here))</i>
and 3 in ``Columbus Chill'', Austria and Germany have 1 dot each
in ``Friedrich Nietzsche'', Germany 2 and England 1 in ``The Hermit''.
<i>((OK, but in general, I don't see ANY position as hopeless.
This particular position (the Turk here) was almost there because
of the nature of the board position and lack of dynamics at that time.
Actually, I find such situations pretty rare.
And, if you had survived a little longer here, SOMETHING might
have broken...))</i>

<p>
(JOHN BOY-GM): I think they're really gonna do it.
Still, there could be a double stab on Germany in the works.
<i>((Germany?
Care to take another stab at it??))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-MUSIC LOVERS): Instead of recommending the best new
CD of 1996 or 1997, how about a CD of a re-issue?
<i>((More than OK by me!))</i>
CBS MYK-37810 Sinfonia Concertante in E-Flat for Violin, Viola,
and Orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, K.&nbsp;364; the Cleveland
Orchestra conducted by George Szell.
In this day and age when ``period instruments'' seems to be a 
code word for sloppy playing, poor musicianship, and ho-hum
results, this CD is a reminder of what Szell and the 
Clevelanders could do as a modern orchestra playing modern
instruments when at their top of form.
A point to remember when listening to this work is that Mozart wrote 
the viola part for himself, and played the viola in the initial
performances of this work.
By the way, this CD also contains one of the best performances
of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto for those of you who care about
that sort of thing.
<i>((I have a recording of the Clarinet Concerto (which I dearly
love) in the kind of performance that Szell probably does by
the Vienna Philharmonic, though Szell's work on the Piano Concertos
with Brendel and other various pianists is so fine that I might
look for this recording just for that anyway.
Most of the time, though, I prefer the Stoltzman version with the
English Chamber Orchestra which is more ``fun''.))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): Atheism is based on unknowable faith?
Seems as if you are stretching the definition of ``faith'' there.
Unknowable as in ``we do not know if Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny,
or The Tooth Fairy do not exist, so it takes FAITH to not believe
in the existence of Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy''?
Duh.
Well, if that is your idea of what faith is about, I guess that explains
why so many insist that atheism is a religion.
``NOT believing in Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy is
a RELIGION!!''
To substitute the word ``God'' for SC, EB, or TF does not make more
or less sense to me.

<p>
(GM to HARRY): I'm actually pleased David has so carefully described what
could have been my argument.
David has all of the essential elements of what I would have
said back to you.
Some of what you said suggests that you really might be a
``show me agnostic''; however, you might choose to disagree
with that, so I wouldn't stand on it too strongly.
Still, I am not leaping from faith to religion, and SC, EB, and TF, to 
use your shorthand, are ``fun'' things that belong in an entirely 
different conceptual place.

<p>
(DAVE P to HARRY:  PMFJI, but as you say, the more press, the happier Jim
is.  It's always been my understanding that an atheist is someone
who asserts that there is no God, and as such has a fairly rigid
belief system.  An agnostic is someone who does not believe in God,
but does not actively assert that there is no God either.  There
are several classes of agnostics, the apathetic agnostic (don't know,
don't care), the show me agnostic (I've seen no evidence, so I can't
believe) and the occam's agnostic (it's simpler to postulate a
Universe that has existed forever or just popped into being than it
is to postulate a supreme being that has always existed or just
popped into being, and then created the universe).  Personally, I'm
an Occam's Agnostic, although I do believe in the Tooth Fairy, the
Easter Bunny and Santa Claus because I've got the quarters, eggs and
toys to prove they exist!
<i>((And wonderful that you do and your son do!))</i>

<p>
(STEVE to HARRY):  I thought the only proper answer to the question, ``What
do you wear under your kilt?" was ``Me socks, laddie."
