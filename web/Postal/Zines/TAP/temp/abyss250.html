All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
The next <i>Tinamou</i> deadline will be October 1, 2001.
I forgot to announce that last issue, but it would have been pushed back
to here anyway.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>This issue is dedicated to all victims of terrorism, in the US and around the world,
especially those who have died in recent days and their families and friends.
I offer prayers and hope that right thinking diplomacy will very soon change
the way the world works to bring communities together, rather than drive them
apart.
There is an essential humanity in all of us that can be accessed and tapped,
when approached in the right way.
I pray that this happens a lot more in the world in the near future.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>One may legitimately ask if I should be publishing this at all right now.
I have decided to do so, with deadlines pushed back.
I have let people know about this by E-Mail, but I have no idea how long
postal issues will take to get to their destinations.
What a way to have an anniversary....
I'm missing a whole lot of things that I wanted to put in here, but 
time to get it out.
I'll get caught up soon.

<p>
Thank you all for joining me as I reach my 250th issue.
It has taken me about seventeen and a half years to reach this plateau,
an average of about 14.5 issues per year.
I started this well after the only other American szine I know still publishing
in the 200's, <i>Cheesecake</i>, which runs with considerably longer deadlines.
We both are futilely chasing John Boardman and only slightly less futilely
chasing Conrad von Metzke.
By the way,
Andy Lischett currently is trolling for new players for the famed warehouse
szine and you can write to Andy for a sample of <i>Cheesecake</i> with his
current game openings at:
On the British side of the Atlantic, I have been VERY slowly catching up
to Pete Birks' <i>Greatest Hits</i>.
Pete is just a few issues ahead of me now, reaching #250 himself only a
few months ago.
Just a little insight into the useless trivia that runs through the minds
of long time szine publishers, connecting ourselves to the rest of the
community of the insane that do this sort of thing.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>                          Speaking of community, here are some updates about affected parties by recent
events in the Dip community.  
I was one of the people affected in a very minor way, having been in the air
when the hijackings were taking place, and landing at Chicago's Midway Airport
just as the first plane hit the World Trade Center.
I was stuck in Chicago for the rest of the week.
While my story pales in comparison to far more poignant and sad stories, 
I thought some might be interested in some of the details.
Then I will say something about my view of this crisis at this point.
Luckily, I was able to call my wife Charlotte upon landing in Chicago before
she knew anything about any of this, since we don't watch TV or listen to
radios in the morning at our house.
As we came off the plane, only the first tower had been hit.  
Right after I got off the phone with Charlotte, I went back to the TV to
see the second tower being hit live.
Then the phone lines were jammed and I was unable to call anywhere for the
next hour, so it was good (very good) that she knew I was safely on the ground.

<p>
I still had hopes that I might be able to fly to St. Louis (my actual 
destination) later that day, so I stayed around the gate area until they
began to sweep the airport for an airport shutdown.
This had me last on the list of looking for a hotel room once I made it out
to a phone in the outer airport lobby.
I got into this delightful little trucker's hotel near the airport that
actually was VERY clean.
I asked for a non-smoking room and the desk person practically laughed at me,
but my room smelled better and was cleaner than lots of expensive hotel rooms
I've been in.
It was a bit primitive, of course, but I had a fan to cool my computer down,
so I was all set. 
They had a big sign out on the marquee saying ``Great Food!''
Of course, this was in the trucker sense of the word as well - huge portions
and lots of fat - and the only beer in the bar was Budweiser.
I stayed there two days, watching how the staff knew and called all the truckers
by their first names and called me ``Mr. Burgess''.  I also watched how that
particular part of middle America reacted to the growing tragedy.
This is a VERY big country and there are widely varying levels of knowledge
though lots of unity of concern.

<p>
Finally, one of my colleagues (who made our joint presentation by himself 
to others stranded in St. Louis and looking for a distraction) rented a car
and drove up on Thursday.
I was trying hard to work in my room and communicated some on the Internet,
but he and I moved to a Hilton down the street, which was much nicer since
it had two phone lines so people could call me while I was connected.
Meanwhile, I was considering many options for getting home.
I am not shy in thanking Southwest Airlines for being completely forthcoming
and direct in updating its web page about likely future events. 
They very quickly informed me that Thursday flights were highly unlikely,
when United was allowing me to book a flight that was never going to go.
So, on Friday when Southwest said all systems were go, I headed back to the 
airport with my colleague.

<p>
And that was an adventure and a half.
We waited in the terminal line for two hours waiting to get our tickets
to get through the security checkpoint.
Just when we were to the head of the line, everything stopped.
There was a security problem, the first of what has been and will continue
to be many across the country.
The new procedure is that whenever there is a security question, they clear
the entire airport back outside the security checkpoint, do a full internal
sweep with dogs, etc., and then check everyone back in through security.
This takes a VERY long time.
Another two or three hours in this case.
The Southwest personnel attempted to lead a singalong and do song and dance
routines to entertain us as we sat saving our positions in line.
We all sang patriotic songs, as well as gospel numbers and weird songs
I'd never even heard before.
They also came out with food (well, pretzels and the like) and drink.
All I can say is that the talented employees at Southwest are the flight attendants
and they didn't seem to have them up there ;-)
But still, it did make the time pass more quickly.
Meanwhile various rumors spread about the sources of the security problem.
Apparently three men had something or said something at the checkpoint.
Two of them were arrested, but the third one wandered away, and they 
didn't know where, so they had to clear everything out.

<p>
All along, as other airlines were cancelling flights, the Southwest people
were trying to be as encouraging as they could.
If they could do anything about it, they WOULD get us where we were going,
but until the FAA let them get people back in the terminals and on flights
there was nothing they could do.
Finally, they did clear their way through all three Midway terminals and begin
to let people back in.
There were lots of security check points checking ID with police and 
security personnel, but the main metal detectors were staffed by the
same inadequate system that helped to contribute to the problem in the
first place. 
Plus enforcement was variable even on this one day and place where I was
observing it.
One person left a bag unattended and had it snatched by security and 
were themselves hauled away.
Another woman left FOUR large bags unattended for five minutes.
A security person came by worriedly asking whose bags these were,
but no one knew.
When the woman came back, I calmly warned her how lucky she was they didn't
just take all the bags away.
Personal opinion: in the first case, the security person could just grab the
bag and take it away, in the latter case, it was too many bags for the one
person to pick up, so he let it go.
As for me directly,
I have a belt that set off the metal detector, as it usually does.
But the security person was distracted by me handing him my pager and
in all the noise and confusion, he didn't hear the alarm.
He asked me to show him that the pager worked, and I did.
Then I asked him what next and he said: ``go on, that's all''.
I thought about arguing with him that I set off the detector, but
shrugged and went on.
All this uncertainty and variability was quite frustrating.
I hope there is something they can do about this eventually, but only with
some REAL incentives or government systems to do it.
Allowing the airlines to run this the way they do continues to be a farce.

<p>
Once we got in, finding the gates was difficult because Southwest and the
other airlines were trying to push planes through as quickly as they could
to catch up. 
I was talking to some Southwest pilots who (seriously) were looking for their
planes. 
The boards were all messed up and they couldn't figure out where they were
supposed to be.
Amazingly, we found OUR flight and it wasn't even very crowded.
It makes one wonder what this system will be like with full flights?
We may never find out, as the airlines are quickly moving to cancel
flights and lay off personnel.
Just from that one Friday, I have a feeling that Southwest will be one
of the fighters and their situation, operating mostly in the smaller
airports, will put them in a fairly good situation.

<p>
The flight itself was extremely uneventful and I finally made it home
at 11:00 PM, after leaving for the airport in Chicago twelve hours before.
It looks like America is going to have to become a helluva lot more
patient than it has been.
I wonder if we have the maturity to do it, I really do.
Well, perhaps, in the near term we will do it with a MUCH smaller air
transportation system.
In any case, I found my experience to be an adventure, but not a tragedy.
There are so many people facing real tragedies and it was them that I
was thinking about.

<p>
The rest of the szine after this was more or less completed BEFORE the
events of the 11th.
I just didn't think that I should push this out (in addition, being
trapped in Chicago messed up lots of plans) until a bit of time has
passed.
But I agree with everyone who says that we MUST continue to live our
lives, laughing and grieving, but moving on in the best way we can.
That includes this szine.
I hope you enjoy what follows.
But before that, I do have one more serious thing to say to all of you
as Diplomacy players.
It was percolating in my mind because of some of my thinking about the
Palestinians even before the hijackings and air crashes.
I welcome any comments that anyone else wishes to make for next issue
and like I did this issue with my comments about the Palestinians,
I will try to let all of your comments be the last word.
This is mine (given present events anyway).
But I do welcome other comments if people want to make them.
Please note if you want your notes on this subject sent to me
NOT to be printed, otherwise I will assume you are sending them
to me for print.

<p>
We have seen an intensity of terrorism and hate and destruction
that DOES make the hoary overused metaphor of war meaningful.
How can anyone describe the scene in lower Manhattan as anything
but a war zone?
All of us have felt the intense sadness that watching the images
of these events conjures up.
I, like many others, had those days afterward (also perhaps feeling
a bit sorry for myself alone in a trucker motel where I didn't
even feel like getting together with Russ Rusnak or Jim O'Kelley
who offered) periods when tears and anger would just well up in me.
But I also see the need not to act out of pure emotion, that more
than ever we need to plan and plot using all of these Diplomatic
skills that all of us have honed in years of playing this 
wonderful game.
I hope our leaders have oodles and oodles of the same skills.

<p>
I suppose part of this is the economist in me that abhors unintended
consequences that are unconsidered, but I think of the orphans in 
Afghanistan NOW (not counting any more we might create in the near future).
And I think of the eight relief workers that are 
under arrest by the Taliban on charges of ``preaching Christianity''
since they are Christians who were trying to help these desperately 
poor Afghani people.
And I think about the Afghani opposition leader, murdered by two
suicide bombers posing as journalists a few days before the plane
hijackings.
And I wonder what the policy would be that would end all this,
really and truly end it.
Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually.
I think of the Marshall Plan after World War II and I think of the
people who have said that we should have a Marshall Plan for New
York City to rebuild it.
And of course we should.
But I wonder how much MORE important is a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan.
Even were we to arrest, convict, kill, or otherwise eliminate Osama
bin Laden from his Afghan lair, that hate for us and our system of
values (which from their perspective is not without merit) will live on.
And unlike the Hitler comparisons that many have made (and largely apply
to an evil person like Saddam Hussein), Osama bin Laden has his position
among his followers mostly from a position of love.
They love him.
It obviously is a love twisted to a monstrous goal of murder and ethnic
cleansing (cleansing non-Islam people from ``Islam holy places''), but
it is a type of love.
If someone murdered Saddam Hussein, I would at least question whether he
would become a martyr or not.
He rules through fear and evil.
The unintended consequences that are possible with bin Laden are much more
dangerous, in my view.
I can envision US military personnel protecting a program of rebuilding 
Afghanistan..... building schools for the orphans and other children
and adults (the literacy rate there is well below 30% putting in a 
very, very select company of the least educated countries on Earth
with the likes of Chad and Burkina Faso  - speaking to aware Dippers,
I realize that you know most of that, but still...), building hospitals
and giving desperately needed health care, as well as helping to 
build economic structures that will allow the people to clothe and
feed themselves.
This would involve working with opposition groups in Afghanistan, that
unfortunately are badly splintered with the death of their unifying
leader, but it could be done.
This type of Marshall Plan helped to build a Europe that is an economic
powerhouse, if only we could be a tenth as successful elsewhere
in places like Afghanistan.
Yes, it would require something akin to a long occupation, but I think
it would be worth it.

<p>
This is the only way that this group of orphans and displaced Afghanis
do not become the suicide bombers of tomorrow.
Somehow and somewhere the cycles of violence must stop.
Can this be understood?
Because, sure, one must at the same time bring perpetrators of murder
and violence as well as supporters of those actions to justice, 
but unless we can begin touching on the root causes, 
this is only the beginning of an unending battle.
I'm sorry if that labels me in certain quarters as insensitive, but
that's the way it is, as I see it.
If one wants to look at it selfishly, it is this argument that is used
in some quarters to defend welfare plans to people who believe that everyone
should stand on their own two feet.
Helping others protects us from revolution.
If one sees our current problems as partially caused by an inability of
the intelligence community to infiltrate terrorist groups, one needs 
this sort of loose-tight approach to begin to make those inroads.
Why would ANY Islamic militant be willing to become a double agent
otherwise?
Confiscate financial resources of Osama bin Laden as a downpayment,
to be sure.
But donate ten times that out of our own resources to start to build
a world where we CAN be safe.
As another timing issue why this was done when it was, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund were scheduled to meet this weekend
(not sure as of this writing what is happening with that) to discuss
plans for ``changing the mission" of these organizations.  
A realization was striking them that some way needed to be found to 
alleviate poverty around the world for real, rather than have the
goals of multi-national corporations hiding behind every policy 
and program.
Only this way could the economies of these desperately poor countries
be turned around.
It would be a terrible shame if Osama bin Laden stops that meeting from
happening.

<p>
To me this all is coming under sharp contrast.  I like to think of
this szine as supporting a worldwide community of Diplomacy players.
Can there be worldwide communities more generally that destroy
the hatred that arises from fear and prejudice?
I hope so.
I pray so.
WE must demand it.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR BILL QUINN</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Bill Quinn was the Boardman Number Custodian in the mid-1980's and won the
Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service to the Hobby in 1986.
More specifically, he was Publisher of <i>Everything</i> during the 
Don Ditter and Kathy Byrne Caruso Custodianships (issue numbers 53-62)
and then took over the Boardman Number Custodianship itself from 
August 1984 to August 1986.
Bill was known for his efforts to organize the BNC records and as
a tireless worker at the task, during a period of one of the highest
rates of game starts in the history of the position.
Naturally, Bill burned out on this eventually and has dropped out of sight.
I think it is time to find him again....

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

<p>
The Summer issue is finally out and I hope you've found it worth waiting for.
There is a ``wrap-up" of the 1999 WorldMasters tournament, 
some new variants from Scott Morris, my interview with the Finnish Diplomacy
player Vesa Virri, some other great articles, plus an editorial from 
Stephen Agar.
Stephen had a processing disaster with a hard disk crash on his
computer and the first draft of the issue was lost, but 
we did manage to reconstruct it.
I need to keep remembering to back up all of my Dip stuff so this doesn't 
happen to me someday.
Since, a few weeks ago, I had an E-Mail disaster and if we had to reconstruct
this issue again, it would not happen.
I had all of my attachments wiped out, though the E-Mail is substantially
intact.

<p>
If you want to subscribe in paper form at $3 per issue, 
North American subs should be sent to David Partridge, 
15 Woodland Drive, Brookline, NH 03033, USA. 
Stephen Agar is handling international postal subscriptions and you can write
to him at: 47 Preston Drove, Brighton, BN1 6LA, UK.
Issues from Stephen will cost you 2 GBP in the UK and 3 GBP for the rest of 
the world.

<p>
I am finishing up the resolution of back subs for <i>Diplomacy World</i>
from the Doug Kent era.  
If you were a subber to <i>Diplomacy World</i> and think you should have
been contacted and were not, let me know, otherwise I think this all is
resolved.
Thank you to all those who have responded,
especially all of the KIND comments I received about starting this up again.
They were most appreciated.

<b>2001 Hobby Awards News - WINNERS ANNOUNCED!!!</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Thank you to all of the voters.
We had a dramatic increase in the number of voters, about four times as
many as last year, so I hope this is the beginning of an upsurge in
attention.
All of the nominees received at least two votes, so there was wide breadth
in the voting and many of the votes were very close.
I also received a number of write-in votes.
In keeping with tradition, I will not be announcing vote totals, but
I thank everyone for their comments, donations, and votes.
The winners will be receiving plaques as usual.
The Committee currently consists of myself (Chair), Fred Davis (Treasurer), 
Gary Behnen, Melinda Holley, Jamie Dreier, Paul Kenny, and Robert Lesco.
I am looking for more committee members, especially for someone from 
Europe, Australia/New Zealand, or elsewhere.
Anyone interested should contact me.
I shall start soliciting nominees again for the 2002 Awards in January of 
2002.
I hope with a quicker start that the process can be smoother next year
than it was this year.
I will get a ``one page'' announcement of these results for postal
szines shortly, but please advertise the winners widely.

Thanks for <i>TAP</i>.
<i>((You're quite welcome!!))</i>

<p>
ManorCon was quite fun and yes the game would have turned out very
differently had you been playing Russia. With your replacement I had a
fairly easy time of it and comfortably topped the board. I doubt I would
have with you there.

<p>
The problem for me was that my curry disagreed with me and I spent Sunday
morning with diarrhoea/vomiting so couldn't build on that result. Oh well.
That'll teach me next year.

<p>
<i>(( I hope the Mind Sports Olympiad went well this weekend!
In retrospect then, I am ***GLAD*** that I missed Dinner on
Friday night (I probably would have tried the curry....)!!))</i>

<p>
The Mind Sports Olympia has been a bit of a headache but still. Hopefully we
got some new dip players as a result and if so then it was worth it.

``Hey, Mike, if you get this, please confirm again exactly when it is 
your bus is arriving. - Marc Peters"

<p>
THREE AND A HALF GODDAM HOURS AFTER SCHEDULED, sir!!!
Actually one of the scheduled two buses on that busy route went there
close to on time - without me, because my Cleveland-to-Chicago run was 
delayed by a half-hour food stop at Thruway rest-area prices almost as 
expensive as Greyhound stations' own food.  Waiting for the next run 
cost me a $20 cab fare I wouldn't have needed earlier.  The return bus 
trip was worse starting when Greyhound screwed me in Chicago - I was 
the FIRST ONE IN LINE at Gate 9 once the 4:45 buses had filled at 5:00. 

<p>
Gates 7 and 9 were scheduled and announced for this run's two 5:45 
buses and gate 8 was for the reboarders.  Instead the first bus driver 
(at 7) took New York/Newark direct people and ditched me, filling his 
holes with Gate 7 people from a line that was over forty people long.  I 
waited there but the second bus, already very late, pulled into Gate 7's 
lane after the first bus left and the SECOND bus driver also took Gate 
7's line, insisting that I do so.  He asked for one or two people to 
fill his last holes, took one person that included some 
distraction/delay, and left with me standing at the HEAD of the Gate 7 
line.  Missing that connection (leaving 1 hour and 40 minutes later than 
booked) made me lose hours more on each connection including the extra 
connection that had to be added in Syracuse due to different runs in the 
later timeframe.  So I also had to add a ten-dollar cabfare to my 
mother's place where she was dogsitting Mary Jane for me.

<p>
THE BRIGHT SIDE IS:
Travel was the ONLY part of MadCon that was less than an excellent and 
worthwhile time!  Only about ten people were there, only about eight at 
a time, but a lot of games were played and a lot of friendships were 
renewed.  I hadn't seen lots of people in about ten years... i.e. since 
the last MadCon I attended.  Several people among those contacted had 
expressed hope or intent to come, but ended up backing out late.

<p>
Speaking of late I'll wrap this up real tidy.  We played two good games 
of Diplomacy (both voted as 3-way draws, in Spring '07 and Winter '05 or 
'06); four games of Ohne Furcht und Adel (Citadelles - I hope the US 
edition is available soon); two games of Stephenson's Rocket (which was 
the only choo-choo game played if I'm not mistaken); two games of The 
Princes of Florence; dozens (it seemed) of games of Manhattan because it 
takes half an hour and lets you choose whom you compete against; at 
least three games of Titan; one good noisy game of Junta; a long session 
of four-player sheepshead (small cardset, more than half the cards 
trump) where I came out furthest ahead in the only game we played for 
cash (Russ ended up paying the rest of the table); and maybe some other 
game that I slept through.

<p>
Two newbies (Craig Reges, who learned Dip in 1974, and his son Phil) on 
Sunday; everyone else was veterans of at least three MadCons (I think) 
although Deb's sister/Bakko's wife Karen wasn't a gamer most years. 
Both, uh, Regeses were friendly and played Dip and learned Ohne Furcht 
und Adel.  I think everybody who played any games learned at least one 
new game.  (Mine was Manhattan, which I'd seen but hadn't played.) 
Everybody had fun and everybody got along.  When discussion of one 
MadCon veteran on the outs with a few others failed to fade away after a 
couple of minutes, I took a long walk through Sun Prairie seeing its 
(old) Town Hall (``For Rent":  a sign of corrupt town government?) and 
other unspectacular sights.  Problem risks were thus averted.  Nobody 
even yelled at each other in traditional ``Goddammit Rusnak!!" fashion 
beyond some games' typical Madison intra-game noise.  Nobody was set 
afire nor arrested in connection with the very colorful backyard 
fireworks.  If any drunks puked or broke anything, I'm not aware of it.

<p>
When all the Madisonians had various nongame activities for parts of 
Sunday after its third game, I joined Dan Sellers' ride Bill Becker in 
Bill's new Chrysler PT Cruiser to Chicago.  We dropped in at Russ' place 
with Tom Johnston there.  Wouldn't you know, two more Princes of 
Florence games and a Titan game... no, not really, just two Princes of 
Florence games and one Settlers of Catan game ``because who cares if it's 
2am; how many MadCons do you get anymore".

<p>
I had an absolutely tremendous time and I think everyone had at least a 
definitely good time.  It might not happen again so I'm glad I overcame 
the travel issues to get there, and play every game at least once, and 
play with everyone except Debi and Karen who did a whole lot of food 
prep and laughed at the rest of us.

<p>
Undiluted helluva con.

Jim, please let me congratulate you now for having reached 250 issues.
This level of perseverance is unfathomable to me; I could never imagine
publishing a zine for 25 issues, let alone ten times that number.  (I do
note that you have implemented one crucial improvement since issue #200,
namely, the use of printed address labels.  No doubt this was inspired by
protests from USPS personnel, who were tired of trying to figure out
whether you were sending mail to Poughkeepsie or Zanzibar.)

<i>((Haha, I will say that the ONE regret I have over the past two 
decades is that I took so long to switch to computer generated labels.
Some luddite sense within me got hung up on the idea that it would
be more difficult.
Of course, it really is ten times easier!!
By this point, what I call ``szineness'' is part of my life.
I can't imagine NOT publishing a szine, so I likely will continue to do so.
I've said many times though, this is my baby.... if I had children, this
might be the thing to go.
I understood this early on as this definition from the Official Encyclopedia
of the Diplomacy Hobby, the Diplomacy AtoZ states:

<p>
BOOB'S RULE OF SZINE PUBLISHING (1)  &lt; MN:Aug96 &gt;  Jim Burgess' rule that
having a child permanently doubles turnaround time and this increases
exponentially with each additional child.  Eventually, as they grow up,
turnaround time begins to slowly drop. The pubber's comfort level
with turnaround delays determines whether the zine folds or fades away.
Also known as the Dick Rule, after Gregg Dick whose zine faded away and
finally folded.))</i>

Hi Jim:
When I gave my brief report of Madcon, I mentioned that none of us
retained the ``facial hair" of our youth.  You said that you still had yours:
I don't remember your having a beard or mustache....

I still have all the hair on TOP of my head, if that's what you were

<i>((Also, you commented in your szine about ``material" and staying on

but I try not to ``whine" about missing material.  Nobody really
cares anyway ;-) and it makes you sound peevish.  Please let me
know if I do that too much.... I don't like to.  BUT, games only
work if you KEEP THE SZINE ON TIME.  Most of the players REALLY
don't care if you held up the szine to get another article in
and the interest in games quickly wanes.  Surely, non-playing
readers do care, but let 'em wait... that's what I say!!))</i>

<p>
Well, this last issue just caught me during a bad week.  The fact that I had
NO games that had all the orders in at deadline time on top of a lot of
pressure in the real world (tm) kinda put me out of sorts.  I'll take a
laxative for the next issue, and be back to my usual cheery self.  I'll also

I missed the New Order shows out on the west coast.  I see that they are
touring Europe this fall.  I listened to an interview where they indicated
that a tour of North America could happen in the spring.  If they come to
the Boston area maybe I could meet you. Their new single ``Crystal" is
excellent, but I wish that we could have gotten the version in the US that
they released in Japan.  The Japanese release also includes four live songs
(including Joy Division ``covers") from the 1998 Reading Festival.  Don't
know if I want to pay close to 30 bucks for the import.  The full length
album (``NEWORDER GETREADY" - dumb title) has been released in the UK and is
due out in the States in October.  I've listened to it on-line and it sounds
promising.  I guess they are having a little difficulty connecting with some
audiences given their lengthy absence.  Their core fans are old guys like me
who are still living in the 80s musically.  The young folks haven't ever
heard of them and don't know or appreciate their unique history and
contibutions.

<p>
Did you see the back page editorial in a recent issue of TIME magazine about
80s alternative music?  It was talking about how alternative music from the
80s which was only available on a small number of radio stations is now
being featured prominently on several television commercials.  I can't think
of the examples they used, but I know that I often hear The Clash in the
background of mainstream radio commercials.  The writer was also remembering
when alternative meant something more than Limp Biskit!

``Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" - a movie

<p>
This is a very funny movie.  It is also possibly the most offensive movie I 
have seen.  Tough call.  Most of the offense came from Jay, the slacker 
without a clue.  Even though he was offensive throughout, he delivered it 
with such an air of innocence that you just knew he had no idea he was being 
offensive.  He wasn't being a bigot so much as being an ignoramus.  Usually I 
can not endure such a character.  I think it is partly because the player 
almost always lets you know that he isn't really that stupid, it is just a 
role.  With Jay you sort of forget that there is a role being played.  A 
really truly very funny movie.

<p>
It even has a story of sorts.  A preposterous story, but what the heck?

``Curse of the Jade Scorpion" - a movie

<p>
Good story.  Snappy dialogue.  I say `snappy' because this is set in the 40's 
when dialogue was snappy.  At least in the good movies.  

<p>
We have Helen Hunt who is rapidly becoming the blond who is in everything 
(used to be Meg Ryan) playing the Katherine Hepburn character, the woman 
executive who is smarter than the men she works with.  Woody Allen cast 
himself in the Spencer Tracy role (Woody loves to play cruel jokes on 
himself).

<p>
This is a jewel theft mystery that is preposterous in reality but perfect in 
the film noir genre that is being satirized.

I loved it.

``Ghosts of Mars" ... a movie

<p>
As many of you may have observed I am drawn to Science Fiction and action.
I have as many `B' movie on my must see list as not.  It is rare that a `B' 
movie is also a good movie.  Sorry about that.  This is not the exception.

<p>
Long on gore and action.  Short on story.   

<p>
Seems humans have come to Mars and are making it over to suit their needs.
They open a crypt of ancient Martians (who knew?) whose ghosts come forth 
(more demons than ghosts) to possess any humans within reach.  The ghosts 
seem to have a sort of `Road Warrior' fashion sense.  So their first acts
are to mark up their new bodies with decorative cuts and piercings.  Their
second acts are to kill anyone not possessed. 

<p>
The story is narrated to a governing body by Natasha Hensridge, who makes a 
very good action hero.  She is the only survivor of a patrol of cops sent to
the mining town where this all took place to bring back a recently captured 
bad-ass played by Ice Tea.  He is such a respected bad-ass that a whole
bunch of cops are sent even though he has already been arrested and is in custody.

<p>
Naturally the governing body doesn't believe her story.  Would you?  Doesn't
matter, because despite the tactical nuke that Hensridge used to try to stop
the ghosts, they were not stopped.  The ghosts invade the city and start a 
whole new rampage just in time for the closing credits. 

<p>
There you go, Jeff.  This time I did say what the movie was about.

far as I trust people - pretty short.  As best I can remember anyway.  So,
the reason that I started this was about that thing that you say in the
thing I'm writing about.  I don't think I am in that type class that you say.

2.   Re;  Steve Hutton, you, and Nastios.  Evidence indicates that other
cultures and other persons can take HIV cocktails successfully; treat HIV
successfully and cope with the cultural changes to sustain these
strategies.
San Francisco is having a major and significant increase in unsafe sex and
HIV infections.  I concur with you labeling arguments regarding the cultural
difficulty of AIDS in Africa as ``racist."
I concur that the major issue seems to be the multinational
pharmaceutical companies providing drugs at the true cost of production in
one continent and at a rate that will produce ongoing billions of profits in
the other continents.  Call me a ``consipiracy theorist."  Maybe it is
because I believe that government is best when it does nothing, but when it
does do something, the most common need is to protect the individual against
the rich and powerful:  whether government, corporations or individuals.
Not so strangely, the multinationals are escaping single government control
and attempting to create the political and racist arguments to distract from
economic ones.

<p>
However, I really wanted to talk more about the risk of antibiotic
resistance.  This is a growing and soon to be more major problem, with
likely result of further enriching the multinational pharmaceutical
industry.  However, the statements in <i>TAP</i> #249 regarding taking all of the
antibiotics prescribed is ignorant, wrong and another example of old-wives
tale and experience not being supported by evidence.

<p>
The evidence basis for antibiotic resistance is that most people in
the USA take antibiotics because they are prescribed antibiotics and because
they believe in antibiotics.  However, most antibiotics are not indicated
and do not diminish the burden of the disease the individual is trying to
diminish.  Most prescribing health care professionals do not follow
guidelines for prescribing and most do not follow the guidelines for short
course antibiotics.

<p>
Taking all of one's antibiotics is more likely to create resistance
than stopping when one is feeling better.  Really.  Fact is strange when it
meshes with old-wives wisdom.
Most resistance occurs by plasmid exchange and other types of resistance
not from the organism that was intended as the target of the antibiotic but
from the development of resistance from other species of bacteria that then
transfer that resistance to other species, including eventually to the
species that was being targeted.

<p>
I've never taken an entire prescription of antibiotics in my adult,
post-professional education life.  
<i>((Ditto.... for the same reasons, since I am a health economist, I am
equally aware of this evidence, at least generally, not clinically.
Thanks for taking this to task...))</i>
None of my kids have ever taken
antibiotics for very long, sometimes not more than one dose, certainly not
for the entire prescription.  Nor did I advise my patients to do so - after
a while, except for very specific infections such as TB (which you
mentioned) or subacute bacterial endocarditis.  We just don't know how long
is optimal for taking antibiotics.  And not just because most research is
funded by the multinational pharmaceuticals.

<p>
I am working with two state-wide coalitions regarding antibiotic
resistance and recently challenged them on the same issues.  Surprise!
The larger issue seems to be agricultural usage of antibiotics fairly
indiscriminately and also for rapid growth in animals that some humans eat.
My organization is working to organize a national meeting on this.
Interesting stuff.  Another great reason to be a vegetarian.

<p>
3.  An insurance company recently told me that if I purchased 32 CDs they
would reimburse me about 80% of the cost to me.  This on top of some money
whether or not I did.  This made the proverbial ``Which 10 CDs would you
take to a desert island with you?" very real.  First off, though, this was in
addition to anything I already own - which makes the question a little bit
skewed.  However, still a bit interesting for your music section.

<p>
Rather than tease you with curiosity, I bought my first ever Beatles
CDs, filled out more of my Grateful Dead collection and Garcia CDs; a couple
reggae (I have very little and this was a Marley and a Big Mountain); 
<i>((I couldn't live without my Bob Marley's....))</i>
a couple of swing (Big Sandy and the Fly Rite Boys), some blues (I didn't have
a complete list of what I had or not when I went, so not much in this area),
another Shania Twain, best of Cher, best of the Who and fairly other pop
music/not so distinctive purchases.

<p>
4.  Great big kudos to you for publishing the coming gaming and dip events.
This has been something I've sorely missed since Lee and then (my dementia
is acting up, TX police person after Lee Kendter) did so with the game
openings.  Certainly motivates me to plan a couple of cameos.

Hanan Ashrawi at the top of the last issue: ``so what will this look

Since, that is what I was thinking.
I got a few interesting reactions, but they didn't touch the nature of
the pure ``play of the game of Diplomacy" with true high stakes that
I was thinking about.
This is clearly a war and we are involved as surely as we are the
world's only superpower.
So, in ten years, if there still are no serious negotiations where
Israel trades land for security - in particular many of the most
precariously sited West Bank Settlements - then Israel is going to
be overwhelmed by the population problem.
In other words, are the settlements supportable or tenable?
In Diplomacy terms, are the Palestinians crazy like foxes in waiting
out the Israelis with the nature of the continuing warfare?
Who is it who REALLY doesn't want to negotiate?
I'll leave that as my last word and let others comment.))</i>

Hi Jim-Bob,

<p>
Just got #249 in the mail today, and I enjoyed it thoroughly,
particularly your account of the first part of your Europe trip. I
would've liked to have gone, and if I knew my summer schedule earlier I
might have been able to make it. I've put a line in my resume online
about what I've been doing this summer BTW in case your interested (it's
nothing economics related, unless you count some side research and
practical knowledge as to why Microsoft has come to dominate the
operating system market).
<i>((Thanks, Tim, we would be interested in hearing about
that if you get a chance.  
You can find Tim's resume at: http://home.uchicago.edu/&nbsp;btmiller/resume.html
where he is studying to be an Economist, like me...))</i>

<p>
I also was interested by your editorial re the Israeli Palestinian
conflict. You raise a couple of interesting points, but I think one of
the things you might have missed is that the Palestinians are not trying
to *be* diplomats in the sense of the western definition of the world. I
don't really look at the PLO as a modern state conducting modern (i.e.
Renaissance and after) diplomacy. It strikes me from what I have read as
more of a quasi-feudal structure organized loosely around one vague goal
(some form of Palestinian state). Now of course there are other feudal
political agents at work, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, pro-Settlement Jews on
the Israeli side, etc. I think ultimately peace will only come to the
middle east when the Palestinians find someone who can build their
organization into a modern state-like structure, and who can then force
the Israelis to bargain at the table, and force Israel into ``fair play"
diplomacy. Someone like Ataturk or Lycurgus to use an ancient example, a
real **builder** who is more than an idealogue.

<p><br><p><br><b>Saul Spiel (Friday, August 24, 2001 12:30 AM)</b>

<p>
Dear Jim, 

<p>
I received your latest issue of TAP #249. I was surprised by your choice of
using quotations by Ms. Hanan Ashrawi. As an amateur historian, I wonder 
about the accuracy of her evaluations given her obvious advocacy. It is 
usually more telling to hear her criticize her own government. Ms. Ashrawi 
does complain about official corruption.
 
<p>
Ms. Ashrawi believes the settlements are a major obstacle to peace. Why?
Was there peace before the settlements? What if they aren't an obstacle, but
just another excuse to wage a war of attrition? Why should the West Bank be free 
of Jewish towns? There are many Palestinian towns and cities in Israel. In 
fact out of six million Israeli citizens, one million are Palestinian. 
 
<p>
After Israel's War of Independence, there were Palestinians and Jews on
both sides of the border. The Arabs on the Israeli side were given citizenship. 
Those Jews living in the West Bank that could not flee were killed. From 
1948-1967 Jerusalem was split in two &amp; the West Bank was ethnically cleansed
of Jews including the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. After the Six 
Day War, some Israelis decided to live in the West Bank. For some reason now
their towns are called settlements. (I guess the Jewish controlled media 
missed correcting that misconception.)
 
<p>
I think Ms. Ashrawi knows how sardonic it is to criticize their fortress 
appearance. If her people choose to protest with flowers &amp; slogans instead
of stones and bullets, the walls may come down. Why are no Palestinian peace 
rallies?
  
<p>
Ms. Ashrawi would like to see the West Bank exclusively Muslim again. Would 
that be rewarding the ethnic cleansers in the West Bank when it was under 
Jordanian control?
 
<p>
In over a 3000 year history, Jerusalem was divided only for 19 years. Ms. 
Ashrawi would like to see Jerusalem re-divided. One doesn't have to be
Solomon to know the rightful mother would not want the baby cut in two.
 
<p>
She would like to see Palestinians work in Israel without the humiliation
of crossing security checkpoints. What can her government do to ease the fears 
of the Israelis?
 
<p>
It has been over 7 years since the Palestinian authority took total control
over all the refugee camps in Gaza &amp; the West Bank. The refugees still live 
there. They used to complain that their people live in squalor. They were 
vocal when the camps were built by the Jordanians and Egyptians. They 
complained when the Israelis took control of them 19 years later. Why have 
they made no effort to dismantle any of them? Perhaps because they breed 
discontent. How can they be still called refugees in a refugee camp, when
they are in their own land under their own elected leadership? (Another fact 
ignored by the Jewish controlled media?)
 
<p>
I too am an advocate. I was very much in favor of the Oslo peace accord. 
Even retrospectively, it was important to try it.  Israel needs peace with 
her neighbors, because that is the neighborhood she is stuck with. But the 
failure of Oslo is and has been that only one group was ready for what
Arafat called ``the peace of the brave." Israeli schoolbooks do not vilify Muslims. 
Are the Palestinians ready to follow suit? Israeli's do not celebrate the 
death of Muslims. Will the Palestinians end their hero worship of martyrs? 
 
<p>
The Palestinian leadership rewards the families of suicide bombers. One 
cannot negotiate with suicide bombers. One can hope to change the atmosphere
in which they are raised.  This generation of Palestinians are not ready to 
live in peace. 
 
<p>
I hope you can place this letter in almost the same prominence as your 
original propaganda piece.

(DOWN AT THE BARROOM WITH SHREEVY):  It was an odd night at the barroom, 
because the topic eventually and briefly came around to literature. 
Crazy Henry had just made a comment about the classic Mae West scene 
in which she asks ``Is that a banana in your pocket or are you just 
happy to see me?"

<p>
For a change, I made a comment. ``Ill have you know that the idea 
goes back to a Victorian writer. 
This fellow, Anonymous, wrote a story called The Cremorne, where 
he had Louisa say:
``Gracious! Its more like a clarinet. 
Wally, have you something stuffed in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"
<i>((And isn't that comment preceded by 
``What's that little piccolo down there?''
Which is where the ``more like" comes from??))</i> 

<p>
Shreevy just snorted. ``Both these were Johnny come latelys. 
How about back in 1843, when there was this other story by somebody called 
Anonymous? Its name is Eveline. Little Eveline asks," 

<p>
`What have you got in your pocket, John? Is it a flute?'
<i>((And doesn't THIS flute also get bigger and bigger...))</i>

<p>
There were comments as to how the concept seems to have developed from 
its beginning. Crazy Henry and others noted the usefulness of ``Anonymous" 
as a literary device, although quite not in those words. 

<p>
I was about to suggest that, for certain aristocrats in the 16th century, 
passing poems and plays along to Shakespeare was the equivalent to 
the later usage of ``anonymous" in the 19th century. 
However, the main topic swept along and soon everyone was talking about 
the fishing out on the bay.

<p>
1) The RAG draw passed and the RG draw failed.
I should just note that according to standard
rules on these sorts of things, had BOTH passed,
we would have used the SMALLER one.
I thank all of you for playing, it seemed like it was a fun and
interesting game.
Comments from you??
I'll do the Supply Center Chart sooner than later, I hope!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to WORLD): These should be my final orders.  So long, farewell, it
was fun while it lasted...

<p>
(FRANCE to EUROPE): Well, it's now or never.  Either I survive or I don't.
Let's see how it goes, hm?

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): Yep, you outlasted me.  I can see you sticking out your
tongue from here.  At least I survived longer than Emmert.

<p>
(BOOB to ENGLAND AND FRANCE): You actually both survived equally.  If
you WANTED to be eliminated, you didn't want to vote for the draw...
;-)

<p>
(AUSTRIA - GERMANY): I'll give it some thought and get
back to you. Promise. 
<i>((OK, but that would seem to be a bit irrelevant now...))</i>

<p>
(JAMES to EMMERT): I just got my SU season basketball tickets for this year.
Only a couple more months until college hoops and caring about reading the
sports page again. They have had a stellar recruiting year again.  This year
they will be good, but not great. Next year they will win the Big East, and
in 2004 they will be a Final Four team and contend for the National
Championship - you read it here first. 
<i>((We did indeed....))</i>
 
<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Well, we're to Labor Day, and as of today I have picked the
leaders of all 6 MLB divisions...if you use my picks from last year.  I'd
have picked the Giants in the NL West had I known how much more their new
ballpark was pulling in.  They went from a small-market team to a big-market
team in a hurry.  But the most important thing we need to learn from this
year is that it is just THAT:  a YEAR!  162 games.  Nobody clinches a
playoff berth by Memorial Day, or even the Fourth of July.  All those
prognosticators that jumped on the Minnesota bandwagon have come crashing
down with it.  They CAN'T win.  The schedule won't let them.  They have to
have their whole team last the whole year, and eventually the actuarial
tables catch up with them.  It took a bit longer than I'd have thought, but
heck, you can even win money in Las Vegas from time to time too, if you get
lucky.  But the house will win in the end, and so will the big-markets.
Yankees over Braves.  Gonna watch?
<i>((If that's the matchup, NO WAY.
See comments elsewhere....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
3) The Sprint Line is coming up AFTER square 40, but if I count
correctly NO ONE can pass it next turn.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB): Mayhap Eric is hoping his score will be flooded
with points.

<p>
(BOOB to WHITE MAID): It looks like YOUR team is the one flooded with
points.
You have just set a <i>TAP</i> record for highest replenishment at 23!

<p>
(CHRISTIE to TWILIGHT ZONE): As I remember it, the story ends with some
reference to following a horses arse.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
I think we might do it with ``wings''.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Drugs have long been the currency
of the Central Intelligence Agency, USA, and EEC, a long dull story
of corruption."
From ``Brutal'' sung with brutal frankness by our very own Sally Timms.
This is on <i>Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<p>
(THE LAST WORD FOR #250): I put this quote in BEFORE recent terrorist events
and the need to start a new war on terrorism/drugs (where Osama bin
Laden has processed much of his continuing money), but it is interesting
that I chose that..... bye now, blessings and good wishes to all!!

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to SPAIN): ``Never interrupt an enemy while he's making 
a mistake."  -Napoleon

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Well, I would say you're in deep trouble.

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Take that Italian scum.

<p>
(ROME-MADRID): We shall retreat till we can't retreat no more.

<p>
(UKRAINE-BRITAIN): Oh come on, I thought we were friends. I only took Stp to 
keep Germany from taking it.  Or is it I haven't advanced on Ber sooner.

<p>
(POLAND-UKRAINE): Liberate us and we'll rise against the Kaiser.

<p>
(RUSSIA-BOARD): Last time I looked in the rules there was no liberation rule. 
Should we make one?

<p>
(BOOB to LIBERATORS): It is always legal according to my house rules to
concede the game to an eliminated player as long as you all vote affirmatively
for it.
Try that if you like....

<p>
(ANOTHER CONVERSATION KIRK AND SPOCK):

<p>
Spock: Captain, I've been studying some earth history in my spare time.
In particular, the 2001 Boston Red Sox.
<i>((Oh please, torture me some more why don't you??))</i>
Their best player, Nomar Garciaparra, was injured most of the year.
Their best pitcher, Pedro the Great, was injured for half the year, and
a full 1/3 of their roster spent 60% of the season on the disabled list.

<p>
Kirk: What's your point?

<p>
Spock: Their manager, Jimy Williams, was highly regarded around the league
and was in fact in the running for Manager of the Year for keeping the
Red Sox in the race, yet the General Manager fired him in the middle of
the stretch run.
I find this action completely illogical!

<p>
Kirk: Spock, there are some actions of human behavior that are simply 
unexplainable.

<p>
Spock: You mean like Disco, Puff Daddy, and the ending to the new
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> movie?

<p>
Kirk: Exactly.

<p>
(FRANCE-RUSSIA): The day we can liberate a country in the game of Diplomacy is 
the day I hang up my sword. As well as my knife.

<p>
(BOOB to ``FRANCE''): That is, of course, SO ironic....

<p>
(SPANISH NEWS): The cannibal killers roaming Spain's capital park has been 
eliminated. Spainish intell has made a astonishing discovery as well. Most 
of the killers were American democrats and Republicans. This new development 
has the Spanish government and intell dumbfounded. The Spanish people are 
also astonished at the news that Republican and democrat's joined forces in 
cannibalistic attacks here in Spain. Thought we have now found evidence of 
the same thing in the U.S.A.

<p>
(SPANISH NEWS PART 2): Evidence now shows the people were only eaten by the 
democrats when they refused to give money and the Republicans ate the people 
who gave money. There is also evidence that both ate people when someone 
mentioned Al Gore who showed his stupidity in Florida which thus showed the 
American people that he couldn't even cheat George Bush Jr in the race for 
Presidency which as far as the evidence is concerned and the American's 
concern is even Al Gore's fellow democrats If you couldn't beat Bush in the 
race then you shouldn't try for presidency and it's even worse when you can't 
beat him from cheating.
Please note that my mom is a democrat and my dad is Republican and I vote 
for whoever I feel can run this country best. Also note that to a degree I 
ragged on Bush as well by virtually saying he was a weak runner. I went 
after Al Gore since he couldn't even beat Bush the right way or by cheating. 
At the time I could see why Saddam Insane doesn't listen to the U.S and I 
can just see him shaking his head.
American idiots.
Well, I figured I ought to ragg on everyone here, even me.

<p>
(MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH PART 2): A lady sleeps with a man that never wakes 
up. Though she is curious if he's sleeping comfortably, but it's hard to 
digest with the hole in his chest.

<p>
(MEKONS QUOTE OF THE YEAR): Retaliation is must. The enemy must suffer the 
mother--ing consequences. Dead lead. I want everyone of these 
mother'ers not breathing.

<p>
(MEKONS REPORTS): Who are we the Mekons who have never been heard from the 
future of the world. To what sense do we make to the people who hear us. Is 
there a man alive that understands us. Is there a woman that would like to 
be with us. Is there a man to fight us. For how can a man fight we he can't 
see nor can a man fight what he doesn't know. To this we ask the...

<p>
(BOOB to ILLICIT MEKONS QUOTERS): I can sensor your press if you are going
to make up these things.
Go get yourself some REAL Mekons quotes.
There are more than enough of those to last a lifetime.
And lots of people understand them.... hee, hee, hee.

1) Hey, we're already late.... SC chart forthcoming sometime.
I'm waiting for Don Williams.... ;-)

<p>
<p>No more here yet..... they're probably waiting for that spellbinding SC chart.
Don Williams says he is sending me an Endgame statement now, so that will 
finish it one way or the other.
Can I get the SC chart out before Don gets me an Endgame statement..... stay
tuned for the thrilling conclusion.....
Rich Goranson and Andy York are relishing their free issues while we work it out.
