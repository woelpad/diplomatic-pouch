``We gonna pitch a Wang Dang Doodle all night long... all night long,
all night long...''  lyrics by Willie Dixon, sung by Koko Taylor.

<p>
Go to Vertigo Games XII and pitch that Wang Dang Doodle all night long!!

<p><br><p><br>NEWS FLASH: Hasbro has taken over Avalon Hill, including the 
rights to Diplomacy, and laid off all current employees.
There is no word at this time what will be done to the game,
or what Hasbro's relationship to the hobby will be.
A discussion is beginning that will address what stance we (the hobby)
should take (proactive in some way for sure) toward Hasbro.
More on this next issue, but if you want to be part of the
discussion, send the MESSAGE:

<p>

<p>
to majordomo of diplom.org, it works just like the tap mailing list
described below.  Sending messages to hasbro of devel.diplom.org
sends the mail to the whole list.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product of Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.
Nevertheless, Hasbro may not agree with that stance.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Lots of interesting reading in this issue, with some material
held for next time.
Since I had a pretty small window for getting this issue done 
around some other time committments AND that THREE, count 'em,
THREE, games ended last issue.
I have held up the Game Reports and will put all of them in the
next issue.
As a result, I've also extended the deadline for the receipt of
end game statements and all of the players get one more issue
in their life of the game sub.  
That should be a fair deal for everyone but me.
As a follow up to the apologies of last time, I misplaced some
letters which I have found for this time.
They should be in there below.
In particular, there is a revised final season for 
Covington Cross since I did have Stan Johnson's orders after all!
And, in addition to that, I missed said pretty small time window
and am getting this out in time I didn't think I had (and probably don't).
This pushes deadlines back yet another week, which I thought I couldn't
do, but now will work.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
This price is sure to rise in the near future as I add pages
and subszines and like.
I am trying to decide how much to raise it.
Any subs that come in before I announce the new price will be
counted with these rates, of course.
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
His szine <i>Metamorphosis</i> may be found there, along with the
latest issue of this szine, plus some information on John Caruso's
baseball league - which yours truly plays in.
I still want to review David's web site in some detail and will do so
presently.
His ``version'' of this szine is somewhat more html.friendly
than the one I created, so please check it out.
Also, look at the Caruso baseball league chat to see what some
old semi-retired Dippers are up to with their spare time.
I'm doing real well again this season while trying to play for next year.
Next year, when I'll be aiming for the World Championship, I'll 
probably stink up the joint.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR JOHN MICHALSKI AND AL PEARSON</center><br></b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Yes, this is a ``two-fer" and these guys will be on the main 
list until issue 215.
Michalski's address is known to many people, I believe, but 
you need to get him to write me a letter!
As far as I know, no one has heard from Al since he received
a job promotion over ten years ago and resigned from all his
games.
I was a standby for him in at least one of those games.
John, of course, is best known for his roving subszine, 
<i>Mos Eisley Spaceport</i> and Al was one of the great
szine publishers of the early 80's.
More on them and their publications in future issues.
Go to it, guys, each one is worth $50 in cash and prizes!!

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Dan Stafford is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mike Barno (5/26/98)</b>

<p>
``Search for Sleaze'':  Last time I called Stafford's adoption of an 
orphaned United league his ``main positive contribution to the hobby.''
That's because I'm cynical about his other hobby project, a rating system.
I think it was total Calhamer Points over the last five yours or
however long it took to make Dan come out on top of the rankings.
He sent occasional updates to Tom Swider and me for <i>The Shogun's
Sword</i>.
We published them despite chuckling at the self-promotion.

<p>
<i>((I lost this one temporarily and Mike then tried to recreate it...))</i>

<p>
<p><b>Mike Barno (21 July 1998)</b>

<p>
I think the only item worth restating from the letter and the press
that disappeared
<i>((I found them.... sheepish grin....))</i>
was a note on Dan Stafford's one fling with Hobby Custodian-Type Activity.
In the early eighties, Dan would occasionally compile standings for his
rating system (Calhamer points in the most recent five years, or
however long since he'd started winning postal Dip games), and
send them to a couple of pubbers.
One was Tom Swider, whom I helped with <i>The Shogun's Sword</i>.
When I eased Tom out the door, er, saved <i>TSS</i> when he would
have folded it, I continued carrying what I called the
``Staffordness Rankings''.
They were a brag sheet (designed to remind people that Stafford and
Kathy Byrne won most in that era) but I wasn't about to turn down
hobby-relevant stuff for my subscribers to read.

<p>
<p> 
Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>See potentially earthshattering note above.
Would you like Hasbro to make Diplomacy into a CD-Rom shoot-'em-up,
like it did with Risk when it bought that?
I consider it a distinct possibility.

<p>
I also want to HEAVILY promote the upcoming Vertigo Games XII that
Brad Wilson is holding in the usual Paoli location just outside Philadelphia
over Labor Day weekend.
Unlike other years, the event does not start until around noon on
Saturday and then runs through the rest of the weekend.
I am trying to figure out how much and how I will attend, but I WILL be there.
I've promised such things far too often and not followed through, but I've
worked too hard this year not to play a little.
I'm going.
Full directions and details can be obtained from me by E-Mail or snail mail.
You can also write directly to Brad Wilson at 123 N. 3rd St., Easton, PA  
18042-1803 - not where the con is being held.
I wanted to put all the directions in here, but holding up the szine to type
them did not seem like a good idea.
Jack and Maria McHugh, Paul and Sandy Kenny, Tom Swider, Mike Barno, 
and the adorable Courtemanche family are all likely co-host/attendees.
This quite simply is the best housecon still extant, even if Brad does
auction off beds in ways perceived obnoxious by some.
You also get to hear Jack McHugh snore, an earthshattering event not to be missed!

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
Then, I'm going to set a slate of 20 or so (perhaps more at the rate
my thinking is going) and DEMAND votes from you out there.
I may get a bit obnoxious on that score as the great freedom to work and play
will generate a responsibility to offer some opinions as we near the end of
the century.
I intend to have a lot of fun with this, and hope all of you do too.
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; and Koko Taylor singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

<p>
I'm not going to choose one this issue, I'm busy sorting through a
bunch of possible selections.  Instead, I'm going to add two
my own to the bullpen.
<i>There's Something About Mary</i>, Rhode Island's Farrelly brothers
latest flick, features a guy as the Greek chorus who is VERY familiar
to <i>TAP</i> readers.  
Yes, it's none other than Jonathan Richman!
He did a cameo in <i>Kingpin</i> and has a neat meaty role here.
Hie yourself out to see this one!
It's one of the best of the summer.
Another ``summer'' song in the sense of being ``hot'' is Buster Poindexter's
(aka David Johanson, ex-New York Dolls) ``Hot, Hot, Hot''.
Is it too much a novelty song??

<p>
The ``bullpen'' is the list of suggestions that people make
that I haven't decided whether or not to include yet.
Comments on the bullpen are, of course, actively encouraged.

<p>
BULLPEN: ``Fire on the Mountain'' - the Grateful Dead; Devo - ``Whip It"; 
B Movie - ``Nowhere Girl"; B-52s - ``Give Me Back My Man" or ``Rock Lobster"; ``Roadrunner'' - Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers; ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' -
Buster Poindexter.

In case you don't read <i>Northern Flame ((I don't.))</i>:
`` `(Dawn Upshaw) records <i>exclusively</i> (emphasis added) for
Nonesuch, Teldec, and Erato.
She may also be heard on Angel/EMI, Sony Classical, Deutsche Grammophon,
London and Telarc.'
I wonder if this writer also does wedding vows.''
<i>((Indeed, thanks Mike, for passing that along.
Actually, it sounds more like a writer cribbing from a publicist shill
sheet.
You know, if you want to write a review of something, you can just
take what the artist's publicist sends you, use that as boilerplate,
add a few choice adjectives of your own, and you're done.))</i>

<p>
No no no!
It's ``pitch a Wang Dang Doodle'', not ``pinch your...''
The point of the song is declaring a party with raucous music.
The ``sawdust on the floor'' is to dance on without scuffing and
tripping.
<i>((I know, I know.... I've never been all that great with lyrics,
as anyone who has been with me for a long time knows.
On this one, I had this feeling I had it wrong, so I went and listened
to that part about 20 times over.
Then I decided that if the lyric wasn't what I thought it was, I didn't
know what it was, so I just stuck it in there.
I figured, if I was wrong, someone might tell me and I'd find out something.
If I had asked what it was, no one would have answered me and I wouldn't
have known anything (with my luck on mini-contests around here).
I've now determined that the best way to run a contest is to make
intentional and unintentional mistakes.))</i>

<p>
I can't give you a recommendation for a `Fire on the Mountain''
recording, as all of my versions are on bootlegs.
It's not even on the greatest-hits album <i>Skeletons From the Closet</i>.
<i>((You will give me some credit for realizing upfront the bootleg
likelihood....))</i>
Oops, wait - I have some CDs but no working CD player, and a check
of these neglected discs shows ``Fire'' on the <i>Shakedown Street</i>
album (1978).
It's a good version, but no Dead recordings capture the magic of a 
live show.
Even a good cover band jamming on the foundations of this tune in a
park can turn strangers to friends and turn friends to lovers.

<p>

<center>Mike, 634 Dawson Hill Road, Spencer, NY  14883</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I might have <b>Shakedown Street</b> somewhere.... now I think I
recall the tune.
This was while I was part of the program staff on my college radio 
station which, like most college radio program staffs of the time,
were sharply divided into pro-Dead and anti-Dead with never the
twain shall meet.
As you know, I was on the anti-Dead side, but I've always liked
some Dead songs.
There was one song on that album that I really liked, I'll try to
find the album and listen to it to discover if that's the one.
If it is, it probably will go on the list, because that's exactly
the kind of song I'm looking for - the one that even makes the
non-fans of the artist groove.
One artist who is causing my brain (and feet) no end of despair is George
Clinton.
I ***MUST*** have a Parliament/Funkadelic/Clinton song on this list, but
I'll be damned if I can decide which one.
Is it the original poppy ``I Just Wanna Testify'',
the blasting funk of ``Let's Take It to the Stage'', the silliness of
Bootsy's Rubber Band which puts the current swing revival to shame
with songs like ``The Pinocchio Theory'', or one of innumerable great
songs of the 80's?
Help gratefully appreciated....))</i>

Hi Jim,
I do not get around to writing about music too often, but it has always been
an interest of mine.  As you may or may not know I was a DJ for eight years.
<i>((I remember...))</i>
I did schools and weddings as well as the last two years at the Rusty Scupper
before they were closed.  What motivated this quick note was the recent B-52
and Pretenders concert I went to last weekend at Great Woods.  For those who
are not locals Great Woods is an excellent venue for music.  It is an outdoor
partly enclosed stadium with excellent acoustics.
	
I guess because I was a child of the eighties my musical tastes will always
keep some part of that era in mind.  Like any period of music, much of it is
fluff and one hit wonders come and go.  The Pretenders however still have it.
I did not realize at the time how many hits they actually had and that several
of their tunes have been used in ads, background music, and other
things over the years.  
Chrissy still has a powerful voice and belted out all the classics.
<i>((At the time of their highest popularity, I recall that she was
one of the few people (Sting was the other) who actually filled an arena
with their charisma and voice.
In the meantime, I have sworn off arena concerts and haven't been to
one in ten years.))</i>
The only time she silenced the crowd was when she sang a ballad in Spanish
that is on her new album.  It was OK but this was not the audience for a
Spanish ballad.  Other than this the Pretenders were awesome.
	
The B-52's were also excellent.  You rarely see a more energetic group on
stage.  Due to a stupid curfew they had just a one song encore, 
``Rock Lobster'',
which ended the night on a high note.  Most of their songs were excellent with
a good selection from their many albums.  One thing though, is it just me or
are the songs with the guy in them better than those with just the girls?  
Anyway, I am going to Lilith Fair in August and maybe the Bare Naked 
Ladies free concert in Boston next week.  The new song one week is getting 
a ton of airplay around here and it isn't even out yet.  
How does he sing so fast yet so clearly?
<i>((Yeah, it has my ear grabbed too!))</i>

<p>
Jim, I agree with Brad Wilson's recent comments regarding General 
Washington.
Washington had seen the troops behave well in New England and I believe
his overly optimistic disposition on Long Island and New York were based
on expecting a similar performance there.
In addition to the qualities Brad mentions, both Washington and Arnold
had the ability to inspire their troops to extraordinary efforts.
I recently read two historical novels dealing with the same series
of battles on the New York/Canadian border, from different sides:
<i>Sargeant Lamb's America</i> by Robert Graves and <i>Rabble in Arms</i>
by Kenneth Roberts.
Arnold came off well in both books.

<p>
To John Schultz, while the heart of the American people is often
in the right place; the heart of the Government rarely is.
Very few decisions our Government makes about who to support
overseas would be approved by the people, if they knew the facts.
I also agree with many of Mr. Harrington's statements.
Often, when I hear someone talking about how Americans live better
than anywhere else or have the most freedom: I ask them, ``Have you
ever been anywhere else?''
The usual answer is no; so I ask them what their statements are
based on; it's usually someone/The Government told them so;
and they didn't need to think about it on their own.
With so many people doing time for non-violent drug offenses and 
property being seized from people who have not been found guilty
of any crime; I don't see America as being a very free place.
You have a right to say no; the antidrug commercials scream you
have a right to say no; but no right to say yes.
That seems to be the kind of rights we have in America these days.
With the average murderer doing six years and people doing life
without possibility of parole for possession of marijuana, I don't
think much of our justice system either.

<p>
Of course, we do get to spend our national treasure and the lives of
our best young people sending military forces all over the world
sticking their noses into everybody's business; rather than 
wasting that money on improving the quality of life here at home.

Jim-Bob,
I know what you mean.  I feel rather burned out from work also-there are
just too many projects going on at the same time.  Combined with that,
playing with the kids and helping Cathy get them ready for bed, other
domestic duties and keeping fit has just about used up all of my free
time-then if you want to do something special like go to a movie or go
camping (like we are this weekend), there goes the rest of it. 

<p>
My brother Kurt likes the new Mekons album.  I read the review of it and
it really wasn't all that informative about the music-the review just
focused on the sexually explicit ``concept album" lyrics.  How do the
songs musically measure up to <i>Retreat from Memphis</i> or <i>Rock 'N' Roll</i>? 
<i>((Actually, surprisingly well.
I am liking the record more and more the more I play it!
It has bouncy and infectious beats like some of the songs on the two records
you mention.
I may have time to say more about it in a future issue.))</i>

<p>
There's a new Loud Family album out called <i>Days for Days</i> and the review I
read was favorable.  Can't wait to get it-I'll probably order it
directly thru the Web because my closest record store that sold hip music
went out of business about a year or so ago and local chain stores
probably won't have it.

<p>
I saw Terry Tallman a month ago-he and his wife Judy held a house con at
their new ranchette.  They have about a dozen horses and the huge log
cabin they live in is gorgeous-the kind of home I wouldn't mind having
built for ourselves someday.  I'm not the do-it-yourself Jeremiah Johnson
type but being a ranger dude I can appreciate the rustic aesthetic. 
Cathy and Ryan were sick so Shannon and I took the ferry across the Sound
to Port Orchard to get there.  It was an hour wait for the
Edmonds-Kingston boat and not worth the wait, but Shannon liked the ride
on the ``bus boat."  Steve and Daf Langley were there-it was nice to see
them again and I haven't seen them in 4 years.  Steve is working long
hours for a computer consulting firm programming to solve the Year 2000
virus.  He says the problem is real, and although it won't bring about
the end of the world, it will cause some chaos.  Also met an acquaintance
of Terry's.  We played a game of the Settlers of Catan with the 6 of us
(Shannon played too-she needed help and although her 2 little villages
got boxed in, she did fine for 5 years old).  That's all who showed up-
Pacific Northwest cons just attract a few deadwood and their offspring. 
The next Deadwoodcon at our house in the Washington Cascades will be
October 10-12, 1998. Anyone is welcome, just let me know if you'll be
coming and I'll get you directions.  I'm even willing to pick up people
from SeaTac airport.  One thing I'll say about all our housecons in the
NW: they're free!  Not like Shorecon, which charges a fee for everything,
including how much floor space you'll need to roll your sleeping bag on
(Brad charges by the square foot I hear).  But you folks ``Back East" are
used to paying fees for everything I guess.

<p>
Music:
Jim, I owe you and your readers quite a lot of thanks.  Over the years you
have included reviews of so many great albums and bands.  I follow-up on a
fair number of those that sound within my area of interest and close to it
but potentially able to point me in a new direction.  I was recently
reminded of such when perusing the local ``Underground" <i>The Bay Guardian</i>, I
saw that that very night, Son Seals was to play in John Lee Hooker's
``Boom-Boom Room."  Never having been to this newer establishment and only
knowing about Son Seals because of you and your readers, I went to the
show.  Small bar.  Tables for maybe 60 people.  Dance floor for about that
number. My lucky night, got there as the first band was finishing and all
the seats were taken and the dance floor was empty.  I ``had" to go stand on
the dance floor (Someone from the first row of tables actually got up and
pulled my sleeve to let me know that I was obscuring his view.  I shrugged
and told him he hadn't seen nothin' yet) and then others started coming and
it was moot).  Well, pretty soon the bands playing, after a couple of hot
songs they bring out Son and the place started swaying with hot electric
Chicago blues.  They were technically great - but no one in the band ever
smiled except when I bought one of the CDs and told the bass player - you
guys ought to look like you are enjoying yourselves, eh?)

<p>
I saw the Commander recently in a similar size bar in Mill Valley - ``The
Sweetwater" which probably has the best musical talent of any similar
venue.  That would be interesting - to see who thinks they have a local bar
that has the same quality.  And then divide the quality by the number of
people who live within 10 miles of the bar.  I can't imagine that
Sweetwater wouldn't win.  I was again forced to take a spot right next to
the stage - they don't really have a dance floor there except standing as
the side ``people" for the band's right.  They enjoyed themselves.  They
played well, but it was almost song for song from their Greatest Hits
release and had only a little explorational inspiration.  (Oh, for those
who aren't anywhere near as old as I am, Commander Cody and the Lost Planet
Spacemen had some very large hits, mostly anti-establishment up with drugs
song such as ``Lost in the Ozone," ``Hot Rod Lincoln" and ``(Down to) Seeds &amp;
Stems (Again)."  I first saw them in LA in about 1973 with Black Oak
Arkansas.
	
My first mega-concert of the summer (but coming up in quick succession
are:  Pretenders/B52s; <i>((See Roland's review of that combo above...
I picked up Roland as a subber from your szine, you will recall, even
though he lives a few miles away from me.))</i>
BBKing/Neville Brothers; Santana/Los Lobos.  Then
the mighty Russian River Jazz festival and the SF Blues Festival.  Oh my
goodness) - Rusted Root (Okay, I admit, I never heard of them, they are
Phish-like, 8 instruments no horns) and then Hot Tuna in its newest version
of Jorma and Jack and a drummer, keyboardist and rhythm guitar.  No Will
Scarlet and new blues harp.  They had more instruments playing then I
prefer for the pure lines that Jorma and Jack put out and then play off
each other so exquisitely.  Mostly jass-blues in selection, half new
stuff.  The best of the night (Ok, maybe the first peak) was Rusted Root
ending and Hot Tuna and the horn man from the final group coming out and
playing ``You can't always get what you want" with two near mind-blowing
solos by Jorma and Jack.  This is the defining rendition of that great
party song.
	
Then, eat your heart out Mike Barno (although, despite my date's insistence
and karma-prayers, they did not play ``Fire on the Mountain"), came The
Other Ones on the final stop of their 22 gig tour.  4 ex-Dead members and 4
people to take Jerry's place (well, one to take one of the Drummer's
place).  They were the best Dead-cover band I ever heard.  In fact, I often
thought they were the Dead in places.  They played a couple of new songs
but mostly Dead favorites and almost never stopped the music.  Very
Dead-like playing around with the end of one song while 2-3 of the members
put in riffs of the song they want to play and then the band agreeing on
the new song and going into it - including one lyrical opening from one
song that started with the old song's rhythm and notes transitioned into
the notes and rhythm of the subsequent.    	The 4 new guys played drums,
guitar, horn and slide guitar.  The horn was a great touch.  One of the
others was a slide guitar - a requirement to fill some of the space Garcia
could play.  I don't know the names of these new dudes, but will be
watching for.   Over 5 hours of music, very short breaks, outdoors on the
grass, lots of space, constant drug partying all around, an attempted sense
of community and sharing ethos.  Just a great excuse for one of my favorite
forms of dancing -Deadrobics!!!
	
Other recent surprise enjoyment was walking into a local club and hearing
the Booker Jones band.  The next day I bought two Booker T and the MGs CDs.
Great keyboardist.  Maybe playing better and with more fun now than back
then.  If these guys come to your town - know who Booker Jones is and go.  

<p>
In response to you and Mike on the lyrics for <i>TAP</i> #205 - I've seen and
have CD's of Koko Taylor and Buddy Guy (4 of his) but never heard her do
``Wang Dang Doodle'' with Buddy Guy.  By the way, Buddy Guy is going to play
this summer with Johnny Lang (who I don't really know except I thought he
was in the ``Alternative" section in the record selections) and Koko Taylor
played locally last night while I was at the Other Ones.  I would say
anything with Willie Dixon on vocals would be well appreciated.  I've heard
the lyrics not only from Koko, but Bob Weir, Marcia Ball, Tommy Castro and
local bands.  Yes, a wonderful raunchy blues beat.  
	
Singles for house dance parties.  There are a lot that come to mind.  My
first thought is something from the Talking Heads <i>Stop Making Sense</i> CD.
<i>((Yeah, I know, that's one of the things I'm pondering.
I did decide that the Heads song I was going to choose HAD to come from
that record.
Good to see you agree.))</i> 
That was a near constant during much of my 80s.  There is so much to choose
from in the House-Techno era.  Here's a one-of-a-kind selection - Strunz
and Farrah - Americas.  The wildest jazz picking of all time.  My Rolling
Stones selection that comes to mind is a song of theirs that I don't like
unless it is at a dance party - and that is ``Midnight Rambler" which has
enough changes and enough raunch to qualify as a ``let's get it on now in
imitation of what we want to do later, i.e., fuck" song as there was at the
time.  Since few people will list such a corny song as ``La Macarena" and I
lived through both reincarnations of popularity for the same song by the
same ``artist" I would like to list that for the near-present and
pre-techno era.  ``Electric slide" for public dance halls.
	
I am trying to get into swing.  Cherry Poppin' Daddies are the only CD I
own with any.  The Brian Setzer Orchestra is coming to town and their new
CD <i>Dirty Boogie</i> (?) has a great track I've heard.  Any advice by anyone
out there for ``contemporary" swing bands.     
<i>((My take so far is that Setzer is doing it the best.
I still don't think they are as good as some of the 70's revivalists or
surely than the originals, but the recording quality is WAY better!))</i>

<p>
Reply to Mark Luedi:  I ditto your comments about Garcia and Grisman's
<i>Shady Grove</i> - quite a loveable CD.  Thanks for all of the, to me, unknown
bands, I will definitely look/listen for some of these.

My dear Jim-Bob -
One man's bold prediction for the identity of the man who will
hold Roger Maris's home run record at the end of this
season:  Roger Maris.  Right now, with McGwire at 44 and
three others at about 40, Maris looks to be in jeopardy, but I
say the odds are he keeps the record.  Now maybe Sammy
Sosa will have another twenty-homer month and make me
look stupid, but I think it's just too hard to keep up that pace
for long.  Maris hit eleven homers in the first three weeks of
August 1961; let's see if any of these guys can keep up with
that pace.  (By the way, all it will probably take to erase Big
Mac's chances is a single trip to the DL.  And he's been
none too durable over the years.)

<center><i>eBenzene</i> - by Mark Lew</center><br>

<p>
The Croatian team's third-place finish in the World Cup gave the television 
stations a chance to remind viewers where that country is. Commentary on 
Croatia was by no means the least intelligent thing spoken in the course of 
World Cup television coverage, and sports announcers can't be expected to 
have a full knowledge of European history and politics. (They can, however, 
be expected to have a good grasp of the game of soccer, which at least one 
of them, Brent Musberger, clearly did not.) Still, two inaccurate labels 
caught my attention.

<p>
First, Croatia was referred to, more than once, as a ``Balkan" nation. 
Unless we are redefining the term (a case one might argue), it is not. 
There are two ways of looking at the term ``Balkan". Geographically, it 
suggests the mountainous Balkan Peninsula. Politically and historically, 
it suggests those European states which broke off from the Ottoman empire. 
Either way, Croatia is decidedly un-Balkan. The former Yugoslavia was a 
large country, uniting Balkan and non-Balkan nations. Serbia and Montenegro 
are certainly Balkan states, and Macedonia is the very heart of the Balkans. 
(It was for control of Macedonian territory that the first Balkan War was 
fought, bringing the term ``Balkan" into our vocabulary.) 

<p>
Both historically and geographically, Croatia and Slovenia are properly 
grouped with Hungary and Austria. Even ``Eastern European" strikes me as 
debatable as a label for Croatia. In Germany they'd call them part of
``mitteleuropa". Here in America we like to divide Europe into two halves, 
in which case Croatia would fall in the eastern half, but it's worth 
mentioning that Zagreb is further west than Vienna.

<p>
Second, in the course of discussing I-forget-what, someone mentioned the 
``ethnic struggle" in the former Yugoslavia. I've said this many times 
before, and I'll continue to say it (and I said it out loud to the TV), 
the conflict between Serbs and Croats is not ethnic, it is cultural. 
Serbs and Croats (and Bosnians) are of the same race. (There are other 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia which are indeed largely ethnic, eg 
between Serbs and Albanians, but he was talking about Croatia.) The Serbs, 
Croats and Bosnians who hate one another make their distinction based 
on religion, which in that part of the world is as much about
culture as it is religious faith. There are many causes of group 
struggle within a nation. The one we're having the most trouble with 
in America right now happens to be race, so we tend to project our 
experience and stick the label ``ethnic" on conflicts we see in other 
countries. Often this is reasonably accurate, sometimes it's not, and 
sometimes it's half true (as in South Africa, where there are both 
interracial and intraracial conflicts).

<p>
In many parts of the world, history unfolded in such a way that group 
identity tended to correspond with blood relation. Modern societies 
which were born out of such a tradition (in particular, nationalism 
as invented by the French) tend to be conscious of differences in race 
and skin color. In other parts of the world, race has traditionally been 
a relatively unimportant factor for group identity. As with most things, 
this is a consequence of geography. A nation born on a land which offers 
more in the way of mobility than fertility will tend to develop a 
society whose economic base is essentially commercial, built on making 
connections between neighboring societies, either through trade or plunder 
(which, economically at least, is a crude form of commerce) or usually 
some combination. Such societies - often nomadic, or at least urban with 
a mobile population - tend to produce insufficient population, and 
thus they encourage immigration (sometimes forcibly). Some examples 
in history are the Islamic empire, the various nomadic empires of the 
Central Asian steppe, and most notably, where the two aforementioned 
come together, the Ottoman Empire.

<p>
National identity is such nations is conspicuously non-ethnic. 
This does not mean that they were open and without prejudice - the Ottomans 
had very strict rules about Greeks, Armenians, and Jews - rather, it means that 
such terms are not defined by race. Thus, if we poke about in history we find 
ethnic surprises at all levels: a Byzantine emperor who turns out to have been an 
Arab, numerous Ottoman rulers were of non-Turkish descent, an Egyptian leader who 
really was black African, and so forth. These examples don't prove that these 
societies were remarkably open to outsiders - the Greek grand viziers were most
certainly insiders - they demonstrate that the definition of ``outsider" 
in these societies had little to do with ethnicity.

<p>
Eastern Europe is not so color-blind as that (especially not in the north), 
but there was still a certain amount of Ottoman-like thinking in the multiracial
Habsburg empire and in Russia. Even the Soviets, with all their internal 
divisions of national republics and provinces, didn't view nationality in 
strictly ethnic terms. (Consider, for example, the Jewish autonomous region.) 
I was reminded of this a few weeks ago, when I was at the Russian Center in 
San Francisco to hear my Russian friend sing. The emcee was a garrulous fellow 
who not only had a lot to say, but got to say it twice, once in Russian and 
once in English.  Somehow he got onto the topic of Pushkin, prompting a 
little nationalist spiel which reminded me a little of the sort of thing 
they used to parody on the old Star Trek with the Chekov character:

<p>
``If Pushkin had been born in America," the emcee said, ``he would never have 
even been allowed to pick up a pen, because - and most Americans don't
realize this - Pushkin was a black man. Most of us Russians know this, 
but we don't think about it much, because we don't care about the color of his skin. 
To us he's not black or white or any color, he's just a Russian." 
Clearly, this was an exaggeration, because even if Pushkin were black, 
in half of the United States at the time he would have been a free man, 
and even in the other half he still might have been allowed to write. 
On the other hand, I couldn't imagine he'd make this up out of absolutely nothing. 
Was Pushkin black? If so, it'd be a surprise that I hadn't heard before.

<p>
When I got home I looked it up, and it turns out that Pushkin was one-eighth black, 
which would indeed be enough to count him as a Negro in the southern
states at the time (early 1800s). Pushkin's great-grandfather was an Abyssinian 
brought to Istanbul as a slave. (And here is a good time to remember that
``slave" does not necessarily connote the wretched condition we associate with 
the term. (American slaves were among the worst-treated in history.) A slave in
Istanbul at this time (about 1700) may or may not be lower class, and might 
very well be more privileged than most of the population. Indeed, at that time
much of the Ottoman government was run by people who technically were slaves.) 
Peter the Great, tsar of Russia, met him there, liked him, bought him, and
brought him back to Russia.

<p>
All this talk of Yugoslavia reminds me of an article about Kosovo I wrote a 
ew months ago for one of the newsgroups.

<p>
I wrote this back in March, in response to a thread on one of the history newsgroups. 
(I think it was soc.history.medieval.) A guy there picked it up and, after
asking my permission, posted it to the ExJugo list, which seems to be populated 
mostly by emigres opposed to Serbian nationalism.

<p>
I really couldn't tell you what's happening in Kosovo now. I don't pay much
attention to international events anymore (and even less to national politics). 
But I do remember some history.

<p>
Setting aside for now the poetic/romantic significance that Serbian literature and 
culture attaches to the battle, the average educated person in America is quite
misinformed about Kosovo. Among the misperceptions (which continue to be 
perpetrated in reference books and news accounts): that the battle was crucial
militarily, enabling the Ottoman Turks to overrun the Balkans; and that the 
Serbian nation was united against the Turks.

<p>
(There is also the notion that the Ottoman Turks invaded Europe from Turkey. 
While strictly accurate, this ignores the fact that the Ottomans were no more
native to the Balkans than they were to Asia Minor, and in fact in its early 
years the empire expanded more quickly in Europe than it did in Asia. By the time
the Ottomans took Constantinople holdings in Europe and in Asia were of roughly 
equal size. And following its defeat in Asia by Timur in 1402, the Ottoman
state was almost entirely European.)

<p>
Kosovo was a mopping-up operation for the Ottomans, and a desperate last-ditch stand 
for the non-Ottoman coalition. The key battle took place 18 years
earlier on the Maritsa (1371) where the bulk of the Serbian army was annihilated. 
At that time a united Serbian force would have had a good chance to defeat
the Ottomans, but the Serbs were hopelessly divided. The heart of Serbia 
was in the south, ruled by Stefan Nemanja's heir Uros (technically still tsar of 
Serbia, I think). Uros was well aware of the Ottoman threat and called on the 
northern nobles to join him in the battle - they were his pledged vassals, after all. 
But these northern nobles, these heroes who would later go down so gloriously at 
Kosovo, were typical barons. They had long been for all practical purposes
independent, and they short-sightedly preferred to promote their own independence 
by abandoning their lord to his fate.

<p>
Most discussion one sees about Kosovo, even educated discussion, presumes the 
existence of a ``Serbia." In fact, there was no united Serbian state.
Occasionally Serbia would be united under a strong leader like Nemanja or Dusan, 
and Serbia did have a national consciousness founded in its church and
literature, but politically Serbia was generally no more united than Germany or Italy. 
Nor was there the sense of the Turks as the ``other" that prevails today.
Both before and after Kosovo, Serbian nobles did not hesitate to pledge suzerainty 
to the Ottomans any time it served their local ambitions. Only a few years
after Kosovo we find Stefan Lazarevic (son of Kosovo's heroic St Lazar) loyally 
serving as vassal to the Ottoman sultan. One might argue that a defeated
prince has little choice but to submit. That's true enough, but it doesn't explain 
why in 1402 Lazarevic would travel all the way to Ankara to fight with Sultan
Bayezid against Timur (Tamerlane). Nor would it explain why Vuk Brankovic, 
the supposed villain of Kosovo, did not submit until years after Lazarevic did.

<p>
This brings us to another point. Besides the obvious pro-Serb bias, the Serb 
national mythology is warped by a strong pro-Lazarevic bias. The epic poems
were written in the court of Lazar's widow Militsa, so naturally Lazar was 
described as a saint. Lazar's former political enemies are all painted as bad guys, 
and Militsa's political rival Brankovic gets the worst treatment of all.
Someone else on this thread mentioned treachery at Kosovo - that comes directly 
from the epics, which tell that Brankovic betrayed the Serbs to the enemy. 
Outside of the epics, evidence of this betrayal is scarce at best, but the poets' 
motive for discrediting Brankovic is clear. Militsa favored her son Stefan as 
heir to Lazar and leader of what remained of the Serbian nation; Stefan's main 
rival for that position was Vuk Brankovic, who had been an ally of Lazar and 
was married to his daughter. Thus her partisans' literary campaign against Brankovic.

<p>
But what really distorts the Serbian epics - and now I'm getting back to the 
true meaning of ``national myth" - is the Christian mysticism. Even more than in
most nations, literature in Serbia was closely tied to the church. 
Serbia had its own independent church, and was blessed with a diligent group of 
monks and scholars (notably including Nemanja's son, St Sava), 
busily transcribing and writing at a pace which is astonishing considering 
the time period (early 13th century). The Serbian church, Serbian state and 
Serbian language were all closely identified. The epic poetry (although oral, 
not written) was born out of this tradition, so Christian symbolism was not 
just a habit but in a sense built into the language. Thus we have Lazar as Christ, 
Vuk Brankovic as Judas, and so forth.

<p>
So the tales of Kosovo are not simple historical accounts, they are spiritual 
stories about the national identity. This is what we mean when we refer to the
``national mythology" of Kosovo. As an example, a key theme in one of the epic cycles: 
On the eve of the battle, Lazar has a dream in which an angel of the
Lord tells him he may have an earthly kingdom or a heavenly kingdom, but not both. 
Lazar chooses to have the heavenly kingdom, and by that choice he is
fated to lose the battle. This story is offers a crucial insight into the 
Serbian national consciousness: as a nation, Serbia believes itself to be blessed 
but doomed.

<p>
<b>Finally, Donald Tucker wrote</b>: 
<font face="symbol"> &lt;&lt; </font
> ... Now try and tell all of this on TV without taking somebody's side! <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
>

<p>
I think a reluctance to ``take somebody's side" is a big part of what's wrong 
with a lot of popular history today. That sort of thinking is what made Robert D
Kaplan's <i>Balkan Ghosts</i> such a disaster. It's a sad fact of our time that 
the history book which was arguably the most influential on U.S. foreign policy 
in the Balkans was written not by a historian but by a journalist. 
Kaplan seems to favor the MacNeill-Lehrer talking-heads approach to history, 
where you line up a bunch of partisans and let them each give their spiel....

<p>
* ``I'll not turn the other cheek if some Albanian plucks out the eyes of a 
fellow Serb, or rapes a little girl, or castrates a 12-year-old Serbian boy...."

<p>
* ``Thank you, Ms Serb ... How do you respond to that, Mr Albanian? 
*Should* she turn the other cheek?..."

<p>
Where's the critical analysis? Where's the basic fact-checking? As a journalist, 
Kaplan no doubt felt it was his job to let all the people tell their own stories, 
but if all the stories are myth, what does it accomplish except to compile a 
pack of insidious lies and publish them in the guise of history?

<p>
The biggest lie about the Balkans is that nationalism is ancient there. 
How many times during the war in Bosnia did we see some talk-show pundit opine, 
``There are age-old hatreds there that one can't even begin to sort out"? 
That's a nice line if you want to look smart on TV but have no time to do 
any research. The only problem is that it's total crap. Nationalism in the 
Balkans is barely 150 years old, and even then it was born only after 
fertilization by the meddling of French and British diplomats.

Take that!!.... those of you who claim Postal Diplomacy is dead.
I think I will actually end up starting two regular Diplomacy
games.
Anyone interested needs to get their money in now and we'll see
where things shake out for next time.
Depending on the final level of interest, I will surely open one
and possibly open a second.
So far, we have Warren Goesle ($15), Drew James, Luke Dwyer, and Steve Emmert for sure and some others have
expressed interest.

<p>
Harry Andruschak would like me to run another variant, like ``1499,
Stonehenge, and maybe you could talk to Brad Wilson about him letting
you run a game of Philadelphia Dip.''
I'm sure I could.
Any other ideas?
I'm inclined to stop here for the moment, until I see how hard things
like Breaking Away are to run.
But, if you don't ask, you won't get....

<p>
On another front, I'd really like this Black Hole game to start too!
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
We also have the Breaking Away game filled and ready to start.
See below.
Rick Desper, Warren Goesle,
David Partridge, John Schultz and the game's designer John Harrington
are interested.
Others??
Last chance!
I'll get this up towards going next time.

2) Note that Roland has changed his E-Mail address.

<p>
3) Although the capitalized centers correspond to the centers you already hold,
it really will represent home centers where you can build.
Frankly, I was rather surprised how few neutrals are left over.
And three of the five were attacked with bounces.
Only two neutrals were not moved upon at all.
Check the SC chart carefully as I am just getting it started.
I thank Harry for his assistance, his chart got me started easily.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Going down, down, and down; 
Burroughs down, down and down, and down; The bunny is bleeding...
Sweat drips like paint; Invites the eye into the crevice; Deep
in its hole the bunny is bleeding.'' some of the lyrics from
``Down'' off of <i>Me</i>, the latest release.

<p>
(JEFF O'DONNELL): When you're Egypt, there is just something awesome
about invading Israel.
Life is good!

<p>
(JONAS-UNCLE JEFFY POOH): Thanks for confronting him for me. The E-Mail he sent
me following was a pleasure to read. 
   
(SPAIN to BOARD): I can't stand it anymore, I'm going to let the world 
know. I'm sorry I am after Tracie Strickler and I think she actually 
likes me. (Grumbling: At least I think she does. I hope she does.) Sorry, 
but I don't want to go out with you, I'm happily going after her and I 
stress her. I really don't like monkeying around, but can you please, 
pretty please, go from homosexual to heterosexual? 
You mind it to be better for all of us and for feeling if you know what I mean. 
I beg of you though, I don't love you like you LOVE me please don't ask me out 
again.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-ERIC BROSIUS): I came across my copy of Jim Svejda's <i>The
Record Shelf Guide to Classical Music</i> 5th Edition (c) 1996.
Jim is a daily announcer at KUSC-FM radio station, has a syndicated music
program titled ``The Record Shelf'', and in his book he has nothing but
praise for Jeno Jando's Beethoven piano sonatas cycle from Naxos.
He also recommends Jando's recording of all Beethoven's Bagatelles.
Given value for money, Jando seems to be your best buy.
<i>((But perhaps not to HIS purpose?
You didn't address the ``tone'' of the interpretations.
It's about time to hear from Eric, I think.
Eric, Eric, what did you do??))</i>

<p>
(M.&nbsp;BARNO to J.&nbsp;BURGESS): The reference in #205 was to the TV series
<i>Highlander</i>.
The deal is, there's these immortals, see, not traditional vampires
but still feeding off the life energy of others; only other immortals,
though.
``There can be only One!'' (immortal), for some Sword-in-the-Stone reason,
and so they have to run around lopping other immortals' heads off with
various longswords.
(Shooting them doesn't work; they recover and you have to behead them and 
absorb the energy-zap they give off at death.
They never mention the sphincters relaxing at the same time.)
There's also a race of Watchers who record the swordfights without interfering.
The only reasons for the Watchers' existence are out of context: to record
the shows for the viewers, and as an excuse for conversation that tells the
audience what's going on.
Despite how long this demo derby has been taking place unnoticed by the 
rest of us, as shown by weekly flashbacks to different centuries, 
there's plenty left.
I don't know if they're fertile, since whenever the protagonist takes
one to bed, he has to remove her head thereafter.
(Have you tried this, Paul?)

<p>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to HARRY ANDRUSCHAK): The American Legion is an organization
of Veterans from an army that has won freedom for more people than any army
in history.
My father was a WWII veteran and Legion member who fought under MacArthur
to help liberate the Philippines from the brutality of the Imperialist
Japanese Empire.
Filipino freedom was chiseled out of American blood.
We owe them nothing!
The existing Filipino government allows child pornography, child prostitution,
and pedophilia.
They have to right to show moral indignation over anything.
I am proud my father was in the American Legion.
I would be proud to have any association with any American Legion anytime, anywhere!

<p>
(ITALY-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>BRITAIN): I look at it this way: If the Ohio Duo survive to take me
out, then I will get a swift and merciful death.  If the Ohio Duo are
defeated, then I will merely die a slow and agonizing death later.

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): Thank you for your letters of 14 June and 20 June.
All I can say is that if Spain carries out his threat to explode a
bomb in my kitchen, they will have to start calling me Linoleum Blownapart.
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork, love it, love it, love it....))</i>
(I wonder if forcing Jim Burgess to type and publish such puns as that
counts as GM abuse?)
<i>((Sorry, bucko, I ***love*** bad puns.
You can't make 'em bad enough to abuse me.
You'll have to try harder than that.))</i>

<p>
(BRITAIN-FRANCE): I wish I had known how clever you were when we started. 

<p>
(EGYPT to PALACE OF VERSAILLES): Where do you come off saying Egypt 
refuses to communicate?
I've sent postcards to everyone, who has contacted me!?!?

<p>
(ITA-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>TUR): You walk like an Egyptian (you know, with your arms and hands
extended at right angles, moving back and forth).  That's how you sneak
into the Great Pyramid.

<p>
(EGYPT-ITALY): I assume you're talking Aztec Pyramids!

<p>
(FRANCE-ITALY): Thank you for your phone call of 7 July.
However, if you have not kept our agreement that I be allowed
into Switzerland.... ``May all the pigeons of Rome deposit their 
droppings on your pizzas.''

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA [RE: SWEDEN]): Is this evidence of an immovable
object meeting an irresistable force?

<p>
(BARNO to POLLARD'S GRAND VIZIER): Be diplomats first and foremost; be 
warriors second; but try not to be <i>dead</i> third!

<p>
(AMBASSADOR ATATURK PO-LLARD to THE WESTERN POWERS): Please do not take my
move towards Serbia as an act of war.
It was there, my country had to try!
Perhaps when the Winter comes, I shall hear from more of you.
(The letters were sparse....) 
I look forward to more negotiations.

<p>
(FRANCE-TURKEY): Thank you for your letter received 22 June.
Whilst we can understand your desire to bring back the Ottoman Empire,
we do have one objection.
No, not the castration of boys, since eunuchs were an old tradition in both
Christian and Muslim countries.
BUT, putting a ban on French wines because they contain alcohol will NOT 
be tolerated.
If we have to, we will sail fleets into your harbors.
Even worse, we will send lawyers from the American tobacco companies into your
courts.
If this means war, so be it.

<p>
(ROME-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>ANKARA):  Your Turkish coffee has been accepted.  A fine blend, but
didn't you know that coffee is out and that green tea is in?
 
(A TURKISH ZEALOT to THE WORLD): So many of you wish us to strike
my Islamic brothers!
For now, we turn our cheeks!
Do not anger the people of Islam. 
For War will surely come!

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): Thanks for the boat ride and reassurances and trust 
me since after all this boat may not be LYO where the women are out of 
this world, but the women here the girls are hot they must know that I'm 
the man for their desires.

<p>
(SPAIN-FRANCE): ``You pustulant, hebetudinous, serrate-toothed, ordure-spouting,
mephitic, pestilential Beotian!"

<p>
(FRANCE-SPAIN): Thank you for your postcard of 11 June, postmarked 12 June,
and received 16 June.
I have moved my units as you requested.
I hope we can continue our alliance against Britain.
I am quite content to be the junior partner in our alliance.
However, I am a bit worried at the cost of all those phone calls you place.
How can you afford so many?

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE 2 ROLL THEM): I been wondering what is Viagra and who are 
these prisoners that have been hardened. 
I wonder too why would they want to be hardened in the first place. 
So, to find out, I'm requesting that the Minister of France get me 
some to find out tonight, say around 8:00 p.m in the pool.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): I was amused to read in the newspaper that the
Southern Baptist Convention decreed that the role of a woman in a marriage
is to ``submit graciously to the servant leadership of her husband.''
Awwww.
That's funnier than any Press I could ever write.

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): Did I ever mention that the Portland Trail Blazers, 
last I heard, suck this year. 

<p>
(SPAIN to POLAND): Wie gehts? Long time no hear man.

<p>
(UKRAINE to POLAND): You are a little too close for comfort.
I wish you would wait before you strike.

<p>
(SPAIN to UKRAINE): Want to set up a permanent alliance to eliminate 
certain threats if they happen to be there against us?

<p>
(EGYPT to BOARD): Now that Spain has informed everyone the key to
conquering me, should I surrender?

<p>
(SPAIN to BARNO): I know my nature and since I'm a teen it spells 
G*I*R*L*S and I was grounded from R rated films when I tried to spell 
Conner's last name and to mention this computer I have internet access at 
is at the public library not my good house I mean government housing. 
On top of that who cares for those guilted Scotsmen when Ireland is 
across the Sea. Also Conner never killed his friends, only the cargon 
did and I guess Kitania. 
Also I brought it up due to the fact that that's what we look like. 
We ally, stab and assault. 
Are we heroes? 

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): You know, who on Earth would want to get in this szine? 
I mean, come on we pay 10 dollars then 5 more for insurance then we no 
longer pay that's the good part, but who in their right mind allowed this 
guy to GM. 
He has no sense of style, it's all in black and white.
I mean I want something in green, orange or at least in different colors, and who 
thought this guy knew the rules? 
I mean I bumped into a few 10 year old girls that could run this game better, 
and do you want to know something else? 
When this szine is doing good is because Mrs. Burgess is the one 
that takes over and makes him extremely jealous.
I mean who in their right mind would allow a women to run one of these? 
Who knows, maybe she'll do better and maybe Jim would get some sense of style. 

<p>
(BOOB to BOARD): I think that is his abuse of the GM.
Now he is going to abuse someone else.
I wonder who??
 
(SPAIN to BOARD): I got the general idea what Viagra is. 
Thing is I don't need it, I get up easy enough.
Thank you very much....

<p>
(BOOB to VOYEURS): I should have known....

1) Note that Rick Desper does have some additional addressing updates.
For those of you on the East Coast, I know that mail to Germany (while
more expensive than a first class letter) is faster than mail to the 
West Coast of the US.
I don't really know how fast West Coast mail to Germany is.
I hope this is not too much of a hardship for anyone.
Please communicate with me about issues that you do have.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A HEADQUARTERS MOVE FROM NEW JERSEY
TO GERMANY):  ``We figured it would be nicer to be closer to Amsterdam",
said one official.  This has the unfortunate side-effect of
significantly increasing the cost of snail mail.  C'est la vie.
Brit-Toad: Did holding the three way together involve not responding to my
questions about AraS and GOA? Did it mean you would be taking Aden even after
I handed you Sud? Sorry Terry, I just don't buy it. 

<p>
(BRITAIN-HOLLAND): What exactly was the point of your last E-Mail? If you have
something constructive to say, I am here to listen and act. If you intend to
vent, hire a therapist, don't e-mail me. 

<p>
(BOOB to BRITAIN): You seem to be having that kind of problem with a lot
of people.
So, who needs a therapist??
By the way, I just noticed that you are Britain in both of these games!
I suppose with the differences in orientation it doesn't feel like you're
playing the same country twice, but really, it was just a coincidence!

<p>
(H -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> B):  Attack everyone?  You're setting yourself up for a rather
diffficult endgame.  Also, I don't know why you bother to lie to me
when the lie has no chance of affecting my orders, and can only serve
to further undermine your credibility.  In about 4 game years the Duck
is going to clean your clock.   Maybe 3.  

<p>
(BRITAIN-HOLLAND): You started it! Nyah Nyah Nyah!

<p>
(H -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> T):  I do enjoy your press considerably.  However, I wish that you
had taken Aden when it was so open to you.  I'm sure you feel the same
way, though, and regrets are fairly worthless.  

<p>
(H -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> R):  OK, take Con, Baghdad.  But then, since Africa is so
inaccessible, please spare the Toad so we can still hear his press.
And since you will then need a new target, I suggest good ol' Pip.  

<p>
(BRITAIN-TURKEY &amp; CHINA): Um, I think your emeny is north. Why are you taking my
centers?

<p>
(H -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> C):  Maybe you'll be able to weasel some armies into the Indian
peninsula, and meet fleets from Holland and Turkey?  The kids are
still pissed that you killed Kenny, though there is a rumor that he'll
be back for the fall move.

<p>
(H -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> F):  No, really, you should take Malaya.  Hong Kong, too.  You
will need it to move West.  With Japanese strength, I don't see you
moving North anytime soon.  Don't blame me!  

<p>
(H -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font

well as is.

www.timricequoteofthemonth.alt:  "Now if I help you it matters that you

some time to work out what to do, I weighed the whole thing out before I
came to you ... Just don't say I'm damned for all time." - "Damned For
All Time" (Judas, Jesus Christ Superstar)

<p>
(NEWS FLASH FROM THE RUSSIAN WAR DEPARTMENT):  Sources here report a
tragic story coming out Sumatra.  Early this morning, a two-seater
biplane crashed into a cemetary in central Sumatra near the seat of the
Dutch Foreign Service HQ.  Dutch Search &amp; Rescue teams using trained
dogs have recovered over 300 bodies thus far and expect the number to
climb as digging continues into the evening.

<p>
(SEPTUARY COLORS to SMTM):  Starting this month, the Diplomatic Impunity
Scoreboard (DIS) will provide a tongue-in-cheek and absolutely
subjective tally of the cheers and jeers garnered by the previous
month's moves, and by whoever or whatever moves the DIS to desultory
ruminations of dubious entertainment value.  Stay tuned, enjoy, and
remember - there's no dissing the DIS!

<p>
(DIPLOMATIC IMPUNITY SCOREBOARD #1):  Special Just-For-You Show Me The
Dough Inaugural Edition - Better late to the ball than no dance at all,
sez DIS.
  
Britain (-)  DIS still cringing at Brit swing-and-a-miss moves on the
Asian subcontinent.  Voltaire said it best - time to
kill a few admirals to encourage the rest.

<p>
China ( = )  Great Wall becomes Great Sieve, but Mandarin of Heaven
circles the welcome wagons.  DIS wonders, ``What's your
fortune, cookie?"
  
France (+)  Backwater tango-ist kicks out the stops.  Sacre coeur! 
First Le Cup Mondial, now this ... Le Republique Rocks!
  
Holland (-) Corner (power) kick blocked.  Uh-oh, here come those
bloody Limey hooligans.  Time to form up a wall?
  
Japan (+) Japanese Imperial Navy kicks some serious Tsarist naval
butt AND starts Pacific Rim mosey.  Emperor says, ``Ah-so."

<p>
Russia ( = ) Win some, lose some - is your name Judy?  Losing heart
(er, p.art) and seoul to Tokyo Rose, but may bag
a two course turkey dinner.  Trading Peking Duck for Mongolian BBQ? 
Messy, messy, messy.
  
Turkey ( = ) The Empire strikes back.  Sultan to King ``Fast Fingers"
Eddie - ``Buddy, can you spare a dot?"
  
GM (+) The conspiracy is out there, and it's that the GM is
conspiring to commit film criticism.  We got your ``loss
of intimacy" right here, Siskebert.
<i>((No, sorry, that was <b>Godzilla</b>, which WAS funny and good!
It was much better than the Siskebert's of the world (including the
ones who were in it) thought it was.))</i>
  
X-Files (-) DIS really, really bored with inane X-Files press line. 
The truth is out there, but DIS can't HANDLE the truth. 
(Oops, wrong movie.)  Even Scully/Mulder seek HIGHER intelligence.
  
DIS ( = ) Better a slow start than no start.

(MALCONTENT MALLARD to BOOB):  I skipped the ``X-Files" movie based on your
review and opted for the Zorro flick instead.  Now I'm lusting for
Zeta-Jones, and it's YOUR fault.
<i>((Nope, buddy, everything is still your fault, even if us 
Politically Correct types aren't supposed to say so any more!))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to CHINA):  So much for Sino-Russian relations, eh?  Tell me, is
the opposite of inscrutable scrutable?  A simple question of no
consequence ... forget we asked.

<p>
(TSAR to SULTAN): I was the target of choice for all?  Hmm, yes, that
would explain the painted bullseyes painted on me front and rear. 
Luckily, it happens I am spineless, brainless, and heartless, meaning I
am without stabworthy vital organs.  In recent experience, I am always
the target of everyone, everywhere, everytime, and I find that doing
without these vital niceties has become a suitable alternative to
mortality.

<p>
(TSAR to BRIT):  Intertesting move selection last season.  Britannia may
rule the waves, but she has a little to learn about ground combat.

<p>
(RUSSIAN WAR DEPARTMENT, OMSK to DUTCH HQ, SUMATRA):  We think you should
lay off those Amsterdam head shops you've obviously been frequenting, as
you're beginning to frighten children, small furry pets, and various
hooved barnyard dwellers.

<p>
(MOSCOW to TOKYO):  Had enough, or shall I rough you up some more by
throwing additional Russian centers at you?

<p>
(RUSSIA to CHINA):  I doubt you'll forgive my perfidy, but hanging around
with Perfidious Albion can really twist your psyche.  I'm still open to
communication, BTW, and would love to hear something from you.

<p>
(TELEGRAM FROM ODESSA to WHITE RUSSIAN ARMIES, EASTERN FRONT): 
Salutations STOP Spies report development of a Chinese secret weapon
STOP Beware animated cross-dressing peasant girl STOP Code named Mulan
STOP Accompanied by small animated dragon, Mu Shu STOP And a lucky
cricket STOP Consider party armed and extremely dangerous. FULLSTOP

<p>

Net!  Free membership today only with proof of age.  For more

<p>
(MEDITATIONS FOR MISERABLE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAY THAT WAY):  Repeat the
mantra ... I am not an unattractive person, I am downright hideous.  To
bring harmony into my relationships with others, I must realize their
lives are much much better than mine, and that self discovery is
useless, unless I discover I'm somebody else.

<p>
(VICTOR HUGO - L'INVASORS):  ``A stand can be made against invasion by an
army;  no stand can be made against invasion by an idea."

1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is STILL
missing... someone find him!).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
 
(PARIS to GM):  In view of the fact that I haven't heard from Keither this
season, perhaps your
little faut pas wasn't so bad:  it elicited the last squeeks and squeals
from he who evidently
prefers to suffer in silence....
<i>((Or, perhaps he prefers to suffer in public...))</i>

<p>
(KEITH to PAUL):  So you think you can just walk into Rome, do you?  Well,
think again!  It'll cost you Ven.  Or maybe Tyo.  Or maybe I'll just
glare at you.

<p>
(RUSSIA-TURKEY): I have moved to Ukraine for three reasons:

<p>
(1) To move farther away from Turkish home centers;

<p>
(2) To assist you on the front against the nasty EG alliance; and

<p>
(3) To give me a reason to write this press so as not to be thrown
out of the game by the puppetmaster... er, gamemaster.
<i>((No longer a danger, of course - thus, scratch that....))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA): Looks like the end.
Congratulations to the three of them.

<p>
(TURKEY): Warsaw has been declared a ``German safe haven" and ``Teutonic
Reserve."  Turkey is proud to take the lead in the preservation effort
of this endangered species.

<p>
1) My sincere, sincere apologies to Stan Johnson for misplacing his orders.
If you saw my computer room at home..... well, it doesn't look like that
anymore.
I took a day off from work, sorted and filed everything, and on the floor
I found.... Stan's orders and letter.
Mea Culpa, Stan, thanks for playing the game out.

<p><br><p><br>
<center><b>Russian Endgame statement - Eliminated</center><br></b>

<p>
This was a typical standby position.  When I got the call I could see that
it was already down to the question of whether Germany and France would crush
the rest of us or not.  Unfortunately, playing Diplomacy causes myopia, so 
the other players couldn't really see this, and as a result, Austria was 
trying to fight I/R/T instead of joining in with them to stop F/G.
There wasn't much hope of succeeding, but I've always preferred an 
elimination to a sycophantic survival, so I can't complain too much.

<p>
<i>((Eric wrote this a LONG time ago.  
I'll bet he barely remembers.
More comments as you prefer are welcome.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>
<center><b>French Endgame statement - Won!</center><br></b>

<p>
Upon my entry into the game in Fall 1907, I inherited a stable alliance
with Germany.   Harold was pounding his way into Russia;  I was granted some 
small footholds into Jack Garrett's Italy.  
Jack's alliance with Turkey didn't seem to do him much good, because
the Sultan was loath to do much more than sit and watch while I picked and
poked my way into the Italian mainland.  
Had the Turk actively participated in the battle for Italy (i.e., convoyed an
army or two over there), my work might really have been cut out for me.  But
Stan didn't, and my way was unimpeded.
     
Once Italy and Russia were eliminated, I realized that continuing with 
the F/G alliance was leading to a sure F/G/T draw:  
Turkey was left with a stable stalemate line.
     
At the time for The Big Decision, I had spare fleets to jump into
England/Nth sea, while the Lowlands were open for my armies.  
German fleets were holding in the Baltic and in Bothnia.  
The choice between a three way draw or a solo win was....
     
Harold's decision to try to throw the game to Turkey could only help my
cause; each German dot given to the Sultan meant one more removal for the
forces opposing me.  Stan, meanwhile, overconcentrated upon the 
Austrian and Russian theatres.  He might have been
wiser trying to man Pru, Sil, Boh, Adr and Tyr to provide real backing for
the wavering German homeland instead of munching away at the Reich's hinterland.
     
Still and all, Harold and Stan showed character in sticking it out to
the bitter end of this game.  
Thanks to them, and to Boob (of course), for a stimulating tactical opportunity.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FAGT, FGT, and FG draws are rejected and so is the concession
to Germany.
The FAGT and GT sportscar draws are reproposed.
Concessions to Turkey and to the ``Made-Up Mike Barno'' also have 
been submitted.
Please vote with your Summer orders.
Failure to vote vetoes all proposals as usual although, as with all
fun proposals, that last one might just pass on a GM whim if it
doesn't receive any clear no votes.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY-GERMANY THE GERM): Way to show your true virulence last issue with
the press.  What a foul mind you have.  Did your Mother have any kids with
brains who lived?

<p>
(GUEST PRESS, IN THE WORDS OF ISAAC ASIMOV): ``The wires had meanwhile
been spliced, the locks opened, and Dr.&nbsp;Weiss stepped out into the
anarchic world of life that was Earth.
`Anarchy,' he said, laughing a little wildly.
`And it will stay that way.' "
(from <i>Misbegotten Missionary</i>)

<p>
(TURKEY-FRANCE): I fully believe you understand and desire the consequence
of your actions - to give a solo to Germany.  I just want to see you do it.
I will never let you live it down in any zine throughout the (admittedly,
potentially short future) entire remaining history of PBM Dip.  
<i>((Yawn, when will you guys all realize that PBM Dip is not going away?
It's just establishing a new downsized niche.
TurboFreaks can check out the Internet, postal games are still where to
go for relaxed speed on games with GM's that talk to you and have szines
with chat.
Anybody thinking about going Warehouse might as well go to the Internet.))</i>
Did you
read my alter-ego (he was Catholic as a child, could have been Agostini
Cardinal Casaroli - yeah, unknown to you, you don't know how to read the
Peeryster - but his Priest never tried to molest him) Mikey (who did not
die from an explosion in his stomach) Barno.  Mike is back from the land of
forest fires and Yellowstones and here to impart his wisdom into this very
game.  Lord knows one of us could use some.  

<p>
(THE MIKE B WHO REALLY EXISTS AT THE MOMENT to PERSON WRITING ``MIKE B''
AND ``HZ'' PRESS): Awright, knockitoff awreddy!

<p>
(TURKEY-GERMANY): Blarno stone - you don't believe in him?  Jim-Bob made
him up?!?!  That shows how utterly ignorant you are.  Jim Boob couldn't
create his own brother as a con in an early series, much less be clever
enough to figure out how to get his computer to put in different
connections between sending and receiving members of press to con anyone
(well maybe you and that dumbo with the big ears France).  Get real. 
Contact <font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
> employ of Yellowstone.org <font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> and verify Blarno's credentials for
yourself.  Maybe the HOF would reveal it.  Do a little research man.  Find
Don Stafford - he will attest to the Blarno's omnipotence and existence.
<i>((That's Dan, Richard... Dan.
That reminds me of one of the funniest academic stories in my repetoire.
I witnessed this one, so it must be true.
A full professor at Northwestern edits one of the major journals in my
field and publishes special issues of a major Biennial conference that
I help to organize (this is the stuff I deal with him about today), but
back when I was in graduate school, as one of his students, he was a
wimpy little assistant professor.
One of my school's full professors didn't like this guy and his first name
was Dan, so he started ignoring him in the building, when running into him
by the mailboxes or the coffee machine, etc.
Finally, as I happened to be standing there, he FORCED a verbal hello out
of this full professor and the guy (who was and is more than a little bit
of an arrogant jerk) said, ``Hi, Don'' and then walked out of the Secretary's
office back toward his office across our big open rotunda that opened
onto all the offices in the building.
Dan runs after him, all the way across, with his voice echoing around
the building, ``It's Dan, it's Dan, it's Dan...'' while being totally
ignored.
He was soon let go and after moving around a bit, built a pretty
good career, while said full professor is retired and still self-centered.
You decide who got the last laugh.
I think (and I saw this at the time as well) that this was hilarious 
from both perspectives - but also quite sad from both perspectives.))</i>

<p>
(BARNO to ``BLARNO'' AND ``BARNEY''): Your press in issue 203 pretending
to be mine was merely Strange.
The genuine stuff is usually Weird.
There's a difference.

<p>
(TURKEY-GERMANY): I voted for the 4-way just to show you that you are
insincere in desiring the game over.  Your greed is coming to the fore
little piggy, you smell a sweet solo - but remember, since you are up
France's asshole, the sweet you smell is not really the smell the rest of
us in the Dip World will remember.  On your death bed, this too will be
remembered.

<p>
(MIKE B }}} CHARLES J): I've been reading Richard's press for years;
why would I try to get him to write more?

<p>
(TURKEY-THE GENUINE MIKE B): Ah, your hopes that if Harold Z could ``shake
things loose enough for someone to go for a win, resulting in revived
interplayer dynamics, it'll be interesting" just ain't going to happen. 
And it is all my fault for being a terrible negotiator/dipster.  That's why
my HOF rating is so low and I never won a DipCon - only finished top board.
Jeez, you'd think I'd stop butting my head against concrete thinkers.  The
Others were hot, did you see them in the East?

<p>
(BARNO to MAD DOCTOR WEISS): And if I'm gonna say things like that about 
your press, I need to mention that the GM likes vapid, uncreative music
(among other sorts) and is deserving of abuse.
<i>((Now you sound like my wife.... do I need more of that kind of
abuse???))</i>

<p>
1) Remember that the default with leftover NMR insurance is to put it into
a continuing sub until it is gone.
You also can use it toward a new game, e.g. if Michael wants to join a new
game he only needs to send me $8.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BERLIN to PROVIDENCE): Is it too late for me to get a standby to
take this position?
<i>((Yup, you'll have to take full responsibility for this one.
Now someone has to find the original GM, so he can see what happened!!))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): Your suggestion that I tanked
this season in order to ensure MY OWN DEATH is
contemptible.  Consider yourself spat upon.
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork, ptttuuuieeeee!
Admit it.
You wanted that ``all time'' record for most times as Survivor in a 
Win by another Player while playing Germany in one issue of a Single
Dip Szine.
The record may be tied, but I'll assert it will never be broken!!
This is one for the ages.))</i>

<p>
(EMMERT to JAMES): The wages of sin is, apparently, eighteen
dots.  Congratulations, you rat.

<p>
(LAWYER to ``JOKE" TELLER): Amateur.  Any time you want original
lawyer jokes, let me know.  In fact, I'll give you one right now.

<p>
Death approached the old miser steadily.  When he saw it
coming, he summoned his three most trusted friends to his
bedside:  His doctor, his lawyer, and his minister.  They
came to his hospital room, and closed the door.
``I know there's not much longer for me," the patient began,
weakly.  ``That's right," his doctor spoke quietly, ``we've done
all we can, but it's just a matter of time."
``Well, I can deal with my own mortality.  But I can't stand the
idea of those damn kids of mine blowing all my money!"  The
man's voice grew stronger with his emotion.  ``They're so
irresponsible, they'll just blow everything I worked for all my
life!"  He slumped back onto his pillow.  ``What I really want
is to be buried with my money."
The lawyer spoke up.  ``But I've already told you, the law
won't enforce a term in your will like that."
The man smiled and said, ``I have something else in mind." 
He reached over to a bedside table, and picked up three
envelopes.  ``I've had everything I own sold and converted to
cash," he said, with an effort, ``and it's in these three
envelopes.  There's ten million dollars in each one, thirty
million in all!"  He handed the envelopes to the men, and
continued, ``I want you to come to my funeral when I'm gone,
and before they close my grave, I want you to throw this
money into my grave.  I want you to swear!"
Exhausted with the effort of speaking, he collapsed back on
the pillow.  The three visitors were taken aback by this
unusual request, but their respect for their dying friend led
each man to promise to do what was asked of him.

<p>
The patient did not last the night.  Two days later, at the
conclusion of the funeral, three envelopes were silently
tossed into the freshly-dug grave.

<p>
Two weeks later, the three men met by chance on a street
corner.  The minister said, ``I am so relieved to see you. 
There is something gnawing at my conscience that I simply
must tell someone, and you are the logical ones to tell."  The
doctor and lawyer waited for his explanation while the
minister summoned the courage to speak.  When he began,
his voice cracked:  ``I must confess to a terrible sin.  You
see, the orphanage was critically short of funds, and they
were looking at the very real possibility of having to
shortchange the kids on milk and blankets, or having to turn
them away.  I just couldn't bear that, so I -" he paused, and
after a moment, said, ``I took $65,000 from the envelope and
gave it to the orphanage, and threw the rest into the grave." 
When he stopped speaking, the lawyer's eyebrow arched,
and the doctor sighed.
``I know just how you feel," the doctor began, ``for I, too,
succumbed to just that temptation."  The doctor spoke
quickly, in a hushed tone, seemingly wanting to keep even
the paving stones from hearing his confession.  ``In my case,
fundraising for the new burn unit at the children's hospital had
completely dried up, and the contractor was threatening to
stop work if he didn't get paid.  I just couldn't bear to see
that, so I took $225,000 from the envelope and gave it to the
contractor.  I threw the rest of the money in."  
When he stopped speaking, there was a pause, where the
three men were silent, the minister and doctor able to look
only at the tops of their shoes.
The lawyer then spoke, and his tone was shrill and
accusatory.  ``I cannot believe you two!"  The other men
cringed visibly at the harshness in his voice.  ``You are this
man's trusted friends, and you make a solemn promise to a
dying man, then as soon as he's gone, you take his money
for your own purposes!  If he wanted to give money to the
orphanage or the hospital, he would have said so, but
basically you just stole his money!"  The last three words
were spat out, and stung the two men terribly.  ``Why, you're
nothing but THIEVES!"
After a moment, the lawyer continued, in a lower volume but
with no less haughtiness, ``As for my own solemn promise, I
kept it, unlike you.  When I threw my envelope in the grave,
my personal check for the entire ten million dollars was
inside."

<p>
Now, THAT, my boy, is a lawyer joke.
