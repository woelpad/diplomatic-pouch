Jim,

Please use this press instead of what I previously sent.  No change to the
orders.

Thanks,

Drew

England to France:  The silence is deafening.  Sorry, but we had no choice.
I assume we will be bouncing this season.  

Syracuse to World:  College basketball season has started at last and
football is finally over (at least for bad teams like SU).  My last and only
comment on football is that Rutgers is now SU and SU is now Rutgers.

Backfire to Base:  Manuevers Acceptable

Got it, I'm a bit late with this issue, so I'm going to slip this in,
and let you know that you have until Dec. 2 to change them if you want.
