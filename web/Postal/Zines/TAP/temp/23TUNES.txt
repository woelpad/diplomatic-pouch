%\noindent Here are your guesses and comments (also alphabetical order):
%
%Rick Desper: Since you wrote comments for all the picks, 
%that means you are faking comments?
%{\it ((Yessiree, I did it really well the first time, didn't I?
%This time I fell down a little.))}
%Well, I have no freakin' idea who picked what.  Half the players I don't know at
%all.  And by ``half" I mean ``everybody but you and Emmert".  
%I'll say Emmert picked \#1 (NO) and you picked \#3 (YES).
%{\it ((You score one point, as a mathematician like you should know, 
%you CAN earn points here for guessing.))}
%For an off-game bonus, do you know Ricky Gervais?

%It's for charity. :)
%{\it ((Of course, but I am not a huge fan.
%I think both the original and American versions are OK, and there
%is something about the women playing the secretaries in both ``Offices"
%that you can't take your eyes off, but no, I'm not a big fan.))}

%Richard Smith: Guesses:
%1. Brendan Whyte  (YES);
%2. Brad Wilson (NO);
%3. Jim-Bob Burgess (YES);
%4. Rick Desper (NO);
%5. Richard Smith (THAT'S YOU no pts.);
%6. Doug Kent  (NO);
%7. Steve Emmert (NO);
%8. Dick Martin  (YES).
%{\it ((That gives you three points. 
%Not bad for joining the szine right now to play.))}

%Brad Wilson: I must have missed the part about themes, because Lord
%knows I didn't have one.
%Anyway, my guesses (and theme guess if any):
%1) Whyte - choral singing (YES, no real theme, though you're right they were choral);
%2) Kent  (YES);
%3) you   (YES);
%4) Smith  (NO);
%5) Desper  (NO);
%6) Emmert  (NO);
%8) Dick Martin  (YES).
%I'll be damned if I get any other ``themes". I'm kinda
%dense these days.

%You're way ahead with NTR's.))}

%That's it, I've been lurking long enough... here's the 
%first batch of tunes for a game light enough and fitting 
%one of my&nbsp;major interests perefctly. My theme 
%this time is, obviously, Germany.<BR>

%4) Das Ich -- Keimzeit:
%Weirdest looking act I've ever seen. 
%I've got mental picture of these guys fetching their children from daycare... 
%I'd bet they would would have to go home empty handed most of times.
%{\it ((OK, I knew it would happen, we would hit a song I just don't know.
%So you know this isn't me.))}

%5) Einst\"urzende Neubauten -- Seele Brennt:
%Usually delivering interesting soundscapes though sometimes being more silly than challenging.
%{\it ((I actually do know this song, I like it, a bit cutesy, but a bit more interesting
%than you indicate, compares favorably to the masters of soundscape, Stereolab.))}

%German electronic medieval music anyone?<BR>

%Richard Smith <richard of sholing.force9.co.uk>
%I've got 20-odd tracks in mind, mostly from this year though they won't fit
%on a single CD - will have to be a double :-) I've picked my first three
%from near the bottom of the list...
%MYSTERY PERSON \#5 for TURN 1
%MYSTERY PERSON \#2 for TURN 2:
%1) Pure Reason Revolution -- The Bright Ambassadors of Morning:
%So, you're a promising new pop band with a (currently) trendy retro-rock
%stylee. You've just been signed to Sony-BMG, one of the biggest labels in
%the world. It's single time. You choose to go for a 12-minute epic
%masterpiece. Music biz suicide? No! Everyone loves it.
%{\it ((And worthy successors to Pink Floyd, Genesis, and other bands who did it
%before them.
%There's nothing wrong with 12 minutes.))}
%
%2) Mastodon -- Siberian Divide:
%One of America's up and coming metal bands, Mastodon have gone a bit arty
%with their ``Blood Mountain" album to great effect. It's hard to pick a best
%track, but this is my favorite.
%{\it ((Metal seems to be making a comeback, in new and interesting ``arty'' ways.))}
%
%3) Wolverine -- Liar on the Mount:
%This track is from the Swedish prog-mettalers' 2006 album ``Still". It
%features spoken passages from none other than Mr. George W. Bush. How dare
%they lambast the leader of the free world! Oh well why not, everyone else
%does and the track is really good. Oddly, the first time I heard this track,
%the tone of Dubya's voice reminded me of the guy on Mylo's ``Destroy Rock and
%Roll" who rattles off a list of musical artists that are ``evil", including
%David Boowie and Cindy Looper.
%{\it ((No, say it ain't so?
%W.??
%The real question about lies is the relationship between lies and propaganda.
%If no one calls you on it -- not really -- is it a lie or just spin?))}

%4) Rammstein -- Links 234 (Live):
%German heavy metal band Rammstein are without doubt one of the best live 
%acts in the world. This track is from the Volkerball DVD which features 
%them in all their glory -- pyrotechnics, costumes, blood, sado-masochism, 
%and most of all arsch-kicking rock 'n' roll. They have been accused of 
%many things including homoerotic symbolism and being Nazis. My chosen 
%track is about their repudiation of the latter. The words contain ``we 
%sound right but we think left" whilst the music (deliberately) sounds a 
%bit ``zieg heil". Works for me, whenever I listen to it I have a strange 
%urge to annex my next-door neighbors :-) 
%{\it ((Ah, heck, everyone's going to know this isn't me either.
%I really like the next song, but this one leaves me cold, maybe I do need
%to hear it live.
%I do find your note about the lyrics intriguing.))}

5) Porcupine Tree -- Hatesong (Live):
British art-rock quartet Porcupine Tree have been getting increasingly
popular in America following two successful albums ``In Absentia" and 
``Deadwing". This track is from the ``Arriving Somewhere" DVD filmed in 
Chicago last year. Wow, awesome gig! The track I've chosen is ``Hatesong" 
which is one of the highlights of the show with a total wig-out guitar 
solo and fantastic drumming. I can't get enough of these guys, they make 
other bands look like bumbling amateurs!
{\it ((Damned straight.
To me, much of the last five or six years has been low on invention and
sincere energy, but NOT from these guys, possibly the best band around
right now who is not the Mekons.... ;-)  ))}

Hi Jim-Bob,

My TAP arrived today and I've given it and your ever-expanding entourage of 
subzines a good old read. As the 23 Tunes is held over - here's my 
submission again (a slight edit to remove a couple of giveaway UK 
spellings).

Richard

P.S. I still can't work out what the deadline is. The zine is dated 19th 
Feb. I had a quick scan of the leccy version on 3rd March and got my paper 
copy on 17th March....?

>>>23 Tunes<<<

Here's my guesses for this round:

1. Steve Emmert
2. Richard Smith
3. Brendan Whyte
4. Brad Wilson
5. Rick Desper
6. Jim-Bob Burgess
[Doug Kent, Dick Martin NTR]

..and the next instalment of choons...

Tortoise - Gamera

One of the top instrumental bands of recent years, Chicago-based Tortoise
defy an exact categorization - a bit post-rock, a bit jazz, and lots of
other styles too. The track I've chosen is a long piece from their Lazarus
Taxon boxed set. It opens with a gentle guitar melody but then really starts
to motor with a lively drum beat and a simple driving synth riff keeping you
happy for the next 10 minutes of your life.

Saracen - Mary

Famous for the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse song in the 80s, Saracen made
a comeback in 2003 with the album Red Sky, and now they've topped the lot
with a ridiculous Spinal Tapesque concept album about the Da Vinci Code,
called Vox in Excelso. This was started long before Dan Brown wrote his
book, so they can't be accused of cashing in. The songs are served up with
gusto in an old-fashioned hard-rock style, interspersed with cheesy
narratives. Once you've stopped laughing you realize how much you enjoyed
the album and give it another spin.

%"Wilson, Bradley" <BWilson of Phillyburbs.com>
%MYSTERY PERSON \#7 for Turn 1
MYSTERY PERSON \#3 for TURN 2:
%1) Mem Shannon, ``Taxicab Driver" (from ``A Cab Driver's Blues", Hannibal/Rykodisc, 
%1995): Blues is not necessarily a native New Orleans form of music: 
%the blues' roots in the Mississippi Delta took it north to Memphis, Kansas City 
%and (most of all) Chicago. But take gritty urban blues, the swampy, funky 
%second-line rhythm that fuels New Orleans music and a sharp wit typical of 
%New Orleans, and the result is a song like this: 
%funny, foot-tapping and utterly charming. Shannon's expressive voice 
%and distinctive guitar sound (Albert Collins meets Wes Montgomery) 
%make this one a treat.
%{\it ((Many people think that this sort of music all sounds the same, they're
%completely nuts.
%The range of potential emotions is immense and fundamentally isn't music about
%emotion.
%It's just emotion.... or is that the motion.
%Sorry, can't resist a Ghod reference.))}
%
%2) The Kinks, ``Catch Me Now I'm Falling" (from ``One from the Road", 
%recorded 1979, released 1980, Konk Records): I always thought the 
%Kinks rocked harder and wrote sharper lyrics than the (to me) 
%overrated Beatles, and here's the proof. This whole live album 
%glistens and sizzles with intensity and passion, and the band never 
%sounded tighter. The song is that rare bird, a political song from 
%the late 1970's still sadly relevant; its ferocious lyrics sum 
%up Jimmy Carter-malaise era U.S.A. well, and they are just as apt 
%today for the running disaster that is Bushism. 
%Dave Davies never sounded better on lead guitar than here.
%{\it ((I know there are Beatles fans of this generation -- resident {\it TAP}pites
%Keith Sherwood and Peter Sullivan most definitely included -- but a lot of people
%didn't remember that the Kinks were making relevant music in the Elvis Costello
%era.))}
%
%3) Eartha Kitt, ``Let's Do It" (from ``Eartha Kitt Purr-fect Greatest Hits, 
%7N Records, 1998; recorded 5 October 1953, with Henri Rene \& 
%His Orchestra): Cole Porter, that old sybarite and matchless wit, 
%must have loved this: the ever-slinky Miss Kitt turning a Porter 
%tune about falling in love into something else entirely -- let's 
%just say Kitt's throaty delivery and arch-seductive voice obviously take
%the ``it" of the title to mean somnething more, er, basic. 
%This snappy, hot little number is a textbook case of how to take a 
%standard and make it your own. Kitt -- now on Broadway in ``Mimi le Duck" -- 
%is a force of nature, a dazzling entertainer with an utterly 
%distinctive voice and great legs for a lady in her 70's.
%Her 50's recordings are as sexy and dangerous as anything Elvis ever did.
%{\it ((And she even played Catwoman on Batman, who can forget that???
%And I just noticed after checking that she shortly turns 79, so she's
%almost OUT of her 70's.
%Lastly, she once played Helen of Troy in the Orson Welles production of
%{\it Dr. Faust}, it was Welles who saw that her magnetic personality made
%her an actress, not just a singer/dancer.))}
%Brad Wilson <bwdolphin146@yahoo.com>

4) ``April in Paris", Count Basie and His Orchestra
(Verve, recorded 1955, released 1956): Like listening
to liquid chocolate, so velvety and creamy and rich.
The post-war Basie band at its absolute swinging,
so-tight-it's-loose peak. Thad Jones never sounded
better on trumpet. Sizzling arrangement. The best
dance music ever written.
{\it ((I honestly don't get why this music isn't 
heard more.
I like some headbanging as much as the next bloke, 
but sometimes you want to glide around the dance floor,
well at least dream about gliding around the dance floor
to the likes of this.))} 

5) ``The Goodbye Look", Donald Fagen (from ``The
Nightfly", Warner Brothers, 1982): A nasty little gem,
overshadowed on this LP by the title track and the
bouncy ``I.G.Y.", but still a classic piece of cynicism
and detachment from half of the grandly bitter duo
known as Steely Dan. Set in somewhere south of Key
West, Fagen's troubled resort is anything but
Margaritaville. Anyone who likes Steely Dan should
have Fagen's solo discs.
{\it ((Go listen to Steely Dan again, you might have pooh-poohed it
in 1978, pledging your allegiance to Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson, 
but you would be wrong.
It's interesting how this post-Steely Dan material garnered such
little attention.))}

%From: Rick Desper <rick_desper of yahoo.com>
%MYSTERY PERSON \#6: in Turn 1
%It would be pretty easy to "play to win" by repeatedly picking completely obscure songs that have %no relationship to each other (or me), but that seems boring.  So here's my first trio:
%The connection is obvious to me.  Is it to you?
%Well, this is a hint:
%http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/
MYSTERY PERSON \#4 for TURN 2:
%1) ``Baker Street'' by Gerry Rafferty:
%I have always liked ``Baker Street", which has one of the most 
%famous sax riffs in pop music.  
%It was big on MTV in the early 80s when videos were young.
%{\it ((Yes, indeed, and I am a huge sax fan, at that time, I was much more of a Saxa
%fan with the English Beat, but this one is more famous than Saxa's on, say,
%``Mirror in the Bathroom".))}
%
%2) Waterloo by Abba:
%``Waterloo" is one of the ABBA songs that was {\it not} on my Dad's ABBA 
%8-track tape that he'd play in the car in the 70s.  
%His collection consisted of one 8-track apiece from ABBA, John Denver, The Beach 
%Boys, and Helen Reddy.  That was it, I think.  After having that beaten into 
%my head for about five years I developed a bit of an antipathy to the group, 
%but that's faded in recent years.  When I moved to {\it ((place name 
%censored since it might give away who this is))} I rediscovered 
%the group, since they were still big in the dance clubs in a retro way.  
%Of course ``Dancing Queen" was the big hit.  Didn't hear ``Waterloo" 
%until I saw ``Muriel's Wedding", the film that inspired the musical 
%``Mamma Mia".  Both are filled with ABBA tunes.  
%{\it ((My dad really did have this 8-track collection
%you'll have to figure out if that means this is my list
%or that my father and this person's father had the same 8-track tape taste.
%And ``Muriel's Wedding'' and ``Mamma Mia" are both worthy vehicles for this
%infectious music!!))}
%
%3) Angel by Sarah McLachlan:
%The Bakerloo tube line is named after the Baker Street and Waterloo stations.  
%My commute every day goes through the former station (I'm traveling from 
%that "Mornington Crescent" is also the name of a song.  
%``Angel" has been the title of a number of songs.  
%I picked the Sarah McLachlan song after listening to a few since it sounded nice.  
%{\it ((I also like the P.P. Arnold version of ``Angel of the Morning", but that's
%more than just Angel -- there is a theme in this one, in case you can't tell....
%and I think Sarah is just that ``nice''.
%I'll bet she's nice and down to earth in person too.))}

4) ``Mad World" performed by Gary Jules for the Donnie Darko sound
track, covering a Tears for Fears song.
Donnie Darko is a great film and this tune really captures 
its spirit of confusion and pain.  
Also, one of the more inventive SF films of recent years.
{\it ((I don't know why this film was so overlooked.
I pretty much watch EVERY SF film that comes down the pike, so I can't
easily tell, but this one seemed to be overlooked.))}

5) ``Praise you" by Fatboy Slim.  The video is priceless.
{\it ((Nuff said.
There is no more.
I still think in many ways the ``first video'' (``Video Killed the Radio Star"
by the Buggles is the best, but this really IS the best video ever.))} 

\medskip

%Dick Martin <phantom2 of speakeasy.net>
%MYSTERY PERSON \#8: in TURN 1
MYSTERY PERSON \#5 in TURN 2:

%1) ``Want-Ad Blues", John Lee Hooker: Sure, there are better-known 
%Hooker tunes, like ``Boom Boom" and the classic ``Boogie Chillun", but 
%this is the one I keep coming back to.  Maybe it's the slyly suggestive 
%lyrics sung in Hooker's gravelly voice that's always just around but 
%not quite on the beat that creates the magnetic tension.  Maybe it's the 
%groove so deep ``even a white person could get it".  Whatever.  It's easy 
%to listen to and hard to sit still for.
%{\it ((Yes, yes, yes, this music seems so simple, but is so complex....))}
%
%2) ``Sing, Sing, Sing", Benny Goodman:  I hadn't heard this tune for ages 
%til I heard Los Straitjackets play it in concert a couple years back. 
%they ripped into it as a surf guitar instrumental and I kept thinking 
%to myself, ``I know this song, I know this song...what is it???" then it 
%clicked and I was blown away.  It's still as amazingly hot today as it 
%was back in the big band days.  Gotta go back to the source and pick the 
%original for being so timeless, even though the live Los Straitjackets 
%version is about as good.
%{\it ((I think all of us were not actually alive when Benny Goodman
%originally recorded this, or if we were, we weren't really old enough
%to pay attention.
%It's scary how good and fresh some of that music sounds today in our
%world of retreads and recycles.
%Cab Calloway is another of the band leaders who made music that sounds
%wonderful and amazingly hot today.
%for Cab, I recommend the ``Are You Hep to the Jive?'' CD compilation that
%came out a decade ago or so.))}
%
%3) ``Blue on a Green Planet", Big Country:  Anthems...nobody does 
%anthemic guitar rock as well as Big Country.  Big, loud, wailing guitar 
%sounds.  Lyrics that sorta make sense if you don't think about them too 
%deeply.  Drench with heartfelt emotion.  Crank it up to 11.  Repeat.
%{\it ((No one has the big sound down better than these guys.
%If you've only heard their eponymous ``In a Big Country", the Country is
%big enough to hold some other great anthems as well.
%Big Country has a conscience too.))}

4) ``Instrumental Introduction/Don't Look Down", Lindsey Buckingham: The 
first time I heard this I just kinda shrugged and said, ``eh". Second 
time I thought it maybe wasn't such a weak song after all. Third 
time...I couldn't take it out of the CD player for a month. It's 
beautifully played pop music that is just off-center enough to stay 
fresh no matter how often it's played.
{\it ((I used to like skating to this song a huge amount.  I'm not
sure why, not sure if it ever has been used by a major figure skater,
but they should think about it.))}

5) ``Sweet Marie" (live), Hothouse Flowers:  This is about as close as it 
gets to putting pure emotion into song. It's a gospelly breakup song, 
sung to the girl that's just left him.  He's still in love, but knows 
that it's not going to work.  Mildly irrational, sweetly romantic, 
wishing the best for the woman he loves but can't have.  Time to just 
carry on and savor the feelings because they're all you have left.  I've 
been there.
{\it ((This is another band that is really cool live, and if you've
not heard this song live, go take a listen.))}

%6. "brand new cadillac", the clash. the second song on the greatest 
%album of all time, the only band that matters covers an old rockabilly 
%song and makes it all their own. propulsively danceable, rocking hard 
%from start to finish. yeah, his girl has left him and ain't never 
%coming back...but he still can't help but be impressed by the caddy.
%
%7. "in my life", the beatles. a whole lifetime's love song compressed 
%into less than two and a half minutes. sentimental without being sappy, 
%simple, earnest, honest, concise and with room to spare for a piano 
%solo. they don't make them like this anymore.
%
%8. "the real me", the who. for a band that spent a great deal of time 
%obsessing on identity issues, it doesn't get any more basic than this. 
%hmmm...is he daring us to consider him, or pleading? either way, it 
%looks bleak - just like the rest of the brilliant quadrophenia. and 
%with entwistle's agile bass, "the best keith moon style drummer on the 
%planet" and townsend's power chords playing against each other as much 
%as with each other, form matches content perfectly.
%
%9. "rev. jack and his roamin' cadillac church", by timbuk3. ok, so i'm 
%a sucker for the big guitar playing the big groove. add a dash of wry, 
%dry humor, a galloping drum machine, some wailing harp and barbara k's 
%sublime harmony vocals and it's a tasty treat. too bad nobody ever 
%heard this song because it's not on the cd with their "only" song. eden 
%alley is a very strong cd throughout, and well worth a listen if you 
%can still find a copy.
ugh! my how time flies!
only have a minute to dash off quick guesses here. hmmm....
i'm guessing that #7 is brad, #8 is me (with the theme being great 
guitar music?), #1 could be emmert. emmert also could be #4 (can i 
guess him twice?). i will guess you as #3. the rest...no clue. pick 
desper as #5, kent as #2, smith as #6 and whyte as #4 if i can't guess 
emmert twice.
the theme for #3 is psychedelia, #5 is metal, #6 is pure pop, #7 is 
distinctive vocals, and #8 is great guitars (even though i pick the 
benny goodman version of sing sing sing i spend most of my time talking 
bout los straitjackets version)
hope that's not too late!
are you arranging the songs by theme or should we try to do that?

%ME
%MYSTERY PERSON \#3 for TURN 1
MYSTERY PERSON \#6 in TURN 2:

%1) ``White Rhino Tea" by the Ozric Tentacles: Starting this off slow with
%an instrumental by this jazzy space rock band from 1991.  Six minutes of
%dreamy, haunting sonic tapestry, and the first cut off of what I think is their best
%album, {\it Strangeitude}.
%{\it ((Most of the progressive rock like this which I like is much earlier
%than this, Bob Olsen and I, for example, are huge Klaus Schulze fans, but
%the Tentacles fit well into this genre and are worthy successors.))}
%
%2) ``The Secret of Bethany's Mouth" by the Green Pajamas: This psych pop
%masterpiece is the latest from this veteran group, 
%from the 2005 release {\it 21st Century Seance} that naturally is about
%various kinds of ghost stories, following up on the theme.
%Green Pajamas remain possibly the best of the many bands continuing to plumb the 
%new psychedelia.
%This song has as its main inspiration the romantic mystery novel
%``Pale as the Dead'' by Fiona Mountain and as a folky feel to it.
%{\it ((Since Eric Ozog isn't in the game (at least so far) I can tell you
%that this is Eric's favorite band and they hail, naturally, from Seattle.))}
%
%3) ``The Pictures on My Wall'' by Echo and the Bunnymen: 1979 beginning of the 
%McCulloch boys is fresh and exciting when heard today.
%There is even a hint of Joy Division-ness in them on this cut.
%This first single was unavailable anywhere I knew about until the mid-1990's,
%since the early vinyl printing was small.
%{\it ((I was happy to see someone select this song, not many people have ever
%heard it, but to us Bunnymen fans this is an essential pickup.))}

4) ``Muddy Waters" from Pere Ubu: This is off the 1998 {\it Pennsylvania} CD.
The record as a whole is quite frankly still way ahead of its time, nearly ten
years after it was recorded.
There isn't anything quite yet like David Thomas and Pere Ubu even now.
This track is unlike the other tracks on the album, but heck you could say
that about almost every track.
I'd not listened to this in some time, and it was immensely rewarding to hear it
again.
As far as this track goes, well, it doesn't sound like Muddy, not really anyway,
but Muddy is part of the inspiration that underlies the work here.
Reminds me in many ways of Zappa as it salutes Muddy without imitating him.
{\it ((This tune is the middle point of the album (7th track), the best two other songs are ``Woolie
Bullie'' that leads off the CD and ``Wheelhouse" which ends the disc as the 15th
track. 
Great choice, this is a much overlooked CD, it was reissued last year as I believe
the original label for it folded.))}

5) ``Girls and Boys'' from Blur (pet shop boys mix): The two pet shop boys mixes
on the single are both much better than the base song (one of them is four minutes,
ther other over seven) of this classic 1994 anthem.
It anticipates the metrosexual movement (theme here is songs ahead of their times)
with the deliciously ambiguous ``Girls who are boys,
Who like boys to be girls, Who do boys like they're girls,
Who do girls like they're boys,
Always should be someone you really love!''
{\it (({\bf TAP} has always been a Blur over Oasis szine, and this was one
of the heights of the Blur movement.
If you have to ask who Blur and Oasis were, then of course this isn't going
to make any sense even were I to explain it to you.
Pop music debates are kinda like that, aren't they???))}

%Brendan Whyte <bwhyte of mscc.huji.ac.il>
%MYSTERY PERSON \#1 from Turn 1 NTR for Turn 2
%
%1) The ``Hallelujah" Chorus from Handel's ``Messiah":
%The title tells you what the words are, and the middle few bars are 
%so famous, but how many people, apart from those that sing it, know 
%the whole movement? A great little number this, boppy and exciting to 
%sing, to sing along to, or just to tap ones fingers to on the 
%steering wheel while caught in traffic, though with the new bridge to 
%replace the Woodrow Wilson drawbridge in DC should ease the latter at least.
%{\it ((As I've said before, I most prefer the John Eliot Gardner version
%(Philips R 215049, 1983) with the light clarity of tone that I'm trying
%to develop right now in my own singing.
%John Eliot Gardner's recording with the Monteverdi Choir of the 
%Dixit Dominus by Handel (Erato, 1992) is even better to illustrate this point.))}
%
%2) ``Libera Me" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Requiem":
%The final movement of this impressive modernist-classical piece 
%leaves the boy soprano on his own to hold pitch and rhythm singing 
%about eternal peace, when the organ comes crashing in over him with 
%dissonance and gusto trying to drown him out in chaos, but its waves 
%of noise break and underneath the sweet high ``perpertua" carries on. 
%It's a brave young lad who can maintain that, especially in any live 
%performance in front of an audience. But live or recorded, this is 
%great music and a fascinating musical analogy of peace and goodness 
%and light triumphing over noise and chaos.
%{\it ((I've heard about five attempts in recent years to compose a Requiem,
%quite a difficult task to do.
%Even as I quibble with A.L. Webber on many points in how he composes his
%other more popular music, this is easily the best of those Requiems.
%And no, I'm not even counting Paul McCartney's Ecce Com Meum composition.))}

%3) ``Mau Kamu Suka Kamu" by Rano Karno:
%An interesting delve into singing by TV presenter Karno comes up 
%trumps with this sugary but fun silly love song in a disco-dangdut 
%style (one could never call Karno himself `dangdut', he's too 
%respectable!). Mothers and daughters will sing along in the catchy 
%chorus. A difficult track to find outside Java, but worth the effort 
%of hunting down, especially to see the expression on the faces of 
%expat Indonesians when you play it!
%{\it ((I have a strange soft spot for silly love songs, you know.....))}

spangberg, , smith, desper, martin,wilson.

my 4 to get back in:

Je suis un rock star", Bill Wyman.
Wyman is not a rock star, more of a backup session musician for Mick Jagger, 
and he proves it on this album by still not relaising his inability to sing. 
But the album's title track is still a great Lolita standard... a pity the 
hovercraft is no more. Si si!

"Some girls", Racey.
Ah, clean cut goodlooking boys rocking away in a family way and ignoring 
those annoying punks down the road who had had too much media attention. 
What better way to get the family bopping in the late 70s?

"I've got a brand new combine harvester", the Wurzels.
When does a parody overtake its victim for sheer fun? When it's a Scrumpy 
and western track by the Wurzels. I can't wait to get my hands on her acres 
either! Corduroy pants all round.

"Grab this Thing", Sounds Incorporated.
A fantastic live act, and no less stunning on vinyl, but they never sold 
enough records... one fials to understand why when listening to them now, a 
sax-dominated drum-reinforced stomper of a track. Damn but that Ton Newman 
could play them skins!

%MYSTERY PERSON \#2 in Turn 1, NTR in Turn 2 
%
%1) ``Haunted'' by Poe: An honorable attempt to deal with her
%father's death.  Really the whole album is.
%{\it ((You all know how much I grew up on complex layers of sound and
%this 2000 release was the best of that genre in that year by far.))}
%
%2) ``Can You Do It'' by Grand Funk Railroad: Produced by
%Frank Zappa, from their final studio album of the
%original incarnation (1976's Good singing, Good Playing)
%{\it ((People forget how focused and talented a producer Frank Zappa was.
%This year's Zappa Plays Zappa led by Dweezil was one of the musical happenings
%of the year... of course I did NOT get to see it, but I hope some of you did.))}
%
%3) ``Tempus Fugit'' by Yes: Trevor Horn takes vocals on this
%album, Drama, instead of Jon Anderson, prior to his
%stint as opening act on MTV in The Buggles.  One of
%the ten best true rock songs of all time.
%{\it ((You probably all know how much I like the Buggles,
%and Yes was the very first rock concert I ever went to in person,
%before Trevor Horn joined the group, of course.))}

GUESSES ON THIS TURN, FIND LAST TURN
1. joakim
2. rick desper
3. brad wilson
4. dick martin
5. richard smith
6. you

and my songs will be:

1. Hindemith - Mathis der Mather - Hindemith is
usually brass-heavy, sometimes to the point of
distraction.  In this piece however the balance is
perfect, especially if you find a good performance.

2. Gary Wright - Who Am I? - From his best album, "The
Light of Smiles", sadly not readily available on CD. 
The whole album blows anything else he's done out of
the water, especially side one (since I have it on
LP).

%From: <steve.emmert of cox.net>
%MYSTERY PERSON \#4:
%
%1) ``6 Underground" by Sneaker Pimps: If you know Sneaker Pimps, 
%then you're way too cool for me.  But ``6U" is a terrific tune.
%{\it ((Ah, lots of people are selecting psychedelic or electropop sorts of things.
%``6U'' is from their first and probably best album, I think it reached \#6 on
%the British pop charts, was less popular here in the States.
%Its various members are presently scattered around doing all sorts of side
%or separate projects.
%From what I know, none of that is producing anything terribly exciting, which
%is too bad.))}
%
%2) ``In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" by the Allman Brothers Band:
%``Liz Reed" is the tune that, in my mind, definitively proves that the 
%Allman Brothers were in reality jazz musicians.  It's their tribute to Miles Davis.
%{\it ((I haven't heard this since I was in college in the 1970's and had my 
%jazz show on the radio station.
%I never played this song on that, to my recollection, but I do remember it 
%being an extended drum solo by Trucks and being quite striking.))}
%
%3) ``Spanish Sky" by Chris Isaak:
%``Spanish Sky" is from {\it Heart Shaped World}, the album 
%(back then, they still called them albums) that made Isaak famous with the 
%single, ``Wicked Game."  I doubt I could ever get tired of that CD.
%{\it ((I don't think this is my thing, and I think everyone will know this list 
%isn't mine when
%I say that I think I remember ``Wicked Game" but I'm positive I've never heard the 
%whole CD.))}
