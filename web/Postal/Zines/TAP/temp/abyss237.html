<p><br><p><br>Yes, there is another delay.
I won't bother everyone with all the details, suffice it to say that it was
mostly due to a balky laptop screen at an inopportune time and lots of real
life work.
The next issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i> is on schedule and that was NOT a
cause of the delay, if anyone was wondering ;-)
I have pushed the deadlines for the next issue back to October 7th.  
I will be able to finish the next issue over the long weekend, so
get your orders in for next time quickly.
Sorry about the tight deadline, but most of you should have a handle for
what is needed for that deadline already.
I'm sure I forgot to include some things in here that should be in here.
Please feel free to remind me of those for next issue!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
This will finally be going up soon as the amount 
I lose on every paid subscription rises.
Get your resubs in now and then I'll go up by 50% later this year.
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the new game start announcements below!
BUT, I really won't
start any more until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
Some other options are out there.
Mark Kinney is trying to get his dipszine going again (one game is
already filled), but he may have other openings.
Mark is looking for standbys too.
Contact Mark NOW at 4820 Westmar Terrace #6, Louisville, KY  40222, (502) 412-3079; 
alberich of iglou.com and get on his subscription list.
I'm in the game and you CAN'T miss watching ME play....
there or somewhere else.
Another new szine is out there: Tim Haffey's ``Who Do You Trust?''
He's going to publish monthly at $1.50 an issue, just another 
example of why I really must raise my own rates, I'm subsidizing
too much.
You can E-Mail Tim at: trhaffey of aol.com or trhaffey of concentric.net
and send subs to: Timothy R. Haffey, Sr., 810 53rd Ave., Oakland, CA  94601.

<p>
the szine resides in html format.

The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (VERY, VERY badly) John Caruso's postal
baseball league that I am in.
John and Kathy Caruso are now up on E-Mail and if David doesn't
get off his butt soon and start updating the page more frequently, 
John probably will go invent his own web page.
This is a problem at the present time....

<p>
2) For the most recent issue of Pete Sullivan's subszine 
check out (this address will be changing shortly):

Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR GREGORY STEWART</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Come on, I know we have some BIG Gregory Stewart fans around here.
Even some reminiscences about Mr. Stewart's infamous press style
would be nice.
Fifty bucks for finding him before the deadline for issue 240.
A rumor exists that someone DOES know where he is, but nothing from Gregory yet....
check in next issue for a further update.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com or johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

Some Diplomacy whackos can't wait for the new Worldmasters tournament
to start (LAST CHANCE TO JOIN IS NOW!!!  DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!)
and have been boasting on the ``Boasters!" discussion group
at the 2000 tournament site that they can stop Toby Harris (as no one
in the 1999 tournament, yours truly included, has been able to do).
Well, they needed a forum to prove it, and I have provided it.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'll be posting results to the ``Boasting'' page on the WorldMasters 2000 site. 

<p>
2) Let me know if you have questions about adjudication notes.
Units always end up in the place where I have capitalized.
Italicized orders (which you only can see in the HTML) fail of execution
for some reason or another.
When some git tries a move that is technically impossible, I use (imp)
to note it.
I also use abbreviations like (nso) for no such order (when attempting
supports) and the like.
Most of these should be obvious, ask if they aren't.

<p>
3) A bit of a slow start with press, but I'm sure that will change and
you may be using the web page for press as well.
My comments in the press appear in (( ... )) and are also italicized (in the
HTML).

<p>
4) Amazingly and in the interest of fair play, Toby gets ONE extra unit
to start.  Since you all are going to twist his nuts, why not give him
an extra nut to add to the pain..... this was entirely random, I
assure you!

<p>
5) That's about it for now.  
We're in for a bit of a ride, methinks.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA - ALL): ``I hereby declare this opening the ``Rasputin" opening ....
because Rasputin screwed Russia up just as much as this around about the same
era." 
<i>((Fascinating how the Rasputinal personality of yours casts all sorts
of shadows across the board.
Stunning.... hyork, hyork, hyork!!))</i>

<p>
(TWERG): Wow, that fella is convincing. Jim-Bob I can see why
you did what you did in M9925. Guys, you'd better get
saddled up and ready to whip my ass into line 'cos I
can see myself becoming Twerg-Boob before long ..... 
<i>((So YOU are the one who caved on those wacky Russian moves....
hyork, hyork, hyork!))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-RUSSIA): Was that all you could come up with??? ;)
<i>((No, he could come up with lots more, don't encourage him!))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-ITALY): Nice doggy, sit! nice doggy
<i>((That wouldn't have something to do with some insider knowledge
on another player's moves, would it?
Nahhh, couldn't be....))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-AUSTRIA): I have changed my mind...Warzaw is mine ok?
<i>((Right....))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-FRANCE): Miiiiiine all miiiiiiine
<i>((Any votes on the concession to Niclas?
That'll do it.
You guys should have lots to talk about this week, I'd say.))</i>

<p>
Greetings all,

<p>
A month and a half ought to get you over WDC, and it's time to play Dip
again!  If you're anywhere near the Boston area (or would like to be)
come on by and join us for the 14th running of Diplomatic Incident.
Lots of Diplomacy and other gaming, a fun housecon setting and a good
time for all.  If you publish, then I'd appreciate your spreading the
word if you have an issue coming out before the end of September.  
If you want to come but need crash space, 
drop me a line and we'll work something out.

<p>
Directions are below:

<p>
Contact: Dave Partridge  rebhuhn of rocketmail.com  603-886-1400 x212

<p>
Date:  September 30, October 1, 2000; we start around 11AM each day!

<p>
Location: 12 Yarmouth St, Boston, MA

<p>
Nearest T: BackBay Station on the Orange line or Copley Square Station on
the Green line.

<p>
From either:
Exit the station to Dartmouth St. Walk to Columbus St. (1/2 block to the
left from BackBay Station, or 2 blocks past the Copley Plaza Hotel from
Copley Square Station). Go right on Columbus St. Make the next right onto
Yarmouth St.  We're mid way down the block on the left.

<p>
Parking: Good luck. There are several garages in the square block bounded by
Dartmouth St., St. James St., Clarendon St. and Columbus Ave. (BackBay Station
is inside that block, for those of you without a map :-)) All are expensive,
but not as bad as a ticket and tow by Boston's Finest. The garage at Copley
Place Mall (St. James &amp; Exeter, beneath the Marriott Hotel) is only a block
further away and the shops inside the mall validate. To get to the games,
just wander around inside the Mall until you find the ``Dartmouth St/ BackBay
Station" exit - its at the Neiman Marcus end. If you can't figure things out
from there, you shouldn't be playing Diplomacy...

<p>
Jim,

<p>
A few things...

<p>
First, I've been hearing a lot (much via <i>TAP</i>) about the World DipCon in 
Baltimore. I did not attend because a) I'm poor and b) I counted myself as a 
super-newbie-novice-wannabe and thus quite out-of-place at such a huge 
gathering. I've since then been promoted, moved and begun to get a bit more 
involved with this hobby. (i.e. <i>The DRAGON</i>, a sub-zine of <i>ABSOLUTE!</i>). 
I've also noted the first issue of <i>DIPLOMACY WORLD</i> online which I thought was 
fantastic. I intend to harass Scott Morris until he takes a look at MY 
variants! Anywho, the point is this: I'm interested in saving up to attend 
World DipCon 2001 or 2002 (or both!) and I haven't been all that successful 
at finding info on either. If there are websites, addresses, etc. that I can 
contact to get basic info on these events I'm sure you'll have them before 
anyone else. I'm a young, idealist little punk looking to make an impact. If 
the Hobby has use for me I'm here.
<i>((I will provide that information as it becomes available.
You can always check out the Diplomatic Corps (diplomaticcorps.org) or
currently their FTF Tournament Schedule is at:

<p>
http://www.diplomaticcorps.org/ComingEvents/ComingEventsList.html

<p>
The 2001 World DipCon is in Paris, July 27-29, and many hobbyists will be gathering
in London to travel there by train.
I have not decided for sure if I am going, but if I do (since I will be in England
just before that) I shall join that trek and I would urge all Americans and English
speakers going to do so.

<p>
There is a really neat site already up for the 2002 World DipCon in Australia too:

<p>
http://www.wdc2002downunder.com/

<p>
How's that for info??))</i>

<p>
Secondly, I would like the opportunity to say SHAME to your readership for 
the stalled interest in Star Trek Diplomacy. I grabbed up the Ferengi 
because I've been looking for a chance to prove their true dominance over 
lesser-lobed races like the Cardassians. (New Rule of Acquisition: Never 
trust a Cardassian. Never, never, never, never...) To those last three 
potential players I'd like to make a blanket offer to not attack you at all 
during the first turn. Now you have no reason not to sign up! You're 
practically guaranteed victory (under me)!
<i>((Thanks for the push, if I don't get some more interest soon, I'm
going to have to drop it and return your money, Chris, you're the only
one who paid so far...))</i>

<p>
Many thanks, Mr. Burgess!

<p>

<p>
P.S. Keep an eye on ``Secrets." I predict big action in the coming year... 
(Hint, hint, Stan.)

<p>
<i>((You're lucky I let you have ANY secrets with that ``Mr. Burgess''
stuff, and if you're going to BE like that, I must insist it be Dr. Jim-Bob
as I do have a Ph.D., you know.... we'll see, won't we.))</i>

<b>James Alan Tretick (Tue, 1 Aug 2000 19:54:55 EDT)</b>

<p>
Jim,
I've been following <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> for a few years now, since Jim
wrote me and wondering if Bernie Tretick could be found. I told him I'd call
my dad and ask him if he'd like to be found. Well, he did. And as they say,
``the rest is history." Or, I guess history is being rewritten again (or
still).
And, a comment on Harry Andruschak's ramblings about Kathy Caruso. I flirted
in person with Kathy Caruso face-to-face 20 PLUS years ago when I was a teenager.
Then, she promptly turned around and stabbed my Ass. And she knew what she
was doing.
Well, I'm thinking about jumping back into the hobby. Who wants a piece of me
first?
And for the record, no one ever wrote any orders for me, or vice versa.

<p>

<i>((And equally for the record, as we opposed each other in games
many times back in that 20 plus years ago period, I never thought anything else
but that.

back and join in somehow.

#14: Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 2 - September 11, 2000

<p>
I have moved and settled in to my new apartment. The new address is:
171 South Street, Apt. A-16, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130,
new home/cell phone #: (617) 596-6158.

<p>
The new place is a one-bedroom in an apartment building. It's a couple of 
blocks to the Forest Hills T-stop so if I jump on a commuter rail train at 
8.50am, I'm at my office at South Station just after 9am. I'm also a couple 
of blocks from the Harvest Coop - a fact that may help me make my daily 
diet a little healthier.

It's a relief to be back in my own place. I spent August in the third floor 
(read attic) of my old building sharing a bathroom and kitchen with my 
landlady on the second floor. (Meanwhile, my old first floor apartment was 
rented out to a new couple.) I am glad that I'm now dealing with a faceless 
bureaucracy instead of a flaky landlady.

The tape thing has become a CD thing and still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I think I'll end up doing this over the Christmas vacation this year.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.
Thanks VERY much to Paul Rauterberg who has given me a whole bunch of info
that will be invaluable in converting songs from vinyl records to CD.

It was cool to find an email message from Allan B. Calhamer in my mailbox.  
By the way, Amazon.com is selling his book for $17.10, and they have a nice 
review of it by Conrad von Metzke.

<p>
Great issue, with all that stuff about Dipcon, Survivor and the shocking news 
about Robert Sacks.  I was a late convert to Survivor, missing the first 
month of it until all the hype (and your comment that it was of interest to 
Dippers) made me decide that resistance was futile.  It was a better show 
than I expected, and I'm going to see the shows I missed the first time.

<p>
It seems most of the contestants didn't realize that this was a Diplomacy 
game, and so they were sitting ducks for Richard's alliance.  Most of the 
activity on the island seemed to center around the challenges, and perhaps 
they considered those to be the heart of the game.  My theory is that losing 
a challenge is something akin to being passed a calamity in the board game 
Civilization - a nuisance, but it doesn't have a big impact on who the 
eventual winner is.  How many challenges did Richard or Rudy win?  True, 
winning challenges almost won the game for Kelly, but only after she won the 
last four immunity challenges, which shouldn't happen often.

<p>
Most people didn't expect Richard to win, mainly because it seemed he'd 
stepped on too many toes to win the final vote, and that people would vote 
for Rudy.  But he came up with a brilliant way of dumping Rudy without losing 
his vote:  by throwing the last immunity challenge.  He counted on Kelly to 
have the sense to see she'd have a better chance against him than Rudy.  If 
Kelly hadn't won all those challenges, Sue would have been in the last 3 
instead of Kelly, and the same strategy should have worked.  Richard should 
have been able to throw the last challenge to Sue, since she'd have more 
stamina than Rudy regardless of what the challenge was.  I have to wonder how 
early in the game Richard came up with this idea of intentionally losing the 
last immunity challenge.

<i>((He says now that he was thinking about that quite early.
With his type of ego, one has to wonder how much of that to believe,
but he did say it (he is local to me in Rhode Island).
He did lose at least one other immunity challenge that I observed on purpose.))</i>

Jim - I don't recall seeing anything in your last
issue about Zine Register #29. I hope you will
mention, at the very least, that it is published
and available for $2, and that samples from the
Zine Bank can be had for $3.
<i>((See ad in this issue....))</i>

<p>
Re: ``Survivor," I loved the show and was
amazed Rich won - not because I thought he was a
slimeball or anything such, but I thought there
would be enough resentment of him among those who
had been voted out that there was no way he would
capture enough votes to win.

<p>
I'm not surprised that Colleen, Jenna and
Gervase voted against him, or that Rudy voted for
him. It surprised me a little that Sean voted for
him, despite Sean inviting Rich aboard the yacht
- I thought Sean would have been turned off by
Rich's machinations with the allinace and turning
the experience into something that wasn't fun
(for laid-back Sean).

<p>
And I never thought Sue would hold such a
grudge against Kelly, as I recalled Sue saying
early on that she wanted to eliminate Rich at the
very end and spoil his tremendous effort. In the
end, I think her take was like some of us
Diplomacy players: The person we hate more in a
game is the person we thought was our ally and
who turned on us, rather than the guy who
attacked us from the start.
   
<p>
As for Greg, I'm not sure that his ``pick a
number" routine was real - he might have wanted
to vote for Rich, due to something that came out
of their conversations when the two tribes
merged) but didn't want to let on to everyone
that he consciously picked Rich, and so he made
his choice seem as arbitrary as Sean's
``alphabetical strategy."
   
<p>
So three cheers for Rich for masterminding a
game-winning strategy, including playing people
along the way to assure himself of being one of
the two finalists. But I think, once the last
vote was held, that he had to be the most scared
at any time of failing. No guts, no glory, is
what I always say!

<p><br><p><br><b>John Harrington</b>

<p>
Jim,
Caught a little bit of an electoral address by a surprisingly animated
Al Gore on CNN yesterday.  I can't remember his exact words but it went
something along the lines of ``the USA is the greatest country in the
world, always has been, always will be".  Good rabble-rousing stuff even
if the ``always will be" claim is a bit hyperbolic!  Is Gore claiming his
Presidency would so utterly transform the USA that for the rest of
eternity it would be immune to the sort of slump that eventually
overtook the Greeks, the Romans and the Britons?  Or is his plan to make
good on his pledge by eliminating all the other countries so the USA is
number one in a field of one?
<i>((I kinda understand Gore, since I am sometimes plagued by his 
``overstating runneth at the mouth" disease, though I try to keep it
curbed.
Don Williams recently reminded me that I am failing at it again occasionally.
It is this sort of thing that gets him wrongly quoted as saying that he
invented the Internet.
But to your point, we might NEED something like this to deal with all of
the growth in power and influence of multi-national corporations, but
I doubt he would achieve the rest of it, even if he tried.))</i>

<p>
Daft of me, I know, to pay too much attention to a mere sound-bite but
this national supremacy line always rankles me whether it comes from
German Nazis, smug Brits, Japanese imperialists or whoever.
<i>((Ditto, I try to get most of my international news from foreign
sources, which seems to help a lot.))</i>

<p>
Looks like we'll be having our own election next year and doubtless
we'll be subjected to a similar sort of nationalist tub-thumping.  The
realisation that Britain no longer has an empire has dawned on even the
most right wing politician so our version of Gore's line goes something
like ``We may not be great but by God every other nation on earth is
worse than us".  It may just be my perception but it seems that whilst
Americans talk their own worth up, the Brits talk everybody else's down.
End of horrible generalisation.

<p>
I am considering a career as a High Court judge.
<i>((So, are you a lawyer too? ;-)  If you were, you could join the lawyer game.))</i>

<p>
It is widely considered to be one of the prerequisites of the job to be
completely out of touch with popular culture and as I seem to be the
only person in Britain not to have watched (the UK version of) Big
Brother I qualify on at least one count.  Thanks to your detailed
coverage of Survivor I actually know more about that show than I do Big
Brother.  Hell, I even know that the US has its own version of Big
Brother and that it is floundering in the ratings.  
<i>((Worse than that, it's a total disaster.
I caught 30 seconds of it the other night and they had brought back IN
someone they had kicked out of the house for a ``visit''.
Their biggest problem is that all of the interesting people leave.
Obnoxious.
Richard Hatch the other day caught himself in the middle of saying that
Big Brother was real crap next to Survivor! and added, ``hey, I guess that
is the same network, I don't want to say any more about it''.))</i>

<p>
Nothing in <i>TAP</i> 236 changes my opinion that the only people who need to
``get a life" more than we Diplomacy players (who at least are DOING
something, albeit irrelevant) are Survivor fans.
<i>((I suppose you don't like watching Dip
games (postal or FTF either, eh?).  I do (part of why I like GMing).))</i>

<p>
Actually I do.  Postally I watch games mainly so I'll appreciate the
press better.  Some players can be very interesting and funny writers
when motivated by a game's interaction, so I'd probably read Dip
game's press even if I didn't like Dip.  Face-to-face, it depends
partly on who the players are.  At the World Championships, I slept in
one morning and came to the con site around noon.  When I wasn't playing
something else I walked around the Dip boards a bit, but mostly sat
around and read the newspaper.  Even when excellent players are
involved, the slow rate of board development in FTF means I don't stay
interested unless people with whom I have a long postal or convention
history are in dynamic situations.

<p>
<i>((But you aren't far off and certainly I enjoy playing Dip far more
than I enjoy watching Survivor.))</i>

<p>
I am reassured.  I consider Survivor contestants in the same range as
Big Brother contestants, and Diplomacy players far different.  I don't
know if a televised-Diplomacy fan base would be heavier with
Survivor-fan priorities or Dip-player attitudes.  

<p>
So when will the Pouch archive page or Szine.com include a JimBobWebCam
video feed?  It'd be incredible in a Dip tournament.  It'd be incredibly
awful at certain other times.  And you'd have to censor the picture when
drinking mint juleps with Steve Emmert or doing anything else with his
face in view.

<p>
<i>((What's with the crack about Emmert??
You're now in the Amateur Division game against his Professional Division game.))</i>

<p>
``the Emmert joke"??  YOU'RE the one who printed the baby picture with
Steve's face in it.  You deserve whatever you get from the Lawyers Game.

<p>
<i>((I do indeed....))</i>

<p>
I sent Bruce Linsey a copy of the Robt material.  He said all old
differences aside, it was a shame.  I had the same experience with
Robert at Hunt Valley as Buz described.  I wasn't surprised, though, as
his attitude was similar a year or two earlier at a Vertigo Games.  He
was the first gamer face I saw when I got to the con site Thursday.  We
chatted then and a couple more times over the weekend.  He consistently
seemed to be enjoying life.  That's as it should be, whether you have a
day left or several decades.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>TWO NEW GAME OPENINGS (guest written by brilliant counselor at law Steve Emmert):

<p>
In many of the games run in this szine and elsewhere, there is a fundamental
element of unfairness that taints the entire process.  Diplomacy is a game
of honor and treachery; of loyalty and betrayal; of truth and lies.  But it
is fundamentally a competition among people seeking to manipulate one
another, and therein lies the problem.  The problem is lawyers, who
occasionally play in games without disclosing their profession.  You see, I
(and many other like-minded GM's) feel it is fundamentally unfair to require
amateur liars to compete against professionals.

<p>
But we can't merely shut the whole legal profession out of the hobby.  There
are, after all, several excellent Diplomacy players among the members of the
bar, and they have a right of free association, too.  I have decided that
the best way to reconcile these two opposing concerns is to offer each camp
its own separate theater of operation.  Accordingly, I hereby announce two
gamestarts, each of which shall be Regular Diplomacy.  One, open only to
attorneys, will be titled, ``The Professional Division."  The other, open
only to nonlawyers, will be called, ``The Amateur Division."  
These games, which I propose to begin simultaneously,
should provide an interesting case study on this particular form of
``professionalism."

<p>
If you have any problems with the structure of the foregoing, you can speak
with my attorney.

<p>
Best wishes.  Steve
Lord of the Three Capitals

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!

<p>
REGULAR GAME: Rick Davis, Jim Burgess,
Randy Ellis, Mike Barno, Scott Munson, Kent Pollard, and Bob Osuch 
<i>((Yes, THAT Bob Osuch....))</i>
with Russ Rusnak as the guest GM 
are the players here - it filled VERY quickly.
We'll run both games with standard fees and rules.
The $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance) gives you 
a subscription for the life of the game, which usually is a bargain
at twice the price.
The game name will be "The Amateur Division" and players will be
expected to repeatedly make fun of lawyers and their foibles in
the press.
We're already showing how the Amateurs know how to get a game
started quickly and on time.
Lawyers ONLY know how to delay and postpone the inevitable -
hmmm, except for death and taxes, they cannot be delayed, can they??

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The other Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've still forgotten who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Dan Gorham has resigned as Austria and Paul Rauterberg has kindly replaced
him.
The players had already been notified of this change.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(POPATOVIASKY: A RATHER SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KIEV, UKRAINE, FORMERLY WHITE 
RUSSIA [Circa 1800]): Mother Russia stared out of her window noting that 
each fall, dozens of excursion railroads across the Northeast of Russia 
start bulging with passengers eager to view the reds and golds of autumn 
foliage. She wondered why these trips are so popular? It is the lure of 
a train ride across a sun-soaked valley in an open-air gondola car with 
wisps of soft-coal smoke in your nose and the chorus of a three-chime 
steam whistle in your ears. She also noted that Austria had far more 
pretty views, and then, decided, perhaps, maybe, to go there.

<p>
(ELLENORA, A ONCE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN OF KIEV): Shark Infestation and Crab 
Meat Press: Mother Russia, The Tzar's Mother, and his lover, came up 
with a clever thought, muttering to himselflessness, ``If you want to get 
something, start by thinking about how you can help others get what they 
want. If you can get enough people what they want, you'll start getting 
what you want back." So, he set out to give England and Germany what 
they had been asking for all along to see if his theory would work.

<p>
(POPATOVIASKY: A RATHER SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KIEV, UKRAINE, FORMERLY WHITE 
RUSSIA [Circa 1900]): The Tzar, a rather witty feller at that, thought 
that if it worked once, it will work again. So, the proverbial finger 
probed with a suddenness one could not believe. Concurrently, the Tzar 
grabbed holt' of a stick. The Kaiser shot up into the air, and the Tzar 
waited for the sudden surge upward into the foul air of the saloon. And, 
then he noticed the stick that he had grabbed, squishing through his 
fingers, and dropping down onto his face. He retorted, ``Oh, no, not 
another German terd!" The Kaiser once again stuck into the rafters, and 
once again, broke loose, this time by swaying with his legs. The Kaiser 
dropped to the floor and looked around for that certain someone who gave 
him the finger again. Luckily, the Tzar was nowhere to be found, hiding, 
as it were, in the brown of it all. A smile rounded the Tzar's already 
fat face as he heard a little boy say that he was there to clean the 
spittoons. The Tzar muttered, ``Free at last, free at last", wondering 
when he heard that before. The little boy picked up the spittoon and 
walked outside . out back, as it were, and, ``OH! NO!" . dumped the 
contents of the spittoon into the outhouse hole. The once merely brown 
Tzar turned a few more shades of brown as he sank deep down into the 
muck and the mire. But, then, that is all his association with the 
Kaiser has ever produced in the first place.

<p>
(SPOTSYLVANIA): Not to even try to top all that has been said and printed, 
did you know that Bob Sacks was one of the Ushers at my [first] wedding. 
We ``lived" in the same dorm. Age difference, you say! Yes! I just turned 
68, and the Bob Sacks I knew in college was my age then. Perhaps he got 
younger as he aged. Perhaps he had a father with the same name.
<i>((But of course, Robert was always ``Robert'' or at least ``Rob't''.))</i>

<p>
(FREDRICKSBURG PATENT OFFICE): A startling discovery was made here today 
when Bernie discovered what the healthiest light bulb was. When asked by 
the Patent Officer to state in clear, concise language, just what made 
that light bulb the healthiest of all, Bernie wrote, ``One that has not 
yet been taken out of the package! It has not yet been screwed in, 
screwed up, or screwed over!" The Patent Officer asked, ``Oh, you're not 
another Diplomacy player, are you?"

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note John Power's new postal address and Bob Acheson's new E-Mail address.

<p>
2) No one likes the new map.  I am going to try to get Harold Reynolds
to fix the last one I was using.
Even if he doesn't, that is the one I am going to use.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-SPAIN): None taken unfortunately the maneuver has put me out of 
the game plus I expected to lose it and since I don't know the map all that 
well it cost me.

<p>
(OTTO-SPAIN): Dear Sir; I should like to apply for a lackey or minion
position with your organization; am willing to work for opportunity of
vengeance on my betrayer!!!

<p>
(SEAN-PAUL): Are you saying I was allied with China and Ottoman?
My removals were based on places I didn't feel I could hold and I felt I 
needed to do something in Africa it looked like I was about to lose Uga 
which I didn't count on, otherwise I should have allied with 
Ottoman/China/Austria from the get go.

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-AUSTRIA): Well, you're probably wanting to do this anyway, 
so hey I'll offer it.
I tried contacting you by e-mail and all attempts have failed they never 
seem to go through so the best I can do right now is hold off England and 
Russia while you go for Sam and Mel otherwise England and/or Russia is going 
to take them I'll do my best to hold Mel, but either way you should take Sam 
I'm not even going to defend it nor can I defend it my best bet is holding 
off Russia and England.

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-THE BOARD): I definitely would have better off figuring out how 
to continue the original Netherlands strategy I may or not be better off for 
that.

<p>
(PARIS): Have the French been out to lunch lately? Here' why: Steen Raymond 
Alme arrived on the 25th of August at 2:31 AM. He weighed 7 pounds, 10 
ounces. He is our first child (and my folk's first grandchild). Looks like 
he got the red hair coming from his mother and all of his paternal uncles, 
but he will have to settle for my weak chin. Steen is a 
scandinavian-flavored name common in my family; it is a variation on the 
Norwegian/Swedish/Danish/etc. words for `stone'. Considering the difficulty 
of his birth, and the way he has bounced back, it is apt.

<p>
(FRANCE-SPAIN): The build in QUE is not hostile, I'm just feeling a bit thin 
out there.

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-BOARD): Are we winning, are we winning, are we winning?
 
<p>
(NETHERLANDS OFFICIALS-THEIR PEOPLE): NO!

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SCOTT [on the bottle again] to STAN): It was great hearing from you!
So that WAS New Mexico!
Yep!
I'm a moron all right!

<p>
(TSAR KRISTOF - KAISER JOHANNSOHN): Thank you for the armistice.
I'm certain that this will be the best course of action for both
our peoples.

<p>
(SCOTT to CHRIS): See?
I am a man of my word!

<p>
(ANNOYING LITTLE MAN - FRANCE): WAKE UP!!!!!!!

<p>
(AMBASSADOR MUNSON to AMBASSADOR SASSEVILLE): You know that we could help each
other out, don't you?
Actions still speak louder than words, don't they?

<p>
(TUR-ITA): Do you plan on attacking Russia any time soon?

<p>
(AMBASSADOR MUNSON to THE HONORABLE MR. SCHULTZ): It appears we still haven't
come to a satisfactory agreement on how to divide up the late Zarr's holdings.
More negotiations are needed.

<p>
(ITALY-ENGLAND): After all these years I still space Jim's
separate seasons - so - okay - as you asked....

<p>
(TRENT - JIM-BOB): Apologies.
My new phone number is (916) 489-6138.
Gracias, senor!

<p>
(IN ANKARA): The Sultan, contented with his harem and various concoctions,
snuggled down into the soft pillows and supple bodies of his bed chamber.
``Life is good, my darlings...''

<p>
Leaning back, he spotted his preferred lover.
His hands found her body, lightly gliding over her muscular thigh, to softly
follow the curves of her ribs, barely touching the beautiful skin.
Too thin, he thought to himself.
But it was not just her body that drew him near.
His eyes sought out hers, only to find her chin tucked into her breast,
eyes glowering at him, the hint of a smile fluttering about the corners of
her mouth.
``You know what I need, my beloved?" 
She stretched, straightening a pillow with the toes of her left foot.

<p>
``What, oh beautiful child?''

<p>
``You need some of those gorgeous, mischievous Italian girls to join our family.''

<p>
``But my lovely, we are not at war with the Italians.
Do you suppose they will just part with their daughters for our pleasure?''

<p>
Her penetrating gaze settled upon him, hardening into a stone mask of resolve.
``But who, my mighty lover, would stop you from claiming a few of their most
amazing daughters from the lower peninsula?''

<p>
Held for a mere moment, the gaze dissolved into a sensual smile, and then into
an outright laugh.
The Sultan snorted and laughed, and only then did he realize, he had been
holding his breath.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) For the final game year, Jody is Austria, Richard is England, 
Sara is France, John is Germany, Heath is Italy, Mike is Russia
(with one less nuke), and Sandy is Turkey. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RICHARD to ALL): I must compete and hurt a potential winner, even if 
that throws the game assuredly to someone who is trying too hard - the 
``Rich" of Yuppie Dip!  I know you'd do the same Mikey-poo. 

<p>
(MILANO to SARAJEVO):  Oh, too bad, Richard.  All your black press seems
to have gotten you a zero.  If Jody figures out it was you usurping his
name almost every season, you might get another zero for '07.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): Good news for all you ``Survivor" fans - especially the jerk 
who sent me an unwanted e-mail that had ``survivor" spelled wrong. They are 
currently filming SURVIVOR-LA for release in Spring 2001.  Five people will 
cruise the LA freeway system.  Whenever a tire blows, they vote as to which 
person will be required to leave the Ford Explorer. 

<p>
(MADCON VETERAN to `POTHEAD' [two synonyms]):  Silly you, overhead cams
aren't found in any of NASCAR's three national series or the ten
regional touring series sanctioned by NASCAR.  PHththph!!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-INTERNET USERS): I tried to use some of the search engines 
available to AOL subscribers, but was unable to locate anything about ``Henry 
Seduschak."  As for ``The Dungeon Master," I got several thousand hits, all 
for computer related games.  Big help.  

<p>
(MIKE to HARRYSCHAK):  If I meet you in a game where you have more than
three dots, I will be glad to oblige you by relieving you of the excess
centers.

<p>
(JOHN-BOARD): I hung with the big boys and girls this time.

<p>
(SADWEISS-ALL): If I read the rules correctly, then I am the winner!  
Thank you one and all.  This has been a great game.  Thank you for 
bombing me the most times in the final year.  Difficult to achieve with 
two naked fat Rich's not bombing anyone this time.  Sheesh guys.  Are 
you trying to like be diplomatic and obtain the most SCs?  The deal is 
to be nuked the most.  And I won.  Barely beat out doe-doe head JimBob 
however.

<p>
(MIKE to JIM):  I disagree with one point in your response to Harry: 
It's an HONOR to be erroneously slammed by John Boardman.  I may have to
fake another zine and send him a copy, that the Father of the Postal
Hobby might cast his wrath upon me.

<p>
(WHITEDAM-ALL): France can't be reached or breached.  His knickers 
will stay up for the final round.  That gives him 19.  I guess Mr/Ms 
Kinney could get to 17, but 16 is more likely.  And Ms/Mr Jody looks 
forlorn at maybe 16/17.  Of course I am blown away, but that's the way I 
like it.  The more animosity, the more nukes, the better.  Especially 
from Christina Jorgenson herself.  Blow me away Sarah sweetie.  Your hot 
nukie lips feel so good on my Bud.  Yes, Ser!  And poor little Mikey, 
well, upstate NY gets cold this time of the year.  He can go Deer 
Hunting.  He could tie John-John.  At best.  But, you don't have to read 
this, read the results. 

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-DEMOCRATS): Frankly guys, I am disgusted at your cheap shots at 
Bush. For example, why do you make such a big fuss when he mentioned that the 
Clinton-Gore administration had been in power 4 years, even though it has 
been 8 years?  Kindly remember that at the time he was holding a microphone 
in one hand and thus had only the other hand for counting.

<p>
(GAME-NAMER AND RULE MAKER): New rule for next game.  Do it and I'm 
in.  Any none-thrown nukes on either the GM or a truly named space are 
deducted from the individual's final score of SCs!  Or else call the 
next game milk-toast and set up a hall-of-fame web sight for "winners."
   
<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Count me in for the next NYEED.  As for a name, has EDWARD 
TELLER been used yet?  As The Father Of The American Hydrogen Bomb, he 
certainly deserves some sort of tribute.
<i>((I like that idea....))</i>

<p>
(GAME-NAMERS): Father of the Atomic bomb is still alive.  Let's see, 
is his name William Tell?  William Tell-her?  William Tell-him?  Go 
Tell-him?  William Tell-us?  William Tell-us-star?  William Tell-them?  
Go Tell-Them on the Mountain, over the hill and everywhere . . .?  And 
he says that Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Roswell are each safe, 
no fear of leaks.  Same for the proposed nuclear storage site minutes by 
foot from Las Vegas.  And did I tell you about the brand new fault they 
found lying under Napa CA?  I think they call it the ``too-much-tannin 
fault."
  
<p>
(BARNO to ALL):  If you nuke me in 1907 I'll start writing Harold Zarr
press and won't stop.

<p>
(MIKE REFLECTS):  No, that's too nasty a threat to even use as a
bargaining tool.  I wouldn't do the Zarr press torture.

<p>
(RACOUNTER-SADDAM): Ah, my spry little fellow.  While the Saddam's 
away, the racounter will play!  And then the first of the sand-storm 
troika appeared at the tentway.  Lifting the veil of the tent, but not 
of her costume, Sarah Right Heart, entered with an enchanting hip wiggle 
intro to the Bossa Nova Belly Dance of the Seven Shivas.  The eighth 
Shiva was back at the Mirage, waiting for the show to go on once Wayne 
Newton showed.  But, he had taken his camel to the Sands.  Opening sand 
storm.  And, so the Racounter laid back, delighted to watch his favorite 
Shiva shiver and shake.  Tonight, with the help of a duck he had 
secreted back in Onan, and the publisher of his tales, he would finally 
disrobe the Seventh Shiva, and find out whether he was the winner of 
hole #1 or hole #2.  ``Come on down" he said to the quivering Sarah Right 
Heart, Seventh Shiva. 
   
<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-JODY): Help!  I am a heterosexual trapped in a heterosexual body.  
Or something like that.  

<p>
(RICHARD-JODY):  If you are a lesbian trapped in a man's body - do you 
like strap on dildoes?  Only oral sex?  Have very passionate areolas?  
Please do explain this in lay terms!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Scott Munson has built up OODLES of abuse points to be spent
on the rest of you, so WATCH out!!
My fingers are tired now....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BIG BASTARD MUNSON to GM): Seeing as you truly enjoy being abused (you 
damn masochistic bastard!), I feel the best way to torture your little
soul is by writing, not e-mailing you, the most ludicrous drivel, and of such a
disturbing magnitude, as to make you cry yourself to sleep over your computer.
<i>((I am still working off chits from years and years and years of doing 
this to the GMs of games I played in.... ask Don Williams, for one.))</i>
Lord knows that I never write anything above the ``amazingly dense-headed''
or just ``plain ignorant'' level, anyway.
Ludicrous drivel should be an attainable goal.
I'm busy attempting to straighten out my life at the moment, only to find
some amazing kinks (always been a kinky bastard) and downward spirals.
Attainable goals are needed just to keep me from swallowing the business
end of my Webley and Scott (a cheer for the old British warhorse!)
I've quit drinking, and have gone into `hermit-mode'.
Cheap beer has been killing me.
I've got to stick to my own homebrew or the quality stuff (Murphy's, Moose Drool,
Guinness, Full Sail, etc.).
Had a black-out incident were, as a good friend so aptly put it, 
``mystery guest #1'' appeared.
I think you know what I mean.
One of those scenes where someone went out drinking last night, and it
wasn't the Scott Munson character that usually uses that body.
The biggest problem I have with it is that I don't look drunk
during these episodes.
People tell me that I walk fine, talk fine, DRIVE fine (lord help me!)
and seem sober.
Not ``Oh!
Scott seems to have a good buzz on!''
More like, ``Hey Scott!
Why ain't'cha drinking?
Have one on me, big guy!
Play some pool?'' 
And this is when I'm so fucking polluted I can't find my backpocket.
And being the moron I am, I accept and proceed to get taken for all I'm
worth on the table, all the while kicking back another half dozen pints
of cheap American swill.
(note: the only thing I've found Anheuser-Busch and other big U.S. breweries
good for is consistency.
The American Pilsner is a bland sort of fare, good for hot summer days and
works when you're broke.
I'm more of a fan of darker ales, porters and stouts, and they all happen to be 
pretty easy to make at home.
If you haven't tried homebrewing, do so.
It's a blast and hard to mess up.)
Talk about a way to screw up your weekend!
Can't remember the first night of it, and spend the rest of it in bed recouping.
I'm just kinda fed up with the whole bar scene, which in Gardiner, is just about
the only scene.
So, now I'm looking for a new place to hang my hat.
I've been thinking about the Oregon/Washington area (Sorry Terry T.!
There goes the neighborhood, eh?)
or possibly back in the Pittsburgh, Buffalo or Cleveland areas.
Kansas could be a possibility.
Fresno sounds like a ghetto, and this is coming from someone talking
about going to Buffalo!
Lord!

<p>
(RUSSIA to AUSTRIA): I'm trying to hold out against
you as long as I can....

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE WORLD):
The military forces of my nation are attempting unorthodox maneuvers vhich I 
hope vill prevail against za fuzzyheaded nations zat ve are currently at Var 
vith! (I't is goot to try new zhings)
Also,please forgive me for not participating at the World Dip... I am only a 
rookie and I need a little more Field Action before I meet you Ole Pro's in 
combat...I mean Diplomacy......

<p>
(POPE SPEEDICUT to SULTAN): And what exactly did you wish to hear?
I write to you, not as an adversary, but as a friend.
Do you want to hear a bunch of lies, sweet nothingness being
poured into your unbelieving ear?
The saying goes ``Live by the pen, or die by the sword.''
So who exactly is going to die if negotiations remain silent between us?
It seems to me that it would have been in your better interests to 
speak up and proffer some ideas to this rookie, instead of sitting
on your ass in your hidie-hole, disgruntled with the situation.
As a matter of fact, this last turn would have been an ideal time
for you to speak up and ``offer your enlightened suggestions.''
Even though we are battling, your ideas still hold weight.
Sure Mike!
I offer you Munich as a peace gift, oh mighty Sultan!
Take it if you care to.
And by the way, here comes your fucking pizza.
Hope it's still hot enough for you....

<p>
(GENERAL MUNCHOUSEN to THE TURKISH ARMY IN BULGARIA):
My troops have not had a chance to greet you personally....You are tenacious 
and cunning.....I hope that in future Battles we may some day be friends.

<p>
(PALACE OF COUNTERATTACK AND RECLAIM INITIATIVE):  As the world press
gets better, our offices release less of it.  Could this be due to
disgust at the minimal amount of incoming communication?  Offense taken
over the foreign dismissal of any consideration of alliance with the
Ottoman Empire?  No.  All the civil servants in the Office of Public
Information have volunteered for militia units reinforcing the armies
defending the Anatolian coasts.

<p>
(AND MORE FOR THE SULKY SULTAN FROM JIZMO): As for not going to DipCon
and having no excuse, how about being broke and needing to keep this
joby-job for awhile.
<i>((Plus a distance of over 2000 miles..... it wasn't like it was
down the highway a piece.))</i>
What do you think the chances of getting time off for gaming in the 
height of the tourist season would be?
Care to offer up a guess, Sunshine?
<i>((We would be considering slim and none and slim just left town....))</i>
If I had time to do what I wnated, I'd be working on classic
cars all morning, brewing beer all afternoon, work my way into some
fine cooking and playing of board games with friends in the evening,
only to finish off with a good two hours of tumbling in the sack
with a nubile nymphet of my choice (Erin, are you out there?).
<i>((Not in THIS szine...... we just lost our nubile nymphet to a
sex-change....))</i>
But I'm afraid I'm stuck in the real world, working at a suck-ass job.
The friends are scattered, I'm broke and Erin is in Wisconsin.
<i>((But Wisconsin isn't on your list of places to go???
Forgive me if I don't get it....))</i>
Please take note that attending the DipCon wasn't in my ideal day.
I do envy those of you able to go.
I think it would be great to get my ass handed to me by a 
bunch of the veterans.
<i>((And believe me, we would have been equally pleased to do it!))</i>
I've, as you know, never played FTF, and I think the mechanics of the
game would be interesting to watch.
But I also think Jim-Bob hit on what my problem would be.
I am an unknown and new to the game, and rather than working
with someone they don't know, the old-timers would prefer to eliminate
the newbies (As Jim described doing himself [to Alan Witte];
funny how they both appeared to have the same score that game ;)  )
in a DipCon situation.
<i>((You characterize things much too simply.
And yes, my fate in most of the Tournament games was not great either.
I am not a very good tournament player for a number of reasons, not least
of which is that I much prefer PLAYING the game to PUSHING the game,
which you have to do in Tournaments.
The luxury of time is not present.
But, this also can be viewed as an excuse.
I play in tournaments better now than I used to, but I still am slow on the 
uptake on key rules....))</i>
Who wants to ally with someone who may not even have an understanding of
stalemate lines?
<i>((Way too simplistic, Scott, I can think of a whole host of reasons,
including precisely that this ally might NOT know where the lines are.))</i>
It could be disasterous.
The tourney is also obviously timed, which I think could put a damper on things,
not to mention completely change all strategy in the game, as discussed in
Issue #236.
It would definitely change how you play the game.
But looking someone in the eye over a board, beer in hand, while
plotting and scheming is going on, would be a definite good time.
You better know how to state a convincing argument, and be smooth
with the presentation, to boot!
No wonder there are a bunch of lawyers playing the game of Diplomacy!
Right up their alley.
It would, without a doubt, separate the men from the boys in a hurry.

<p>
(4TH ARMY GROUP LEAVING MOSCOW): Unt Dammit,I hope this works!!!

<p>
(POPE SPEEDICUT, TO THE MASSES OUTSIDE THE VATICAN): ``All right!!
All you grease balls listen up!!
Here's the deal.
The French Ambassador, after being overheard plotting with enemies
of the good people of Italy by our informants in the States, has
been kicked out of Rome.
Cute blue eyes or not, he had to go!
The French embassy is being purged from the city's landscape by
fire at this moment.
It was tacky as hell and smelled like shit....  Bullshit, to be precise.
Military movements are being made to defend the homeland against 
repercussions and French intrigues.''

<p>
(REPORTING FROM MOSCOW):
....I am currently continuing my search for the body of Harry Flashman.
As I stand here I can see the 4th.army group marching out of the great city and 
making it's way South......strange to do so....winter is on it's way...The 
Austrian High Command must be full of themselves.
Many of their troops follow and only speak of Glory.....

<p>
(OFFICIAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT BY POPE SPEEDICUT): ``Apologies are
due to the Honorable Ambassador Reynolds of Russia and Sir Terry
Tallman, Esq., of the English Parliament.
Relations were ruined between our countries due to the 
undisciplined greed of our northern fleets.
An unfortunate situation, to be sure.
Our sincere apologies for such rash, un-thoughtout behavior.''

<p>
(NONSENSE BY SCOTT MUNSON): ``I, Scott Munson, do hereby attest
to the total yummy goodness of beer.
I climbed onto the wagon for but a moment, and it broke.
I guess wagons don't come in triple `X' double wide load size.
Sorry, folks, but it is now time for a pint of the good stuff.
Take care and have a wonderful season of gaming!''

<p>
(SCOTT to JIM-BOB): Was that good and long-winded enough to
be considered torture?
Hope so!
Have a nice day!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Lots of blood and guts on the floor in this one..... 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EXILED TURK to BOARD): Unbelievable.  Somebody has finally reached double
figures in supply centers.  Is it time to concede to the Gozmeister?  And
why ain't I dead yet?

<p>
(STEVE to DREW): I don't think the Orange play the Spiders this season, so
you can probably look forward to basketball without fear.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): I will be the first to admit that my
early-season baseball predictions are not likely to bear fruit.  Manny
Ramirez won't win the AL MVP unless he goes nuclear again AND leads the
Indians to postseason glory.  (As I type this, it still isn't a sure thing
that they'll even MAKE the postseason.)  Pedro is still looking good as the
Cy, though he could get a serious argument from Wells fans.  In the NL, I
went way out on a limb and picked Randy Johnson for MVP AND the Cy, but it
looks now as though he won't get either.  And my projected NL champs, the
D'Backs, are headed in the wrong direction.  Is it too early to send you
hockey predictions?
<i>((Never.... I picked the NL really well (nailed the Giants comeback),
but haven't picked the AL very well, the Red Sox are in loads of trouble 
and I didn't think Chicago could stay in it.
If the Red Sox somehow get in the playoffs, bet on Pedro for both the MVP
and the Cy though.))</i>

<p>
(EMMERT to JAMES): What, is the sun finally setting on the British Empire?
Is that what's bothering you, Bunky?

<p>
(STEVE to RUSS): HAH!!!!!  Absolutely LOVED your press item to Kurt about his
being a stranger to the truth.  Given my experience with you in this game,
that's akin to your saying, ``Gee, you sure are a BLACK kettle!"  Russ, I
doubt you'd recognize the truth if it walked up and punched you right in the
kisser.  Any time you have any more good jokes like this, please feel free
to run them; it makes the game much more enjoyable for minor powers like me.

<p>
(STEVE to JIM-BOB):  I gotta tell you, this exiled-and-barely-hanging-on stuff
isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I can laugh at the woes of my former
oppressors, call Rusnak names, and generally have a good time, without
worrying about my precious holdings.  What are they gonna do, take all my
home dots?  No worries, no responsibilities, no need to decide who to trust
. . . it still doesn't beat winning, of course, but being one of the
teeny-weeny guys ain't all that bad.

<p>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND): I really hadn't intended this stab to take this long or
be this bloody.  I'd like to blame my ``allies", but I'm pretty sure that the
fault lies with me.  Sorry.  I'll try to do better.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) When I add your replenishment card from now on, it always will be the LAST
card in your list. 

<p>
2) We have two more sprint point awards to make [(2) and (1)] to two of the
riders sitting on square 78.
I'll have to be careful in making sure that the right two riders get the 
points.

<p>
3) We have two more riders dropped from the pack, Chasin' Jason and Famine,
for a total of three so far.
Unless something weird happens, now that a pack has reformed, no one else
should be dropped before the end of the race.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BUHRT - BOOB): This is starting to look ugly.  I predict a crowd
on 78 and maybe 75, gaps all around them.  81, 82, 84 will all
have racers, but 83 and 85 will be empty.  Lots of low cards again!

<p>
(HATTER to TURTLE): See?  Toast at the sprint line.

<p>
(TURTLE to HATTER): You're such a hatter!  I've swum many leagues, so
know coasting when I see it!

<p>
(DARRELL - WHITE RABBIT): More stews in it, if you catch my drift
(and make sure you don't catch his!).

<p>
(WHITE RABBIT): Oh my gosh!  I'm late!  I'm late!  Gotta catch up!

<p>
(ALICE to MANIACS): Looks to me like you got better assets than the Crew
or the pack.

<p>
(HARE to JOHN): What are you carrying on that bike?  What's in your
pocket?  I thought you were just happy to see ... your Rabbi!

<p>
(TFWS): Someone suggested I should air my rubber - any validity to
that concept?

<p>
(BOOB to TFWS): Well, you finally picked up some points!
That's something!!
Now, you MIGHT be able to keep Harry on the sidelines without
points if you pull the right moves next turn.... if the GM 
understands the rules right ;-)

<p>
(HARE to HIMSELF): Time to fade into the pack...

<p>
(DORMOUSE to TFWS): one step at a time, dearie!

1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``The lights went out all over Europe,
and in the darkness of space the stars are blinking with our hope,
as a rocket roars out of the Cape.'' The haunting voice of Sally Timms
on ``Secrets'' (yes, the song the game above is named after...) that
appears on <i>The Curse of the Mekons</i>.
Jeff, this time the quote refers to the actions of your nephew.... or
at least his attempted actions, hyork, hyork, hyork!

<p>
(CAPTAIN KIRK to STARFLEET): Have arrived at the front lines (what a mess).
I have analyzed the situation and I've discovered our problem.
Unknown to the Federation, the evil Captain Kirk from the Alternate Universe
has been commanding the war effort here.
Looking over his battle tactics of the last three years, I have determined
that not only is he evil, he's really stupid.
I have temporarily solved the problem.
I had Mr. Kile beam him out into space.
My first order of business was to borrow an old Klingon bird of prey with a
cloak and send it and my Ambassador (a guy in a red shirt) to Cardassia to
try to get an alliance, and to convince them to end their siege of Bajor
and Deep Space 9.
The Cardassians sent my borrowed Klingon ship back with my Ambassador's throat
cut and a note (ex ti plum equitox), that's Cardassian for ``kiss my Cardassian
ass''.
So much for my diplomatic effort.
We have had a few moderate victories as of late.
The Ferengi attracted one of our flank star bases.
We were just lucky that I guessed right and cut off their supply line so they
had to withdraw.
The Klingons surprised and to some degree unnerved the Ferengi by crossing
the front line in a cloaked battle cruiser to reinforce our flank next to
the former Star Base 96, now the Ferengi focal point of their Federation conquest.
I have to commend the Klingons for their loyalty and their bravery.
Mr. Spock has analyzed the Romulan frontier and determined that they are
using a wormhole to speed up the advance of their Ambassador class warships
to the front.
He noticed a Ferengi Starship patrolling the Federation end of the wormhole
and that the ship was the Ferengi ship ``Batise Seter'' a Ferengi word that
means Cheap Bastard.
Before the war, the ``BS'' had purchased its navigating computer from a 
Federation Excelsior class vessel.
By using his expertise in cryptography, Mr. Spock was able to decode its
combination code and temporarily order the ship to move to the mouth of 
the wormhole and stop any Romulan vessels from coming through.
Federation ships moved in to attempt a temporary harassment takeover
of the Ferengi Starbase, but a smaller Romulan ship, not constrained
by the limitations of the wormhole, happened by as expected on a routine
patrol in preparation for their Federation invasion.
So our chances of taking the enemy starbase is small to none.
Word has it that the CEO of the Ferengi ship has been busted down to 
``Flea Market Clerk''.
Mr. Spock estimates that the Ferengi/Romulan forces outnumber the Federation
about 2-1.
The Cardassians have Bajor by the proverbials and the Klingons have been for the
most part neutralized.
Our post is secure for now, but without more help.....

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): At least now I know who is putting the Mekons notes into the
press.
If you need the name of a good therapist, I can help.
<i>((No problem on this end, I could say the same to you.... ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): Well this is going to be interesting to see which one of you 
and Germany win. Italy is probably going to get backstabbed by one of you 
question is when. Egypt, Britain, and myself will be eliminated sooner or 
later pending on how we play our moves to delay the inevitable. Then we'll 
be down to the three of you and pending what happens between now and then it 
will all boil down to who gets the better position over who or by making a 
line that no one can get any further.

<p>
(BRITAIN-GERMANY): This should actually be fun.

<p>
(GERMANY to UKRAINE): Help!

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): You know from as much as you feared Jeff and I allying against 
you why force us into it. Lets see here we have Jeff that plays with his own 
twist and me that spends long hours studying the map figuring out what 
would be the best move. Except I didn't do that in Colonia and it cost me I 
need to find a way to pin the map up sometime and study what my mistake was. 
Oh I know I picked the wrong alliance for my power in that game. I didn't 
play well at all I'm down to two and well Austria can have Mel and Sam 
either way I'm going to lose the possessions and I can't hold them and I'll 
lose one at least this year.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): I would never even consider accusing you of perfection.
<i>((Why, thank you, I resemble that remark....))</i>

<p>
(EGYPT-ITALY): What if just for the fun of it, Ukraine and Germany were to
write the moves; Ank-Ist supported by Gre, WBS-Bul, EBS-WBS, Bos-Cro supported 
by Ser and Hun, Sax-Mun, Swi-Mun, Cze-Aus.  You'd lose three guys while Ukraine
would build three, not counting the little guessing game you and I are playing
down South.
Just thought I'd mention it.

<p>
(EGYPT to ITALY): I really appreciate your friendship, but your social graces
are really lacking.
I never sent any letters out inviting Italian troops to Libya.
Your party crashing soldiers were extremely rude and their attitude
has really put a strain on our Egyptian/Italian alliance.
Just to show there are no hard feelings, I would like to cordially
invite any Italian nationals to a party in Greece this fall.
BYOB.
PS: Only if I'm the host!

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Actually we do have Nukes, but everyone has their shields up so 
it does no good to launch though I can always launch them at the GM.

<p>
(O'DONNELL TRIBUTES): ``Launch all Nuclear Weapons at GM"
``But that is three hundred missiles, France destroyed the rest of our 
arsenal."
``Launch!"
Launch in t minus 5;4;3;2;1

<p>
(SEAN-THE DIPLOMACY HOBBYISTS): We need a new GM, I just executed Jim.
Sorry guy, I didn't mean to make Rhode Island a quiet state for the next 20,000 
thousand years, but we did make one mistake we forgot to launch one.

<p>
(DIPLOMACY TRIBUNE NEWS): Earlier this morning Spain launched 299 missiles into 
Rhode Island, but about three hours later Italy stole Spanish plans off 
defense with that weapon and it detonated at their Embassy in Spain on 
Baleria Islands since the war.

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): The Snake Italy, the rat, the cat Germany Ukraine the dog 
Egypt Spain, and Britian. 
How you going to see them when your living in the fog.
Not see no evil, hear no evil, evil.
<i>((Huh??))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): X is coming you can duck duck they don't give a **** ****

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The HJR draw proposal fails.  I'll put it in again on GM's perogative
for a Fall turn vote as well.
If you've already voted, your vote will stay the same for Fall unless
you specifically change it.
Since my reason for doing so will be pretty transparent, I will say that
at least one of you did not vote on the proposal.

<p>
2) Rick is in the middle of moving, but he does have a new address and
there it is!

<p>
3) I forgot to note that the British attempt to support the moving Dutch
fleet in the Red Sea failed.
This didn't really affect anything, but I thought I'd note it.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BOOB SAYS): Very quiet except for some draw votes....
