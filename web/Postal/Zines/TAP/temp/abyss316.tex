I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

I include the ManorCon announcement (my favorite European Dip Event) as Mark
Stretch requested.
It is in a new location from when I last attended, but from all accounts last
year was great despite poor weather, it should be better this year!!!
At the time of ManorCon, this year as usual on the last weekend in July, 
I plan to be at North American DipCon 
in Bangor, Maine, we hope details on that will be forthcoming shortly.
I think Doug Kent might get some more details for {\it Diplomacy World} \#101.
DipCon is supposed to be starting on the Thursday night and going through Sunday.
I was going to get this out a few days earlier, but with ``April 15th" coming up
I had already intended to take the deadline out an extra week, so we were all set.
I've got a host of subszines in here, and I think I'm back on track now.
Also, think about writing press for games, whether you're in them or not.
Let's show people what postal szines are SUPPOSED to be.
Thanks for the born-again press writers, you know who you are, we love you.

%Dave Partridge's unlisted phone number 603-672-2879 -- probably corrected!!!
%Tinamou players: Schwarzschild:  Graham Wilson (NO

The postal sub price is still
\$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or \$3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
\$20.00 (\$15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and \$5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/

I also have taken over the Postal port/DipPouch/Postal

\noindent and {\it TAP} on the web is there at:
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from \#190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
 
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

Peter is now back at least sometimes.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games
and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York and Doug Kent have been my most frequent subszine guests lately!!!
Andy has been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And Doug Kent has been coming out faster than {\it TAP} lately, so
many issues have been having multiple {\it Eternal Sunshine}'s. 
And Michael Lowrey gets his in every few issues too!
So, we have a full set of subszines at the moment.

The {\it TAP} mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I {\bf EXPECT} all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

\centerline{\bf THE SEARCH FOR MICHEL FERON}

\smallskip

Jerry Jones gets added to the list of failures, next up the former
editor of {\it Moeshoeshoe}, along with Michel Liesnard one of the 
founders of the Belgian Diplomacy hobby.
If you read the forthcoming {\it Diplomacy World} \#101 you will 
quickly figure out why I chose Michel Feron to search for next.
There are a host of clues on the Internet that I found, so he 
could be very easy to find. 
Go for it, you have until Issue \#320.

I am running out of people on MY list of who to search for, so
I am looking for ideas, who would you like to find?
Send me some names.
I may go into Jim Meinel's Encyclopedia of North American Diplomacy
szines and find some more szine editors to search for, that's
what I usually do, but I'd like to find people that some of you
will search for or want to find!!!
Come on, help me out.

\bigskip

Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jerry, Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a \$25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original \$50 period.
That means that if Jerry Jones or Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is ``found'' from now on it is worth \$25.

\bigskip

Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for {\it TAP} from the person we're
searching for.

This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.
%Michael Swift, Mike Stewart, and 
%Jason Yarbrough , Tim Stabosz, 
%Eric Ozog has $25
%Leslie Obata is owed $25
%Derek Nelson, winner of the first postal game in Graustark.  I last saw him
%at the '76 DipCon in Baltimore.

\centerline{\bf INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS}

\smallskip

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no
ISE.
If anyone still needs assistance with this, though, since I'm helping
John out, like if you're in a foreign country and need to send dollars
for dipping things to someone in the US, I may be able to help you out.

\centerline{\bf DIPDOM NEWS SECTION (with letters)}

\smallskip
 
Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in {\it italics} and {\it ((double 
quotation marks))} like this.
{\bf Bold face} is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

%A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what 
%stance we (the hobby) should take (proactive in some way for sure) 
%toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
%More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
%have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
%season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.
%No word on precisely what this means yet, could it mean that
%they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?
%Stay tuned....
%If you want to be part of the discussion, send the MESSAGE:
%
%subscribe hasbro
%
%to majordomo of diplom.org, it works just like the tap mailing list
%described below.  Sending messages to hasbro of www.diplom.org
%sends the mail to the whole list.
%The big news this time is the beginning of the breakout of
%Hasbro into official contact with the hobby.

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.
 
Stephen Agar has matched the Hasbro rule lists 
and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

I was going to publish the award ballot for this year

And when I do, I'm going to give out three sets of awards and get caught up for the 
missed years, that seems to make the most sense.  
Committee.... you will be hearing from me soon!

We hope to have more details soon, but I am planning to go and hope
many of you may be coming as well.
Talk to me if you're thinking about it.
I haven't been to DipCon in a few years now, so this year I'm planning it way
in advance.
I hope we get this going soon with the publicity so a lot of you come and make it.
Jim O'Kelley also has been coordinating a number of Chicago events etc.
that are on the web page, go to a FTF tournament near you soon.

\centerline{\bf MUSIC AND MOVIES SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)}
     
\smallskip

We were running a ``23 tunes'' contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented {\bf The Sprouts of Wrath}.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but might next issue.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.
 
%To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
%dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
%a free tape).
%Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
%won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
%That showed the value of getting in early!!
%Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno(\$5), Rick Desper (\$5), Tony Dickinson (\$5),
%Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
%Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz (\$5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
%Round 2 E-Mail voters were Scott Morris, 
%Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
%Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch.
%Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. (\$5),
%Don Williams, Brent McKee, and Andy York.
%Round 5 voters were Mark Larzelere, Al Tabor, Jody McCullough, and that's it.
%We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
%to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
%The result will be a great New Millenium party tape -- we're going for 90 minutes.
%I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
%as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
%I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
%I might by then.
%Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
%be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
%The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.
%So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
%``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from {\it Porgy and Bess} in the 1957 concert
%recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
%Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
%Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
%New York''; something from the B-52's;
%the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
%The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
%ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
%Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
%``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
%and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.
%After I get timings down, I'll choose exactly which songs below make the list.
%
%EXTRA SPECIAL B-52'S BULLPEN: (7) ``Love Shack'';
%``Rock Lobster". {\it ((A tie, a tie!!!!))}
%
%BULLPEN: (9) Nirvana -- ``Smells Like Teen Spirit";

\centerline{\bf {\it 23 Tunes Game}}

\smallskip

Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
%That's it, not complicated.
%I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
%late.
%Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number, scores are in parentheses) 
%is, in alphabetical order, 
%Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper (1), %Steve Emmert, Doug Kent, 
%Dick Martin, %Jim Reader,
%Richard Smith (3), Joakim Spangberg, %Brendan Whyte, 
%and Brad Wilson (4).
%The linking theme thing didn't seem to go over too well.
%No one really figured out the true linking theme.  
%Rick Desper was using Underground tube stops and songs with that as the title,
%they were things like that.  
%I'll let you guys talk a bit to each other on that with your guesses.
%I have added some kind of comment on each tune.

WHAT I NEED: 
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.  
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.
%Rick Desper: Anyway, my tunes this time are "Set the Controls for the Heart of Sun" by Pink %Floyd, 
%in honor of the film Sunshine, and "Afternoon Delight" by the Starland Vocal Band, 
%that Will Hunting just sang a snippet from, and Ron Burgundy covered in "Anchorman".  
%The latter is really becoming an anthem of the Goofy 70s.
%I have no idea what this game is supposed to mean, but we can't go wrong with "Afternoon %Delight".

%\centerline{\bf SPY DIPLOMACY (Variant, revised Dec. 1986)}
%
%by Jim Burgess
%
%Rules:
%
%1) Unless otherwise specified, the standard rules of Diplomacy apply.
%
%2) Players receive adjudications for their own armies and fleets, but not
%the armies and fleets of other powers.  Similarly, each player sees only
%his or her own section of the supply center chart.
%
%3) In addition to the standard units, an unit called a "spy" is added.
%
%     A) Each of the seven powers begins with a spy in each home supply center.
%
%     B) Spies are supplied only by home supply centers (i.e. Russia may have
%as many as four spies at a time while other powers are limited to a maximum
%of three).
%
%     C) Spies are "built" and "disbanded" in Winter seasons at the same time
%as other units.
%
%     D) There is no limit to the number of spies that may be present in any
%province and spies may be ``stacked" with armies or fleets (exceptions are
%listed in Rule 6).
%
%4) Spy Reports
%
%     A) Spies report the location and nationality of armies and fleets in
%the province they occupy and all adjacent provinces immediately following
%the standard Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons (i.e. just prior to
%the spy movement seasons).  Spies can differentiate between units in retreat
%and successful attackers when two units "occupy" a province.
%
%     B) Spies also report the nationality of spies in the province they occupy
%and the presence (but not nationality) of spies in adjacent provinces at the
%same time.
%
%5) Movement of Spies
%
%     A) Spy movement follows the collection of spy reports, so orders to spies
%may be made conditional on any information gathered by spies on opposing troop
%movements or the adjudication of one's own units.
%
%     B) Spies move after each of the following standard seasons: Winter,
%Spring, Summer, and Fall (note that all spy movements PRECEDE Autumn
%retreats), beginning with Winter 1900.
%
%     C) Spies move as armies do with the following exceptions:
%
%          a) Spy movements cannot be stood off by movements of any other unit.
%
%          b) Spies may be convoyed by fleets of any power during any of the
%four movement seasons for spies.  The convoy orders for fleets in these
%seasons must be ordered by their owner in the usual fashion or else the spy
%convoy movement fails of execution.  Fleet convoy orders for spies may be made
%in addition to regular Spring and Fall moves (note, however, that the fleets
%themselves never move during spy movement seasons).
%
%          c) Spies may also be "picked up" and carried by fleets of any
%power. Embarkation and debarkation are moves that must be made during a
%spy movement season and "permission to board" is not required.  Embarkation
%consists of a movement from a land province to an adjacent sea province
%containing a fleet.  Debarkation consists of a movement from a sea province
%containing a fleet to an adjacent land province.  A spy may not "switch
%fleets in midstream".  Once boarded, a spy may only get off by debarking.
%After boarding a fleet, the spy moves with the fleet during regular movement.
%A spy may not debark from a fleet awaiting retreat (e.g. if a fleet carrying
%a spy is dislodged in Spring, the spy may not debark until the spy movement
%season following the standard Summer retreat season).
%
%6) Spy Mortality
%
%     A) This rule will outline the circumstances under which spies may be
%captured or killed.  Spies may be disbanded in Winter seasons at the same
%time as other units to meet the requirement that a power may not have more
%spies than the number of currently held home supply centers and spies are
%annihilated when they are on board a fleet that retreats off the board.
%Otherwise, spies may only be removed from the board (there is no difference
%in the game between capturing and killing a spy, but players should feel
%free to delineate between the two states in writing press) immediately
%following the four spy movement seasons.
%
%     B) Spies killed or captured in a given season do not submit written
%spy reports for that season, though their final movement may have been
%made conditional on that spy report.  Players may never know for sure how
%a spy was lost, just as in real life.
%
%     C) Spies are "killed" by being assassinated by other spies.  When a
%spy moves, he or she may attempt an assassination, specifying the nationality
%of spies to be executed if discovered.  Each spy may hunt for only one
%nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
%will govern the adjudication of assassinations:
%
%          a) A spy may attempt an assassination without moving (for instance
%if the target is in the same province).  In this case, any spies of the target
%nationality that end the spy movement phase in that province are assassinated
%with one exception.  If the spy attempting the stationary assassination is
%himself or herself assassinated by a moving assassin then that spy
%assassinates no one in that season (not even a potential target other than the
%one that assassinates that spy).
%
%          b) A spy attempting a moving assassination (may include a move of
%embarkation or debarkation from a fleet) is always successful in assassinating
%spies of the target nationality that finish the spy movement phase in the
%province that the spy moves to.  This makes "mutual assassinations" possible.
%
%          c) Example: French spy is on board a French fleet in the Channel.
%An English spy is in London.  Both powers specify assassination attempts
%against the spies of the other.  If the English spy embarks on the French
%fleet in the channel (remember that embarkation does not require the
%permission of the fleet being boarded) and the French spy doesn't move, the
%French spy is killed, but the English spy isn't (he may be immediateIy
%captured, however, see part D).  If a German spy is also on board and the
%French spy tried to assassinate the German spy, that operation would fail
%as well. If the French spy debarks to London at the same time, the two spies
%"pass in the night" and neither is killed.
%
%     D) Spies are "captured" by opposing armies and fleets.  Players may
%attempt to capture spies, specifying the nationality of spies to be captured
%if discovered.  Each army and fleet on the board may search for spies of one
%nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
%will govern the adjudication of attempts to capture spies:
%
%          a) Players may specify a nationality to be hunted separately for
%each unit or they may issue blanket searches to be applied to all units.
%
%          b) At the end of the spy movement phase, any spies of the
%nationality specified in the same province are captured (for example, if
%the French player specifies a hunt for English spies on their Channel fleet
%in the above example, then the English spy is captured).
%
%          c) Players are informed when they successfully capture an opposing
%spy.  Note that the "owner" of the spy, however, is not informed of the
%capture.  Communication just is cut.  This rule is the only exception to the
%generaI rule that armies and fleets are blind.  It is possible to play the
%game without allowing capture of spies by armies and fleets if one wishes
%to allow freer movement of spies (i.e. RuIe D may be ignored).
%
%7) It is suggested that the game be adjudicated in four separate seasons
%in the following order:
%
%     A) Spring: (for Spring 1901 this sequence is preceded by a spy movement
%phase (no spy reports are necessary) followed by assassinations or captures)
%
%          a) Standard movement by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
%only for one's own units
%
%          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information
%
%          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4
%
%          d) Spy assassination and capture phase
%
%     B) Summer:
%
%          a) Standard retreats by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
%only for one's own units
%
%          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information
%
%          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4
%
%          d) Spy assassination and capture phase
%
%     C) Fall:
%
%          a) Standard movement by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
%only for one's own units
%
%          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information
%
%          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4
%
%          d) Spy assassination and capture phase
%
%     D) Winter:
%
%          a) Standard Autumn retreats by fleets and armies, adjudication
%reported only for one's own units
%
%          b) Standard Winter builds and removals, also applies to spies
%
%          c) Spy report phase, spies collect information
%
%          d) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4
%
%          e) Spy assassination and capture phase

{\it Game Notes:}

1)  Well, that didn't work so well.  As Jeff O'Donnell had to leave
and I had to pull in multiple standbys, I had this E-Mail from this
guy Heath Gordon who wanted to join, we exchanged a whole series of 
E-Mails, but then..... he's gone.
Back to the first name on my standby list, I'm calling on Mike.
Heath has until the SUMMER deadline to get me draft Fall orders
if he actually wants to do this, otherwise Mike Barno will take
over.
Mike at present is having a problem with his Lightlink E-Mail account,
but he expects to have it corrected by the Summer deadline, so he
should be good to go, and most of you know Mike, I think?
This also will make it a bit of a ``New York flavored game 
as three players will be from there.

3) As a ``very last minute note" I heard from Heath (no orders, just 
heard from him) that he is in Germany on vacation.
If you notify me about these things in advance we can do something
about them....
in any case, things still stand that Heath has to get draft Fall orders
to me by the Summer deadline, or I'll have to replace him.
Thanks for understanding, everyone.

{\it Game Notes:}

1) There are no current proposals.

2) Vern Parker has NMRed, so I'm calling Bob Osuch as a standby.  
Bob hasn't played Diplomacy in a bit, and he reports he's been
playing Computer games lately, but he also says he recently was
perusing old {\it Voice of Doom}'s, so calling him to this position
(which I didn't know before asking him) seems appropriate.
Vern has to get me draft Fall orders by the Summer deadline to
retain the position, if he doesn't then Bob takes over and 
you'll all know that when you submit Fall orders.  As a warning
to everyone, Bruce Linsey is on vacation traveling much of this
month and will not have access to E-Mail, I don't believe, but
he will be back before Fall orders are due.

{\it Game Notes:}

1) The rules are on the {\it TAP} website in the {\it Tinamou} section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an ``efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10\% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

2) Note that Andy York's E-Mail address has been updated.

3) Alex Woo picks up the first points by winning the first Sprint!!!
Looks like the Three Alamos could follow close behind.... 
but they are trailed by Death....
(hey, I thought it was funny!!!!)

4) Dave replaces Rick as the ``low man on the replenishment totem pole".
I carved out some of your comments into press to keep the masses amused....
I'm sure you don't mind.
