I noted with interest your notes on the "Key Opening" which brought back  
memories of a game where that very set of moves was used against me( I was  
Turkey) by Dave Grabar (playing Itlay, what else) and Rich Shatto playing  Austria. 
 It worked very well against me and even Russia (I forget who was  plalying 
Russia) jumped in on the Turkey dinner and I was out by year 03 or 04,  I 
forget exactly.  This was a ftf game we played well over 30 years ago, in  
Chowchilla, CA.  Never new that back stabbing move had a name.  
Stranage how you can always remember the bad  games.
