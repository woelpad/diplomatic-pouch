I probably will write a bit more later, but I wanted to come on tonight and tell everyone that we had a wonderful time today at TempleCon, we played two games, one in each round, with precisely seven players (and me as Tournament Director).  But after playing for well over 12 straight hours, the group decided we are not going to play tomorrow.  And so I need to tell you that in case anyone was planning to surprise us and come tomorrow, don't.... 
 
Anyway, everyone who came except me was down from the Boston area, and four of the players were new (along with our three musketeers of Alex Amann, Jon Hill, and Gregg Harry).  So we all agreed we need to have more Boston area events, including a Massacre Tournament SOON! 
 
Here are the results, including the Detour scoring....
