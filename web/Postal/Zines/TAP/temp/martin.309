ugh! my how time flies!
only have a minute to dash off quick guesses here. hmmm....
i'm guessing that #7 is brad, #8 is me (with the theme being great 
guitar music?), #1 could be emmert. emmert also could be #4 (can i 
guess him twice?). i will guess you as #3. the rest...no clue. pick 
desper as #5, kent as #2, smith as #6 and whyte as #4 if i can't guess 
emmert twice.
the theme for #3 is psychedelia, #5 is metal, #6 is pure pop, #7 is 
distinctive vocals, and #8 is great guitars (even though i pick the 
benny goodman version of sing sing sing i spend most of my time talking 
bout los straitjackets version)
hope that's not too late!
are you arranging the songs by theme or should we try to do that?

Subject: Re: hey!


yes, i have a fresh batch of guesses for you...not that i have a clue 
who's who this time. but i soldier on!

1) ummm...desper?
2) spangberg. i'm sure of this one. unless it's not him.
3) r bradley. who else would use "sizzling" in their notes? not me!
4) smith. maybe. though the "praise you" video is good, "weapon of 
choice" would be my...umm...weapon of choice. it's impossible for me to 
choose a "best" video, but i'll always have a soft spot for tom petty's 
"don't come around here no more".
5) hah! no points for me. i've seen the flowers live two times, once 
great, once not so great. but i blame the crowd for the sub-par 
performance...it was at wolf trap, a gorgeous facility but it was a 
wine'n'cheese crowd, not a rock'n'roll crowd. also finally got to see 
lindsey live on his latest tour & was pleasantly surprised. tons of 
energy and the "new" songs sound really good live. though it's hard to 
call them exactly new, since many of them have been under construction 
for 10+ years. still...good stuff.
6) guess i have to guess you for this one since your comments are so 
effusive

i don't know if i'll ever get around to properly following up my 
comments of a couple issues ago. the point that i was disagreeing with 
was your assertion that our bureaucracy has lost it's innovative edge, 
at least that's what i *thought* you were trying to say. but no 
bureaucracy is *ever* innovative - that is exactly counter to the 
nature of all bureaucracies! also, innovation in this country has 
primarily come through private industry (yes, nowadays with healthy 
doses of government cash). if you want to make the case that our 
federal government has gotten so large as to be totally unmanageable, 
that wouldn't be so hard to do. as a result, it's impossible to be 
directed innovatively by the elected officials (assuming they had any 
innovative ideas to direct).

i've finally moved all my mp3 collection over to my mac and put it into 
itunes - about 35,000 mp3s worth. didn't want to do it, because that 
means now i'll have to rate all 35k tunes, from 1 second sound bites to 
97 minute lectures. at least i have something to do for the next couple 
years. :)

wine'n'cheese crowd, not a rock'n'roll crowd. also finally got to see
lindsey live on his latest tour & was pleasantly surprised. tons of
energy and the "new" songs sound really good live. though it's hard to
call them exactly new, since many of them have been under construction
for 10+ years. still...good stuff.

6) guess i have to guess you for this one since your comments are so
effusive


i don't know if i'll ever get around to properly following up my
comments of a couple issues ago. the point that i was disagreeing with
was your assertion that our bureaucracy has lost it's innovative edge,
at least that's what i *thought* you were trying to say. but no
bureaucracy is *ever* innovative - that is exactly counter to the
nature of all bureaucracies! also, innovation in this country has
primarily come through private industry (yes, nowadays with healthy
doses of government cash). if you want to make the case that our
federal government has gotten so large as to be totally unmanageable,
that wouldn't be so hard to do. as a result, it's impossible to be
directed innovatively by the elected officials (assuming they had any
innovative ideas to direct).


i've finally moved all my mp3 collection over to my mac and put it
into itunes - about 35,000 mp3s worth. didn't want to do it, because
that means now i'll have to rate all 35k tunes, from 1 second sound
bites to 97 minute lectures. at least i have something to do for the
next couple years. :)
