I think <i>Tinamou</i> is on the web page, or will be, but <i>Deny Everything</i>
is still available only postally.....

<b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE IS JUNE 4TH, 2001 - SEE TINAMOU BELOW</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I popped the deadline back a week and that now should be set for the next two
or three deadlines as it will match my schedule better.
It allows me to make this the May Day issue.
Also note that I need only ONE more player for Breaking Away!
Sign up quickly as I expect that opening will go nearly immediately.
Also, Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy is FREE!!!

I ended up holding this until the ``end'' of Survivor, since I wasn't going to have
time to print and mail until Friday anyway, though all but this was done a few
days earlier.
At the end of the day, speaking as a Diplomacy player, I think I have to say that
the Survivor concept has run its course for me.
I still think the basic idea is really close to putting the game of Diplomacy onto
a higher level of interaction with the ``trapped'' playing the game 24-7 a huge lure.
But ultimately, the design of the game fails to capture the nature of Diplomacy in
one key way.
Let me draw a not entirely original analogy.
Imagine that we change the rules of Diplomacy to take away the 18 center victory
condition and say that the goal instead is to play the game until there are just
TWO powers left on the board.
Then the remaining five powers eliminated vote as to which of the Final Two players
is the winner.
How would that change the game??
Well, it changes it a lot, and in entirely endogenous, but ultimately unpredictable
ways.
As one who sort of favors ``alternate goals'' for Diplomacy in general, this might
surprise everyone, but it means that the closer you get to the win, the more you
consider ``how you got there'' and what the players you defeated might think about you.
This makes ``the game'' much closer to real life, but it blurs the line between the
game and life a lot, and in ways that don't bear up to close scrutiny.

<p>
Survivor ends in a win for Tina, something that I predicted (you can check out the
Diplomacy group on Yahoo if you don't believe me, I finished third in the group
for predicting the outcomes of each week's action and totally aced the final episode)
but that I am not totally pleased about.
Because, in a Diplomacy game, Colby should have won.
As I watched the floods of emotional crap come out of the video editing of Jeff Probst
and Mark Burnett in the last few episodes, it became clear that in the end Colby
would also win the last immunity (though they surprised me a bit with the quiz for
the final three, if they had done the quiz for the final four - as I had anticipated -
my fave Elisabeth would have won it and immunity and changed the endgame) and then
that he would vote off Keith, thus ensuring that he would NOT win the million dollar
prize.
And, even though I like to see alternative goals pop up in Dip, as I said, the idea
that someone would (keeping the analogy) Carebear someone into a win over themselves,
when they had the win guaranteed is a bit sickening.
At first, I thought that Survivors were just slowly learning how to play the game,
but now I am convinced that the game will just continue to push further in this
direction for the future.
Rather than Richard Hatch's strategic losses of Immunities, you will have more and
more static, stable alliances with relentless voting off with hugs (the way you saw
Tina especially, but Colby too, do with Rodger and Elisabeth).
This is NOT interesting to me.
I wanted to see dynamic back and forth flows of alliances.
And I just don't think you're gonna see it in Survivor III either.
So, Survivor - African Serengeti (don't know if Tanzania will be the location,
just a guess) is going to have significantly less interest for me.
I think I also am having an acute saccharine reaction to the editing in the
last episode tonight too.
I do think spirituality, introspection, and ritual are extremely important.
Hey, I'm an Episcopalian and that's what our religion is grounded on,
but the sickly, sweet, syrupy way they did it in this last two hour episode
just was so hard to take.
My cradle Episcopalian wife really couldn't take it and ways that I could just
tell were based right there.

<p>
I've tried to spare everyone lots of Survivor II analysis this time around, but
I couldn't resist this rant.
Hey, that's two rant issues in a row, could it be a trend???
Nah... I'm really busy these days but basically happy.
I don't even let Red Sox losses to the Mariners on the West Coast and Pedro
whining about retiring get to me.
Life is good, let's get to the szine.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are ``taking over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
We have Michael Lowrey's <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:

where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.meurglys.com

<p>
The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (in a MUCH, MUCH improved way!)

Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.
I'm not sure what Pete is up to at the moment, but we'll hear soon.

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

Please make careful note of that as well since you generally

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MICKEY PRESTON</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>I don't know much about Mickey, I think this one was submitted by Paul Kenny,
Paul could you write me something about Mickey???
We'll have until Issue #250 to find Mickey Preston.
You guys know the tune. 
I did send an issue to Mark Berch's last known address, but no contact
to this point, so that one goes into the ``backlog''.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p><br><p><br><i>((I started a discussion on rec.games.diplomacy with the following comment:
I have three week deadlines, others have longer deadlines.  What
happens in a GOOD game is that people are more engaged, have more
time to get to know each other and play out diplomatic initiatives
longer.  And that makes the quality of play higher.
I remain amazed, in admittedly relatively limited contact with
regular Judge games, how many people communicate in short one-two
liners.  You simply CANNOT have a high quality of play this way.
I try to write concisely for effect, both here and in negotiation
letters, sometimes but I can't imagine a negotiation letter of less
than three paragraphs (i.e. about the size of this) that would have
any effect that I wanted whatsoever.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Jody McCullough (Thu, 26 Apr 2001 10:51:45 GMT)</b>

<p>
If you're playing truly through mail, then you need these sorts of
deadlines just to be able to play at all. I guess some phone calls are
happening too, which certainly changes things for some of the players
anyway.

<p>
Believe me, good judge players *DO NOT* communicate this way. They write
in paragraphs, just as you or I do. The paragraphs are made up of - more
or less - complete sentences. And they write a lot.

<p>
In a good judge game with good players you get lots of press. Lots and
lots of press. Trust me on this one. It's actually pretty intense if
you're not used to it.

<p>
This is true in high quality Judge games.  The Vermont Group's full-press
tournament is in its semi-final round and I'm GM'ing all three games.
The press that flies back and forth is well written and very verbose.
There were a few exceptions (players that didn't write very much), but
they don't last in the game very long . . .

<p>
<i>((How did ``bourse" stack up against that (my most recent Judge experience)?
Although everyone in the game except the first Turkey negotiated fairly
extensively, I found the interaction good, but far from intense (in a
postal sense).  And I got a sense that I communicated at least as much
as anyone else.  AND I was ``induced" by the common crowd to cut my
intended level of broadcast press to about 1/10th of what I had planned
going in.  ***AND*** in good three or four week deadline postal games the
intensity of the negotiation these days (including both E-Mail and phone)
is on that same level, but with the longer deadline means perhaps three
times as much negotiation per game turn.  Though I by no means intend
to undercut what I'm sure are some great games in the VG setting.))</i>

<p>
The final will start in a month or two and I hope to run it as a 
showcase game - if it has any of the wild turns of the three semifinal
games, it shapes up to be an amazing game to watch.

<p><br><p><br><b>Doug Massey (26 Apr 2001 13:42:24 GMT)</b>

<p>
I thought `bourse' was care-bearish and a little dull.  England stabbed
France early, FG crushed E.  AIR attacked T early and crushed him.  Then
FG agreed to a 2WD and walked across the board, with G passing on a 
forced solo to let F catch up.  *Yawn* 

<p>
The Full-Press tournament's first round was pretty good, with some amazing
solo wins mixed with some indifferent 2WD's and 3WD's that were just 
positioning for the second round.  The second round's objectives were 
just to get to the third round and I feared three seriously boring games.
But it's been the exact opposite - all three are/were ferocious.  I can't
say more without giving away the results (I can't let the players in the
on-going game know what happened in the other two).

<p>
Note that I'm not really pro-draw or anti-draw - well, I'm not a big 
fan of a care-bear 2WD - but I really do like constantly shifting 
alliances and players that will use the hatchet, then agree to bury 
the hatchet, then dig it up and bury it again - in his ally's back!
Some games end in draws when a player sprints towards a solo and the
other players organize a defense.  That's the right time to call it a
draw, in my opinion.

My ``postal" games are all played by email. They differ from a classical 
email game in that they have longer deadlines (my life is too busy to 
have 48/72 hour deadlines), and they are zine based - so I get more out 
of it than an output file from a JUDGE.
 
<p>
If people want to play quick and sterile games then that's fine - each 
to his/her own.

<p>
Quick games don't have to be sterile, though.  It all depends on the
players, of course.  If you have enough Internet access to be able to 
respond to messages within a couple of hours, then you can play 48hr
deadline games, corresponding three, five, seven times with each other
player (although most other players might not require such exchanges).
Quick games should be for players with a wide bandwidth of time to 
write email to their opponents.

<p>
No-Press games *are* sterile, of course.  I use to play them a lot,
but not so much anymore.  I have a hard time keeping my interest up
enough to make the strongest tactical moves that I can.  With press,
perfect tactics aren't necessary; with no-press, there's not much else.

<p>
Fast press games can be sterile, if some of the players can't really
handle negotiations at that speed.  When you have three or four opponents
in a 48hr game who can only send press once a day, you can't get enough
of an exchange going to really call it ``diplomacy".

<p>
I think players should pick lengths of games based not on how impatient
they are for the next turn to process, but based upon how often they
can respond to other players in the game.  If you can only send email 
once a day, you shouldn't play faster than one-week deadlines.  If 
you can respond in the morning and in the evening, maybe 72hr deadlines.
If you can play while you ``work", maybe 48hr.  If you sit at home and
do nothing else, then 24hr.  If *everyone* stuck to this sort of 
guideline, the *quality* of the games would go up, even as the *quantity*
of games goes down.

<p>
Just my opinion, of course.

<p>
Hello Jim,

<p>
Gosh, I haven't written in a while.
<i>((No, you haven't....))</i>
In a desperate attempt to get myself into your good books I've enclosed two recent
<i>Frank's APA</i> szines.
<i>((That'll do it, I'm easy....))</i>
If I'm organised, I might print out the szine I've just done for the latest mailing, 
so you'll have bags of Ian in <i>Frank's APA</i> action to wade through.
<i>((I enjoyed the ones you sent.
It sounds like Marc Gascoigne is still filling up all sorts of efforts in talking
about Christmas songs again.
He went ``CD'' this year, as you probably know.
When you go back over ALL the years, it is just an amazing number of songs he's
collected.  I like the circa 1990 tapes the most and still listen to those each year.))</i>

<p>
I was very touched by Gary Coughlan's story of his reconciliation with his father.
I don't really have much more to say about it than that, just that it is one of the
most moving things I have ever read.
<i>((That's enough, it's ditto from me.))</i>

<p>
I was in your country recently, but probably no nearer to you than I am now, as I was in
San Francisco, visiting my friend Ken.
We (special friend Irene and I) also visited Vancouver, western seaport of perky Canada.
Vancouver was interesting in so far as the weather was very like it is here - 
permanently pissing rain, basically - but a lot of oddly alien features like gridded
street plans and a tendency for people to drive everywhere.
<i>((Yes, but it is a very sprawled out place, like most of North America, so how
else would you get anywhere???  
If I were czar, I would blow up so many cities and redesign them with very different
levels of density, including parkland for greenery.
I sort of like Vancouver's mix of US suburbia, gritty inner city, and mountainous 
backdrops.))</i>
We never fully got to grips with Vancouver because we were staying with an aunt of
mine who kept bringing us to things rather than letting us check things out 
for ourselves.
SF was different, we were staying with a friend who pretty much left us to do our own
thing.

<p>
One thing that was amusing about our visit to San Francisco is how hostile to your
incoming President so many people there are.
Many of that city's inhabitants seem to see Mr. Bush as some kind of simpleton
plaything of Big Business, rather than a noble scion of an illustrious 
political family.
<i>((Well, they do have a point.  
California is 1/7 of the US economy and Mr. Bush abandoned it during the 2000
campaign and has continued to abandon it after taking office.
His aides are hinting that he might never visit it again and that they already 
have given up on winning it in 2004, so his efforts are better spent elsewhere.
Then there is his whole attitude toward their energy crisis.  
Being fair, the Californians have dug their own hole here and I'm sure Bush
is gaining valuable political points in key swing states Oregon and Washington
by his actions, but still he is President of ALL of the United States, not just
40 or so of them that he thinks he might have a chance to win in 2004.
Personally, I think the ``simpleton thing" is way overplayed.
What he is not, in sharp contrast to Clinton, but similar to Reagan, is a
workaholic detail man.
He is the 9-5 President with the MBA - follower of management gurus like
Goldratt (writer of the Goal) who asserts that if you focus on and embrace
the constraints in a system, then managers can have plenty of family time
and work much less.
I have a certain degree of sympathy for this idea, but not a great deal.
The Presidency is not a 9-5 job and thus the President does not have the
command of many essential details.))</i>
I wonder, can any of your older readers cast their minds back to 
when Reagan became President?
Was there a similar sense of ``there goes the country!'' among those in
the more progressive sectors of society?
<i>((What I recall very distinctly now is the year I spent in Dallas in
the early 80's - you all will recall, that is when the ``Jim-Bob'' nickname
kicked in - and the feeling was precisely the same.
There were lots of Reagan supporters in Texas then, much of the same demographic
that supports Bush now, and I felt just about the same way and had the same
kinds of arguments/discussions with people.
What I think is happening now is that Bush's team and society as a whole is
more calculating than it was then.
They are ``paying off the campaign contributions'' with a whole set of appointments
and policies early, through say 2002, and then they will count on short memories
in campaigning for 2004.
Dubya saw first hand how his father was unable to stop negative momentum at the
end of his first term from getting him voted out of office.
At this point, I think even Dubya's dubious (heh, heh) attempt to ``talk'' us into
a brief recession at the beginning of his term was HIGHLY calculated not, as I
first thought, the ravings of an insane lunatic.))</i>

<p>
Did I ever send you a best music of 2000?
Err.... I'll have to think about this.
<i>((Do.
I loved your reference to the Buggles, ``Video Killed the Radio Star", it is one
of the all time great singles.
I love listening to it over and over in the car screaming down the highway (well,
as much as you can scream in a Subaru....))</i>

<p>
Your correspondent Richard Weiss in <i>TAP</i> 242 mentions two interesting things.
Firstly, the Ken Burns ``Jazz'' TV series.
I loved his one about the Civil War, and was interested to hear he had done a
programme about jazz.
On our flight back from SF, one of the inflight things being shown was an episode
of that documentary, the one dealing with Charlie Parker and bebop and such like
in the post second world war period.
Fascinating stuff, amazingly well put together, the kind of thing
that makes me think getting a television would not be a completely stupid thing to do.
I might have to settle for buying the whole thing on DVD so I can watch it on my
computer.

<p>
Incidentally, am I right in thinking that the ``Fast Show'' was never shown in the US,
and thus whenever jazz is mentioned, people do not pavlovianly respond,
``Jazz - nice''?
<i>((What???
You might think that the answer to that is no, but I don't have cable and watch 
very, very little TV so I might not know if it was.))</i>

<p>
Mr. Weiss also mentions some pop-personality stuff abbout some bunch of charlatans
boosting about having predicted Bush's victory.
It is worth making the point again that more Americans voted for Gore than for Bush, 
that Bush lost the election.
I bet that bunch of institutes didn't figure the electoral college into their
predictions, so that's their ``Americans prefer more gregarious Presidents''
clich&#233;s down the dumper.
<i>((The prevailing mood as I see it is: don't get mad, get even.
You may not have heard that the Florida electoral system is being revised
and brought into the 21st century straight from the 19th.
They will be using all optical scanner technology by 2002, just like my
state, Rhode Island has been doing for ten years.
I don't see many people being all that interested in continuing to hash
the past, though many are interested in ``next time''.
See some thinking by me on that elsewhere.))</i>

<p>
I'd agree with Steve Langley that <i>Snatch</i> is a lot of fun, if one 
that could do with a tenth of the plotlines it had to roll with
(or maybe not the incomprehensible story is half the fun).
<i>((I go with the latter - STRONGLY!))</i>
Brad Pitt is hilarious as the pikey prize fighter speaking some strange
patois only tangentially related to English.

<p>
On the subject of films, I saw <i>State and Main</i> last night, a film
written and directed by David Mamet, starring such people as Philip 
Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy, as well as Rebecca Pidgeon (Mrs. 
David Mamet) and Alec Baldwin.
This is a rather fluffy comedy about a film crew arriving in some hick
New England town to shoot a film.
It's all kind of endearing, and while the dialogue is pretty sharp,
there is nothing to match <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i>'s ``What's my 
name? `Fuck You', that's my name.'' surely the greatest line of 
dialogue ever.
It's all very sweet and it reminded me a lot of the Robert Altman
film <i>Cookie's Fortune</i>, which no one in the world went to see
apart from me.
<i>((I would be surprised if Steve Langley didn't see it, not
much gets past him....))</i>

<p>
All that stuff about basketball is really weird - are you sure it isn't
being printed up by some random text generator?
<i>((Hah, hah, ha, no more so than your average <b>Frank's APA</b> looks
to the uninitiated.
I found some of your comments to be close to that..... heh, heh, heh...))</i>

<p>
I must leave you now.

<p>
People often ridicule that habit of east coast types who constantly dream
up new idiotic schemes to spend money curing the world, raising the dead,
air condition the Sahara, and bring about universal love.
It is an easy target.
However, after a while it tends to lose its impact, becoming just another
shopworn clich&#233;.
Then, along comes something as absurd as the front page editorial on #244
to breathe new life into the issue!

<p>
Let's see: India had an earthquake, and nothing has been done about it, so,
let's spend American tax dollars to clear their rubble for them!
I have to do a double take here, since I really have trouble believing
anyone like that could be serious.
A normal, thinking person, faced by someone saying, ``Hey, nothing has been
done in India to clear up their recent earthquake problems'', might well
ask why India hasn't used its massive <b>army</b> to aid in the cleanup?
Or what New Delhi has done to help other Indian states after their
earthquakes?
After all, this isn't the first, or the last, earthquake to hit a land that
has the Himalayas as part of its border.
Is this particular problem any different from India's other chronic problems?
Was this something unforeseen, striking from the blue, vastly outside her
ability to deal with on her own?
Hell, the Indian government itself, let alone their massive populace, is
obviously not any more perturbed over this disaster than any of the assorted other
calamities, wars, droughts, floods, revolts, assassinations, starvations,
riots, and what-not that they face, day in and day out.
If they cared, there is plenty they could do about it.
So if they haven't bothered with it, why should I give a shit?
Well, guess what?
I don't.

<p>
If someone wants to worry about uncleared rubble in Gujarat State, or land
mines in Cambodia, or the loss of panda environment in central China, they
are welcome to do so.
I might even be sympathetic, at least for the pandas.
But when they turn to the US president and give a positive answer to their
own question ``What does all this have to do with Mr. Bush?'',
I will speak up with my objection.
Anyone stating or implying that the government I'm paying for should lift
a finger to do what the Indian government has decided not to bother with
itself, is more than entitled to an answer from me.
Especially so close to April 15th!
The only legitimate objection to George Bush's actions is that he is unwilling
to look such whiners square in the face and give them a blunt, honest, ``Fuck off''.
I certainly do.

Hi Jim-This is for publication, if you want it.

<p>
It is always scarey when someone close to one's own age dies, 
serving as a rude reminder of that dangling sword
labelled ``mortality."  Joey Ramone was only two years (plus change) 
older than I....
     
<p>
He served so well as a cure for Rock's ``Midlife Crisis" that I feel 
Joey deserves to be considered a genuine cultural hero.
Rising out of the drudge of the disco era, he reinfused the spirit of 
roughness into Rock that so pervaded its earliest days.  The Ramones put 
an attitude back into music.

<p>
I look upon their albums <i>Road to Ruin</i> and <i>Rocket to Russia</i> with 
genuine fondness.  
<i>((As do I, and WHAT a concert band..... ears guaranteed to ring for
days afterward.))</i>
These were the heirs to the
guitar-slamming Who, and to rockin' wise guys like Lou Reed.
     
<p>
This time, the new attitude spread from New York to London spawning 
the rebelliousness of groups like the Sex Pistols.  Punk soon evolved 
into the more sugary ``New Wave", but still its rough interior rubbed off 
on the music of the '80's.  Rock was fun again, at least for one more 
shining decade.
     
<p>
Thanks, Joey.

<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Emmert (Sat, 21 Apr 2001 05:24:08 -0400)</b>

<p>
I am attaching a copy of something I ran a while back in an e-mail 
game I'm GM'ing (``My Melon, Callie Baby," named in honor of my daughter, 
Callie).  It's a discussion of my opinion of the most influential 
composition of the Twentieth Century.  I expected brickbats and lots of 
disagreement when I published it, but got none.  Your readers, of 
course, are much more discerning when it comes to music (try as I might, 
I have great difficulty getting these PBEM players interested in 
anything other than the game reports), so this might start an 
interesting discussion.

<p>
In my recent musings over the now-departed Twentieth Century, I have 
considered the most influential music of that era.  There is no 
``greatest tune of the century" to be found in the discussion that 
follows; that's like arguing over who is the prettiest girl, or which is 
the best novel.  Everything depends on your taste.  But in considering 
which is the most influential, you can be a bit more objective.
  
<p>
If you're into rock 'n' roll, there are several choices.  Chuck 
Berry's ``Johnny B. Goode" is an obvious one; it's one of the defining 
tunes of early rock, and remains one of the greatest rock tunes ever 
released.  If you want to go back to the real beginning, you'll have to 
include Bill Haley and the Comets' ``Rock Around the Clock."  After that, 
you have your choice of Beatles recordings; Rolling Stones fans will 
lobby for <i>Let It Bleed</i> or <i>Sticky Fingers</i>; and it's hard to argue with 
fans of the short-lived Blind Faith.
  
<p>
More recently, it's easy to point to releases such as <i>Never Mind the 
Bollocks . . ., London Calling,</i> U2's <i>War,</i> The Police's <i>Regatta de 
Blanc,</i> and even <i>Nevermind</i> by Nirvana and Pearl Jam's <i>Ten</i> as 
landmark recordings.  Each of these was a defining moment in the genre.
    
<p>
But rock owes its very existence to the Blues, so none of these tunes 
can truly be said to have launched a movement.  There is, however, a 
single composition that served to legitimize an entire genre within the 
Twentieth Century, and that gets my vote in this particular poll.
  
<p>
In the 1920's George Gershwin and some of his contemporaries had a 
goal:  They wanted to bring the sound of jazz to a wider audience.  Jazz 
was then regarded as far too lowbrow for any serious composer, and 
certainly not worthy of being played in a serious concert hall.
  
<p>
Then, in January 1924, Gershwin got a call to compose and perform a 
new piece at Aeolian Hall in New York, some five weeks later.  At first, 
he began to write a concerto, but found it too constraining for what he 
wanted to convey; too many rules to follow.  He decided to compose 
instead a rhapsody, which is ``an instrumental composition of free, 
irregular form, suggesting improvisation."  Improvisation is one of the 
hallmarks of jazz, and an idea began to occur to Gershwin - perhaps 
this was the opportunity he and his colleagues had been looking for.
  
<p>
Faced with a severe shortage of time, Gershwin hurriedly composed his 
piece, calling it ``Rhapsody in Blue."  The time was so short that when 
Gershwin took the stage to perform his new composition on February 12, 
significant parts of the piano solos were not yet on paper; these pages 
in the musical score were quite literally blank when he sat down to 
play. 
  
<p>
But play he did, and in doing so, irrevocably changed the face of 
Twentieth Century music.  The reaction to Gershwin's intermarriage of 
the jazz and classical realms was enough to bring jazz into the ears of 
serious critics, and thence into a wider audience throughout the world.
  
<p>
From the roots planted in this concert, we have been able to enjoy 
Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Vince Guaraldi, Ella Fitzgerald, and a 
host of others.  I can think of no other single composition that did so 
much to legitimize an entire musical art form.

NBA: I'm bullish on the Bucks.  I think the East is very weak (again!) and 
the Bucks have enough talent to beat anybody.  The Bucks are 8-0 against
the top West teams, which compares favorably to Philly's relative inability
to beat top teams.  The Sixers feasted by completely dominating the weaker
teams.  I was going to jump on this bandwagon before the playoffs started,
but was travelling.  I would ordinarily worry about the Knicks and/or Heat,
but they both seem to be collapsing.  Well, maybe the Knicks not yet, but I
think they don't match up well against the Bucks.  In the West, look for
the Spurs to roll.  The Spurs ought to be able to beat anybody if they can
continue to get good play from Derek Anderson.  Maybe I'll take Spurs over
Bucks in the Finals.

<p>
MLB: I'm really serious about the Yankees going down this year.  The funny
thing is how BAD the prognosticators have been thus far.  Your typical picks

soon...)  The Mariners are clearly demonstrating that the current salary 
structure in MLB is madness.  They have jettisoned Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey, 
JR., and Alex Rodriguez, and they are better than ever.  The problem is that
ARod's salary really isn't the best way to spend $20 million/year, and certainly 
not when you spread that over a decade.  Who has ever been the dominant player
for as long as a decade?  Even Griffey is showing the signs of wear and tear, 
and seems to be prematurely slowing down.  Three years ago people laughed when
Scott Boras claimed that Bernie Williams was just as valuable as Junior.  But
given Junior's recent production, this doesn't seem so far off base.
<i>((I think an argument can be made that Manny Ramirez might be the
only player of these types worth that much money, and the Red Sox are
lucky enough to have him.))</i>

<p>
The problem with the Yankees is that their age is starting to catch up with 
them.  For one thing, as Sox fans well know, Clemens has always had problems 
maintaining his motivation level.  Just what happened with him between '93 and 
'96?  He's ripe for an off year.  Mussina was always a pitcher who raked in wins 
in spite of a relatively high ERA, and that's not a great sign.  He has some 
great games, but he's not close to the Pedro/Maddux level.  El Duque appears
to be falling apart as he nears his 50th birthday and Pettite, though solid, is
also not a real ace.  People forget in the madness surrounding their World 
Series victory that

<p>
a) they only won 87 games in the regular season last year

<p>
and

<p>
b) had they not stolen Justice from the Indians (another boneheaded trade
by John Hart) they would not even had made the playoffs.  

<p>
The offensive weapons they have: Williams, Posada, Jeter, Justice, are good, but
are not as scary as those in Toronto, Cleveland, or Chicago.  Soriano looks
to be a great player, but they really are an overrated team in general.  

<p>
The Sox have been doing well thus far, and the scary thing is to consider just
how well they would be doing if they hadn't had a few notable bullpen failures.
Maybe after last night Lowe will start turning things around.  They need him
because they really don't want to go into September with Rod Beck as a closer.
This is not a big surprise: Pedro continues to be the best pitcher in the game,
Nomo is definitely back in form, and Crawford and Okha both showed a lot of
promise last year, as did ``Lieutenant" Frank Castillo.  The hitting has been
OK, with Manny ripping up the AL just like we want and Everett playing well too.
Of course, they need to get Nomar back and healthy to really scare other teams.
If they can keep their current level of production from their starting pitching, 
get Lowe back into his form, and get Nomar back and grooving, then I like the
Sox over the Yankees.  

<p>
I see in the NL that the Cubs are leading their division.  Clearly this is
the year for the Cubs/Red Sox World Series rematch of 1918.  You may think this
is crazy, but I'm seeing the signs.  Yesterday I got a letter from the IRS
correcting my tax return, and informing me that my refund was to be over $1000
more than I had calculated it to be.  This is one of those ``hell freezes over"
events which one watches for.

<p>
Too bad Sweet Liz finally got voted off last night, but she's not really in bad
shape, as her future hubby Tim is working out with the Buffalo Bills and her
exposure is likely to give her some ability to push a fashion line if she wants.
(Fashion is such a strange industry it's hard to really predict success but
the shoes she showed this morning on The Morning Show looked cool to me.)

<p>
Being forced off the Filarski bandwagon, I'm finally going to climb onto the
Donaldson bandwagon.  The meals he's gotten here and there, combined with his
natural greater strength, should be enough for Yet Another Immunity in the
finals.  I'll count on him playing it straight and voting off Keith (based
on his comments last night) but it doesn't really matter: if he's in the final
two, he'll win the money.  Alicia, Nick, Amber, and Jerri would all vote
for him over either of the other two.  
<i>((See up top.....))</i>

<p>
It bugs me that the REA alliance never formed, since it was an alliance which
had winning potential.  But I can see where it would not have ultimately 
benefitted Amber, who had no hope of winning under that plan.  If she had
joined to vote off Keith, say, then Colby and Tina would have voted against
her from there on.

<p>
Of course, if Colby wins the final immunity, one could argue that all the voting 
really didn't determine the game.  That would be quite interesting.  Where
Hatch played the game with an eye toward controlling the voting, Colby simply
went out and said ``this is my necklace, I'm not giving it up" and then used
the reward challenges to maintain a greater level of physical and mental 
strength.  It had never occurred to me that one could win using such a 
front-runner strategy.

<i>((But, he didn't, and couldn't.
I expected more people to cite this issue positively or negatively in the voting,
but they didn't.
That shows that they viewed the Challenges as partly being external to the main
game.
I didn't see the Twins coming, but I foresaw
that the White Sox and Rangers would have trouble.  I thought before
the season and still think now that Seattle and Cleveland are
the powers back to be.  Also, note the similarities between
the Bucks and the Celtics.  I am still wanting to punch Pitino
in the nose for his approach.  He wanted to play a balanced team
approach when he had a team of two superstars.  Like the Bucks,
they still have two years of inconsistency before they will be
able to translate their superstar play (needing to find ONE more)
into playoff basketball.  But nothing Pitino was doing could have
speeded that up.  In essence, in retrospect THAT game was over
before it started with the ``ping pong balls" fell off Duncan.
The other thing I am thinking is that it MIGHT be interesting
to see how Pitino would have handled next year's rules.))</i>

<i>Josie and the Pussycats</i>

<p>
The trailer to this one pulled me in.  It shows these three girls singing 
their hearts out to no audience at all.  Followed by a bunch of quick cuts 
leading them to stardom.  I'm thinking that it is very cartoon like when they 
drop the title in, ``Josie and the Pussycats".  Right out of Saturday morning 
cartoons to the big screen.

<p>
In the Comic Book Josie and the Pussycats are crime fighters by day and rock 
stars by night, or sometimes vice versa.  They brought it all to the big 
screen.  An insidious plot to brainwash American Youth through subliminal 
(actually subliminal doesn't quite seem right since there is no visual media 
involved) messages in pop music.

<p>
Josie and Val and Mel singing their hearts out while evading villains and 
foiling the master plot.

<i>Spy Kids</i> ... a movie

<p>
There is a theory that everything happens for a reason.  I don't know if I 
believe that or not.  Sometimes I wonder though.  I had no plans to go see 
<i>Spy Kids</i>.  It was on no list at all.  What it was was the only movie 
showing at a time that was convenient to what I was doing, and it has had 
such phenomenal box office that I figured, `What the heck?'

<p>
Turns out some movie god or other was watching out for me.  <i>Spy Kids</i> is a 
wonderful movie.  It is a total kid's fantasy.  It works on so many levels 
that I am either a total kid, or it appeals to grumpy old men, too.

<p>
I love it.

<p>
<i>Along Came a Spider</i> ... a movie

<p>
James Patterson writes in the Psycho-Thriller genre.  I may have coined the 
term myself, but it perfectly describes what he does.  He tells his stories 
from various points of view.  Sometimes from the mind of the psycho-killer, 
sometimes from the mind of the unwitting victim to be, most often from the 
mind of Detective and Doctor of Psychology Alex Cross.

<p>
Turning a Patterson book into a movie is very difficult in that a movie, by 
its very media doesn't allow you into the minds of the characters.  Given 
that, <i>Along Came a Spider</i> does a very creditable job of doing that very 
thing.

<p>
Patterson deals with intelligent people.  Some of them are insane, but they 
are still very intelligent.  That comes across in the movie.  

<p>
Michael Wincott plays `Gary Soneji' who kidnaps the daughter of a Senator 
from a school guarded by the Secret Service as the first step in what he 
plans to be the `Crime of the Century'.  Wincott plays very scary people with 
just the right touch of humor to make them even scarier.  To make sure that 
his brilliance is understood he invites `Alex Cross' played again by Morgan 
Freeman to help find `Megan Rose Dunne' played by Mika Boorem.  I mentioned 
that Patterson writes about intelligent people.  `Megan Rose' is one of the 
smartest eight year olds you will ever see in a movie.

<p>
Monica Potter plays ``Jezzie Flannigan" the Secret Service agent who was in 
charge of 'Megan's' security.  She places herself with Alex Cross because she 
thinks he has the best chance of figuring out what `Soneji' is doing. Monica 
Potter is all cute and fuzzy.  Not the perfect choice for a Secret Service 
agent.  She tries tough but she is still all cute and fuzzy.

<p>
The story has twists.  Not all is as it seems.  `Alex Cross' still manages to 
figure it out.  I loved it.  But I really think Monica Potter was miscast. 

<p>
<i>((I agree with you and really liked this one.
My wife and I saw it on our 15th Wedding Anniversary night, I think.... 
shows me where my mind is, I can't recall which movie we saw that night.
Monica Potter did some bad acting caused by that miscasting too.
What I don't really get is that some critics REALLY hated this movie
and said it was totally predictable.
I did not find that to be true, it was not predictable to me and didn't
get that way by illogical insane writing.
The story fit together once it all fell into place.
Maybe I'm just stupid and if some critic figured it all out at the beginning,
more power to him....))</i>

<i>Just Visiting</i> ... a movie

<p>
Once again Jean Reno proves that he is the master of any situation from the 
darkly sinister to the brilliantly comic.  Seldom does he get to combine the 
extremes.  He did in <i>The Professional</i>, he comes close in <i>Just Visiting</i>.  
His character doesn't really have a dark side, but he plays a 12th century 
French knight in modern day New York.  Mostly it is a comic situation with 
large laughs.  But occasionally he draws himself up and you see a 12th 
century French knight seriously dominating the scene.  

<p>
Christina Applegate has come a long long way from ``Married with Children".  
She plays the great great many times removed grand daughter of Reno's 
character with brains and charm.  The story is as much about her discovering 
her strength as it is about the Reno's discovering the differences between 
then and now.

<p>
Christian Clavier has a double billing, sharing writing credits with the 
director, and as ``Andre" Reno's faithful servent.  Part of the story is about 
Andre discovering that he is a person in himself.

<p>
Good story, lots of laughs, a villain that gets his just desserts (pardon the 
pun).   

<p>
<i>((Hey Steve, I've generally been loving your reviews, but I also saw this movie
recently (Friday night) and that was Chicago..... all those beautiful
bridges and the Lakefront!!!  ...... not New York (you'll be lucky
if Jim O'Kelley ever forgives you!!! ;-).  And I thought
Christina Applegate also was fine to very good except in a handful
of scenes where she seemed to be watching Reno (who was PERFECT!)
instead of playing her role (I get exposed to too many actors in
person, watching technique, etc. and I'm probably more sensitive
to this than most).
But I too enjoyed the movie quite a bit.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Langley (Sun, 18 Mar 2001 19:22:52 EST)</b>

<p>
<i>Enemy at the Gates</i> ... a movie

<p>
This is a classic story.  On one hand there is the young hero with nothing 
but natural talent, and on the other the old warrior with experience and 
trickery. 

<p>
Jude Law once again creates an interesting character.  Young Vassily
Zaitsev 
is fresh in off the farm.  He is put into a uniform and handed some
bullets.   
He is told to pick up a rifle from a dead comrade and use the bullets to 
fight the Germans.  That was the extent of his training by the Russian 
military. 

<p>
Luckily for all except the Germans, young Vassily was taught to shoot by his 
grandfather.  He finally does get his hands on a rifle, and, under the
awed eyes of Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) a young Soviet Political Officer,
proceeds to kill several German officers with unerring accuracy and no mercy. 

<p>
Danilov turns Vassily into a propaganda symbol.  He tally's Vassily's kills 
and publishes them in a daily newspaper.  German morale plummets and
Russian morale soars. 

<p>
Major Koenig (Ed Harris) is shipped up to the front from Berlin to deal with 
this sudden reversal.  He is the old warrior.  He teaches other German's
to be snipers.  He wrote the book.  He volunteered to kill the young
warrior.  Vassily doesn't even know he is coming. 

<p>
Rachel Weisz plays Tania, a young girl who has lost her parents to the 
Germans.  She falls in love with the young hero, and Danilov falls in love 
with her.   

<p>
Another classic story element.  Envy as a motivational factor towards
doing the wrong thing. 

<p>
The war torn city of Stalingrad deserves a special note.  This was a very
real setting.  The destructiveness of war was made apparent.  Bombs and 
bullets really do tear things apart.  The ongoing battle that was the 
background for the sniper's duel was very realistically done. 

<p>
One major flaw was the total lack of trying to make the actor's accents
part of the movie.  These were supposed to be Russians and Germans.  They
sounded like Brits and Americans, mixed on both sides.  It was a little jarring
to hear Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) speaking with a Cockney accent.  

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mark Fassio (Sun, 18 Mar 2001 20:53:48 -0500)</b>

<p>
The premise of the movie was reported in the 1973 book of the same name,
by William Craig.  Zaitsev in real life was everything the movie made him
to be (and more).  Ntw, he was blinded (how ironic) by a mine later in
the war, and as for his American-born girlfriend....well, read the book. 

<p>
Anyway, the historical consensus is that this event never occurred; there
was no Maj Koenig.  but because of the popularity and ``grittiness" of the
book's story, the Euopean consortium that made this movie (at $85M, the
most expensive joint venture ever in Europe) decided to give this one a
(ahem) shot.

<p>
I'm going to see it next weekend, hopefully.

<i>One Night at McCool's</i> ... a movie

<p>
Over the top.

<p>
<i>One Night at McCool's</i> was designed for the actors to go over the top in 
their roles.  They do.  Liv Tyler, who is arguable the most beautiful woman 
on the planet gets to play ``Jewel" who is wet dream material, no matter how 
chaste or kinky the wet dream may be.  She is whatever fantasy the man she 
is near may desire.  This actually takes more acting talent than any of the 
other actors needed.  The most difficult thing any of the men in the movie 
had to do was walk across a room without tripping over his tongue.

<p>
Funny movie actually.  It was told from the point of view of ``Randy" (Matt 
Dillon) who is an out of work barkeep who has a house and so becomes Jewel's 
boyfriend.  Jewel has always wanted a house.  Randy is telling his story to 
Michael Douglas, the hit man he is hiring to remove Jewel from his life.  The 
same story is told by ``Detective Dehling" (John Goodman) who is telling his 
story to his priest, who keeps interrupting to get more details about the sex 
parts (more over the top).  And finally by ``Carl" (Paul Reiser), Randy's 
almost cousin who is telling his story to his brand new shrink (Reba 
McEntire) who has a really difficult time keeping a straight face.

<p>
Considering the number of dead bodies Jewel leaves in her wake, the term 
``Black Comedy" is apt.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The primary Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings'' rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Jack McHugh claims the Federation,
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
The other races in the game are the Klingons, Cardassians, Species 8472,
and the Vulcans.
We ONLY need two more, let's get this one going.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED and Breaking Away games.
I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.
Breaking Away has Jim Tretick, John Harrington, Rick Desper, David Partridge, and Eric Brosius signed up thus far.
We need six players, so just ONE more, get your reservation in FAST.
Last second news, Tom Howell claims the last spot, I'll announce a game
start next issue, so think about names, riders, and cards.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of meurglys.com
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check your addresses, phone numbers, and E-Mail addresses.
If there is something missing or wrong, please let me know ASAP.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY): Your non-participation was noted by all.

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): Including the GM, who duly chastised the recalcitrant Duck.

<p>
(EDINBURGH CALLING BERLIN?  LEIPZIG?):  Or some other Burg I haven't heard of?

<p>
(BOOB to THE BRITISH SAXONS): I'm sorry, I know Leipzig and Saxony are your
ancestral hunting grounds, but you'll just have to do your own duck hunting.
Open season starts now!!!

<p>
(JODY to BOOB): Italy, eh? I know you said you picked the empires at random
but I still have the suspicion this is your idea of humor. Ah well.
<i>((Perhaps, as you know, I really enjoy playing Italy, so does Don.
Have you been one of the people dissing me over my pro-Italian leanings???
Everything is SOOOOO fuzzy.))</i> 

<p>
(VICHY): Thousands of peasants line the streets as the drums boomed and the 
tri-color fluttered. France's finest are moving south to enjoy the springtime 
along the Spanish coast.
(We sure hope nobody comes visiting in the north while the back door is open 
and no one is home) 

<p>
(BOOB to VICHY): And what of the South and the Riviera???

<p>
(ITALY to FRANCE): I had several reasons for moving as I did. I hope I am
mistaken regarding your intentions. If we bounced in Pie, then en guarde!
If we didn't, then I'll be contacting you shortly.

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA): After the initial flurry, I'd kind of hoped for more
from you.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR KENT SANDWICHOVICH POLLARD to THE WORLD):
Greetings to all and to all a good day.
I hope that all the diplomats that have received my letters will open up 
communications to my nation. I would like to give thanks to all of you that 
have already responded and I hope that good tidings will roll your way...

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): The calendar still says, ``April".  
<i>((Yes....))</i>
The Red Sox won't drop to 3rd until the 4th of July.
<i>((No.....))</i>  
Then they fight Toronto for the wild-card.  
<i>((You mean the Devil Rays are going to make a miracle comeback???
I don't get it.....))</i>
I think the Yankees are really the ones that are, ``Something to be Scared of".
<i>((Yes, George's fury will truly be something to behold!!!))</i>
BTW, the Braves may just have something for the Mets.  
I may have to retract the pre-season prognostication for the NL.
<i>((Too late, I'm sticking with my wimp picks of the NY teams for the Wild Cards,
but I don't think it'll happen for either of them.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Possibly slogging toward a stalemate line battle.... 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(LONDON SEPT 15, 1905): Prime 
Minister John Beale spoke in Parliament, ``England calls for a 
co-aliotion of the united nations to confront the aggression of 
Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire which threatens the stability of 
Europe. I call on France and Italy to join with Germany, Russia and 
England in this glorious endeavour." The leader of his majesty's 
opposition responded to this, ``Does the Prime Minister not notice the 
aggression of Germany which also threatens the stability of Europe which 
the Prime Minister is `supposedly' so concerned about?"  Prime Minister 
Beale replied, ``When the government speaks of stability we mean the 
stability of those christian nations not aligned with a heathen state." 

<p>
(MAR (provisional Capitol)-LONDON, BERLIN, ST PET): I'm keeping the faith 
how about you?

<p>
(PARIS OCT 1, 1905) The Catholic League has appealed to Pope Terence 
I to excommunicate the Emperor Paul I of Austria-Hungary for his unholy 
alliance with the Ottoman Empire. 

<p>
(In the Tyrrhenian Sea Oct 30, 1905): King Edward VII was haranguing 
(now) Admiral Hood on the bridge of 
HMS Indutable(ly), ``Admiral Hood, as your sovereign, I order you to 
transport the Italian army to Tunis!" ``But, your majesty, Sir Samuel 
Owen Barfer (SOB), my commander, has ordered me to the Gulf of Lyons." 
``Nonsense! I am your King. I countermand that order. I demand we rescue 
the Italian royal family and the Pope from the vile Austrians!  Admiral, 
this is a matter of international importance and I take full 
responsibility."  

<p>
(ABOARD HMS INDUTABLE OCT 31, 1905): King Victor 
Emmanuel was assuring his fellow monarch, ``Yes, Eddy, my army can easily 
conquer Tunisia with your English assistance." This made Edward VII 
swell with pride and he responded, ``A `King' must act according to his 
conscience, even if this opposes Parliament and the bureaucrats. It is a 
matter of honour. A King's word, once given, must be acted upon (thus 
spoke the loose cannon)." ``I quite agree, Edward" replied Victor 
Emmanuel (as he had nothing to lose and everything to gain). Letting the 
power of command go to his head Edward said, ``Nicky's (Nicholas II) not 
going to like this but who is he to command me, anyway. I've done plenty 
for him, already. Does Nick, that prick, think I'm gonna kiss Mother 
Russia's big butt? No way. I, Edward, King of England and Emperor of 
India, desire to rescue my fellow monarch, something that `Willy-nilly 
(Wilhelm II) marching to Marseilles' should have done himself." Picking 
up his glass, to propose a toast to their endeavour, Edward said, ``Let 
us pray, Victor, that this works." 

<p>
(A BEACH IN TUSCANY): The pope steps gingerly onto the water, ``I DO believe, I DO
believe, I do....."  

<p>
(LONDON NOV 30, 1905): Prime 
Minister John Beale was incredulous, ``He did what?!" First Sea Lord Sir 
Samuel Owen Barfer (SOB) replied, ``The King countermanded our orders to 
Admiral Hood. Apparently, his majesty is attempting to transport an 
Italian army to Tunis." The Prime minister sat, in thought, for some 
time, before responding, ``Well, for your sake, Barfer, you had better 
hope this rescue attempt is successful or it's your head - you 
recommended Hood for command."

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Thank you to Art Schleinkofer for stepping in so seamlessly!

<p>
2) I think I fixed the supply center chart.  Gene actually had one build
for picking up Melbourne from Sean and taking Sean out of the game, I
forgot to pass the center along.
I notified Gene and he submitted a build.
Also, I tried to fix the build centers. 
I do have the rules on this, I just needed to go through them.
I hope that is right now, again, the centers in all CAPS are the places you can build.
Please let me know if I am missing any.

2) Interesting, Robert abandoned North America, leaving Hank to try to come back
there, while Hank abandoned Europe.
On the surface, looks better for Hank, but we'll have to see.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Quieter this time on the announcements.... thanks to the replacements!!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to ENGLAND AND GERMANY): I have no quarrels
with you. I hope we can put aside any differences
among us and get straight on to the job at hand
- keeping Turkey from winning.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  Sorry Phil, but I had to liven this dead game up.

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): Gotta defend myself before you
accept my predecessor's invitation to stab - if
you haven't already!

<p>
(FORMERLY OCCUPIED EAST-GERMAN DUCHIES):  Germans of all occupations and 
social ranks responded enthusiastically to published reports of a 
Russian offer of withdrawal.  Plans are being drawn up for unprecedented 
numbers of Marine brass bands to be sent to the newly demilitarized 
provinces to lead parades celebrating the newfound peace.

<p>
(NEW KAISER to DEAD OR DORMANT ORIGINAL PLAYERS):  You have enough 
confidence in your alliances and Germany's fate that you don't want to 
discuss anything with me?

<p>
(RUSSIA-TURKEY): Here's the correspondence you've been inquiring about.
Funny how you only correspond through the public press section.  I do want
to continue working with you, of course, you are big and growing.  If I
don't toady now, I will be out.  Let's go get Italy.

<p>
(RUSSIA to ITALY): Hang on! Hopefully, the English
cavalry - via convoy - will come to your aid.

<p>
(ITALY-TURKEY): The winds are shifting mein Kaptain and your fleets
should be blowing Northward towards the bear fat remnants.  A much easier
path to 18 that way.

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): You could help, too. Then
again, you likely have more pressing concerns at
the moment!

<p>
(JIM-BRUCE): My envoys are bringing some fine Black Sea crude to your
palaces and some Norwegian wood to build you the finest of Ottomans.

<p>
(BOOB to ALL): Wow, now I'm confused..... well, let's hope this game is
revived now!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I don't think I've seen so many bounces and cut supports in 
all my life.
It's every man for himself.....
It's also weird that NO one has been eliminated yet, though 
FOUR of you are down to one center.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ROME to PARIS): Looking oh-so-forward to seeing A Lpl-Yor.  If by some
neglect you have not so ordered, then we can have some nice four-letter
Anglo-Saxon words together.

<p>
(BOOB to ROME): I think he found a better way to take BOTH of your 
centers up there....

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE NATION OF ITALY):
Austrian troops shall continue to spill zheir blood if only to keep
your treacherous brood out of Russia...

<p>
(RUSSIA to AUSTRIA): Surprise!

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to ZA WORLD):
Vee must stand together against Italy! Vee must come together...

<p>
(BOOB to AMBASSADOR POLLARD): Others are worried about France..... and other
than you there is not much there there.

<p>
(POPE to SULTAN): Trust me; you will not be eliminated this year.
Guaran-damn-teed.

<p>
(BOOB to POPE): And in fact, NO ONE was eliminated this year.
Surprised the heck out of me.....

<p>
(DEAR POPE): Apologies (as if that will help) but if I don't attack now you are 
likely to win the game.  Plus I can't understand Kent's letters but after 
much research I do believe that he is actually asking me to take part in 
military action against you. So as to not incur his wrath I am agreeing to 
this action.  I still send you much love though. I hope I guess right in MAO. 
Peace out.

<p>
(EMMERT to BURGESS): NHL playoffs start shortly; here are some predictions.
In the west, St. Louis; in the east, a tentative nod to Ottawa.  Blues win
the Cup for the first time.
<i>((HAH, hah, ha, ah, ha, ah, ha, hah, ha..... I'd bet on my guess that
Colorado wins the Cup over both of those....
New Jersey or Pittsburgh look like the best shots to come out of the East
at the moment, but both would be buried by the Avalanche.))</i>

<p>
(EMMERT to TALLMAN): Speaking of Anglo-Saxons, what the hell are you doing
way over THERE?  Was my predecessor - (gasp!) - MEAN to you?

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): That is an understatement.  Note that you had TWO of
his home centers, until now that is.

<p>
(MIKE to KENT):  You declared a jihad against Turkey so that you could 
take Bulgaria.  Now for the time between summer retreats and fall moves, 
you occupy Bulgaria!  None of your home centers, and no Turkish home 
centers, but Bulgaria, your declared priority!  Congratulations, sir, on 
your success.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The RAG draw is defeated again.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Just a ding-dong minute here.  YOU'RE a lifelong Red Sox fan
and I'M the sports masochist?  I would point out that there are teams that I
support that have a pretty decent record of late.  I'd have to explain
football and auto racing to you first though.
<i>((Actually, I'm NOT a lifelong Red Sox fan.  
I didn't really like the Red Sox teams of the 1970's and never had any
attachment to Yaz.
During that period, I was mostly a San Francisco Giants fan.
I've ALWAYS been a San Francisco Giants fan.
In the AL East, I liked the Orioles and I also liked the Royals (from
before they got good!) and the Chisox in the AL.
My first ``favorite player'' on the Red Sox was Dave Stapleton, he who
is most famous for being the First Baseman that SHOULD have replaced
Billy Buckner in that sixth game of the 1986 World Series.
I was screaming at the TV set that my guy wasn't going to be on the
field for the World Series win and then Buckner ruined the whole thing.
Most people know about Buckner, but many forget about Stapleton.
All year long he had been a ninth inning defensive replacement in 
those kinds of situations.
But McNamara wanted Buckner to be on the field for that celebration
that never happened.))</i>

<p>
(AUSTRIA - GERMANY): You tread ever closer to the magic
number, so I've no choice but to trust the Czar. If I
turn to the east, you'll take advantage of the
situation and win this thing. We can't have that now
can we? 

<p>
(GOZ to RUSS): Yes, the ``fan", whoever he is, is still willing to pay out.
Usually anyway.  When he doesn't, and when that ``corporate big-wig in the
rich people's seats" (which you seem to mind) doesn't pay out, then the team
bolts and/or holds the city hostage by threatening to bolt for greener
pastures.  That's part of what I mind.  The other part that I mind is that
the revenue from team to team is so inequitable that it skews the standings
every year.  Haven't you been paying attention?  I'm trying to educate you here.

<p>
I would welcome some comments from Tom Howell on how he won this game.  Was it
just superior tactics, or did he use strategy?  For my part, I have no idea at
all how one would use strategy, so I'm looking for enlightenment.  I tried to
predict how the other players would move and take advantage of anything I could
deduce.  I also made agreements from time to time that I thought would help
both me and the person I was agreeing with (maybe Tom found better ways to do
this.)

<p>
At one point I made an agreement with John Schultz.  He thought I did not keep
my end of the bargain, but I think the problem was that my letter was delayed
in the mail enough that we were off by one round in our coordination.  I tried
to keep every bargain I made during this game.

<p>
Well, same old story as the first game.  Too fast off the mark,
good score at the first sprint line, but couldn't keep it going.
At least there was someone behind me to make me feel better,
but how much consolation is it to beat teams called The Wrecking
Crew and The Flat Wheel Society?  Maybe if Burht had actually
had a bike to ride instead of that keg he was pulling along in
his little red wagon....

<p>
Hey, maybe experience will count for something, sign me up for
the next one if it isn't full yet and i'll try again.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.

<p>
3) Note the new postal address for Sean.

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Give me dark and give me greed;
Give me power that I can hold;
Buzzin' wires it's icy cold;
You taught us well, now feel the dread;
In your nerves and in your beds;
Coming down all round your heads."
That's from ``The Curse" off the album of the same name.
I think I might have used that one before, since I really
like it. 

<p>
(UKRAINE - G/I): If I understand the offer right, I'm to give
up any claim on War/Kra, exchange Hun for Ser and give up
Gre for Izm.  In exchange for this bounty from you (I think
I could probably do better this turn just moving my pieces
randomly, don't you?), I get a share of the Egyptian centers with the
help of the Italian navy, you know, that navy that was down
here helping me before when its compasses got screwed up and
it suddenly thought Cairo was on the Black Sea.  And all I 
have to do is renege on my agreements with SEB and give up on
the grand squeeze on the IG.  Hmmmmm, let me think about that
and I'll get back to you.  Or not.

<p>
(SPANISH MADRID TRIBUNE): Earlier this morning at 5:00 am in Madrid's national 
park of Cita Quinta a massive explosion detonated, destroying much of 
the park's wilderness, as well as a abandoned mansion owned by 
International Pharmaceutical company Umbrella Inc. 
Where a team of U.S. special force teams was sent after being asked to send 
in a team with the World War on all current Spanish forces is on the front. 
The U.S sent in S.T.A.R.S Strategic Tactics and Rescue Squad to Madrid. 
Out of a team of eleven only 4 STARS members survived. 
Their names at the current time are being held by the local police. 
Though one of the surviving STARS members has been confirmed as saying 
that in the mansion was Zombies and other kinds of creatures. 
The STARS member also reports that these creatures were built by Umbrella Inc. 
for bioweapons and for research. 
There is however no evidence released at this current time that the 
explosion and the earthquakes that shook Madrid are in correspondence.

<p>
(SPANISH SVE TRIBUNE): Spanish President Sean O'Donnell and his advisors 
sent in the national Militia into Madrid the night before the explosion 
and they reported that there is some fact of the STARS member has said, 
but how far the commanding officer told us didn't give us much.

<p>
(KENT POLLARD-BOARD): It has come to my attention that people has been 
blacklisting me in this game of fear and whiskey Modern Diplomacy. Whoever 
is black pressing press and useing my name please do try to act like me 
instead of acting like yourselves at least.
Jeff, since you mentioned metaphors, how do you think you sound to me in the 
press with all that Star Trek press. Also I can write in understandable 
English when I want to be able to. Though I must admit I made a mistake of 
suggesting the attack on Alb in the fall. We should have been looking for 
other options like trying to get Germany to aid us against Italy/Ukraine.
Wait and see the next game we play together I'll beat Dave, Eric, and you. 
No matter how long it takes.

<p>
(SPAIN-HARRY): Why haven't you wrote any press lately. Just have had nothing 
else to say??

<p>
(SPANISH NATIONAL TRIBUNE): Spanish forces have indeed broke into the French 
peninsula and by now they may still be there. 
Word is around Spain that the Spanish army is about to grow in strength, but when? 
Though the Spanish president did try building another fleet, 
but the entire fleet was destroyed in a massive hurricane in the south atlantic ocean. 
This would make twice that a Spanish fleet was totally destroyed.
In essence however the cloaking device that was being tested was a success.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY AND ITALY): Well, fellows, if you must know why we aren't 
allied with you is well I honestly can't tell you. 
I felt that this alliance is better and besides Jeff and I agreed long ago 
that we were in fact taking Italy down if we ever had the chance and, well, 
here's our chance.

<p>
(ITALY-BRITAIN, GERMANY): Let the three of us align and little old Sean 
won't have a chance.

<p>
(SEAN-BOARD AND SZINE MEMBERS): If anyone is interested in e-mail Diplomacy,
Ed Prem the Judge of the Statesmen http://dog.tcr.com/&#126; prem/dipgames.htm 
You can get on the waiting list to get into Diplomacy games and variants. 
I have been in several games there and variants such as Aberration, 
Modern Diplomacy, and standard and colonial. 
If you wish to get into the waiting list either go to the website 
or write Ed at prem of dog.tcr.com and get onto standby. 
You do need internet access of some kind to play however. 
It is all done by e-mail.

<p>
(SEAN-JIM): I would like to play you one day since I hear that you're 
one of the top players in the field of Diplomacy and I would love 
to test my tactical skills with or against yours. 
I hear you are a master in defense and that your name is well known and, well, 
if you come into it then I'll finally get to test my skills in a game.
<i>((I know you're being sincere, Sean.... but I must respond....
sure, you just see me getting crunched all over the place so I HAVE to
play defense.....))</i>

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG - ``MIXED RESULTS''): I have once again received interference
from ``Q''.
He cut one of my transmissions in half, distorting its logic.
<i>((What, who would do that???  
Surely not I!!!))</i>
And added his own dialog to a transmission that I sent using a very
old Starfleet code.
Q's addition was to simply restate part of the message using time
distortions to make it look like the message was actually from Q.
<i>((You know, you're working up lots of credit that you COULD
be using to abuse other players....))</i>
As usual, I have no idea what Q is up to and I have no idea what his own
transmissions mean.
<i>((And we MEAN to keep it that way.))</i>
The betrayal of the Ferengi looks complete.
The Romulans have agreed to help me take an old Ferengi starbase on the Kragon
home world if I could lure the Ferengi out of Romulan space to trap the
defenseless lone starship.
The lure worked.
The Romulans have moved out of the Federation neutral zone and I have every
reason to believe they will keep their word at Kragon and return Spock and
Mr. Chekov to the Federation.
There are rumors that Mr. Chekov doesn't really want to leave.
We shall see...
On the Klingon front, the Bajorans suffered a major tactical defeat
as the Cardassians got a front line battle cruiser partially behind
the Bajoran line.
THe Klingons, using a starship built at a Federation starbase that I gave them,
will go to rescue the Bajoran back door.
On a personal note, I hope the Ferengi understand the conquest of Ferengi was
tactical, not personal like the ``Sultan of Kragon" thinks.
On a second personal note, I loaned an old Starfleet shuttlecraft to the Klingon
ambassador on the condition that he take care of it like it was his own.
He returned the shuttle to me, but the front shields were shattered, the
warp drive fried, and the hull had massive impact damage.
He claims he ran into an asteroid field, but I'm not buying it.
I think he took it on one too many unauthorized missions and simply wore it out.
I won't loan the Klingons another one.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY AND ITALY): Don't worry about Jeff and I, we are actually 
nice when we aren't playing Diplomacy and look on the bright side. 
My other uncle Chip isn't in this game, but he doesn't like postal 
or e-mail only face to face. 
Jeff, Chip and I all play for blood so I wouldn't worry.

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Stop with the Star Trek already if you're going to do 
Star Trek then I'll start writing short stories of some sort as a rip-off 
of your press.
<i>((Isn't this close enough.....))</i>

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLE``MENTAL''): I had Commander Data run a long range
tactical analysis of our new alliance.
He says the Cardassians and Ferengi have massive planetary defensive
resources but that they are suffering from a severe shortage of
functional starships.
Long range projections present mathematical evidence that if our alliance
holds, we should kick their combined Ferengi/Cardassian asses!

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN): Nothing lost is nothing gained.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY/ITALY OVER JEFF AND I): Yeah, but tell us how you really feel.

<p>
(BOOB to SEAN): Good shot!

<p>
(SEAN-GM): You are aware that with family members playing that it's only a 
matter of time when one of them attacks the other, especially in the mid or 
end game. 
Besides it's your fault for putting us so close together.
<i>((Spain and Egypt really aren't that close together and yes, I know what
you mean.))</i>
You did say abuse you. I'm used to ragging not abuse..
<i>((Please continue ;-) heh, heh, heh....))</i>

<p>
(SEAN-JEFF): According to what I heard, you should have helped Britain and 
Germany wipe me out. Oh wait a minute you were in the middle of helping 
Turkey at the time my bad. Sorry Jeff I know you had your hands full.

<p>
(JEFF to ERIC): If this was Survivor, I'd say you just got voted off the island.
I can't laugh too hard, because I may be next.
Like you said, ``It's a pirate's life!''.

<p>
(SEAN-PAUL AND ERIC): No hard feelings fellows, but I wanted to test my blade 
on someone's throat, I just couldn't decide who to do it on first.

<p>
(SEAN-GM): Jim you were my first choice, but I can't slit GODs throat of <i>TAP</i>, 
or to Jeff, Q.

<p>
(BOOB to SEAN): Indeed, I should say not, but feel free to try!!!

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN): Fire at Paul.

<p>
(GERMANY-SPAIN): Don't make me kill you.

<p>
(BOOB): And that will be that for this issue.....
