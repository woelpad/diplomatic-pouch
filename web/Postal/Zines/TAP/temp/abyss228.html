<p>
<p><br><p><br>Well, more warehouse style here.
The Worldmasters bit still has me scrambling.
We are a week late with deadlines knocked BACK one week to compensate.
Also Berry Renken is on the <i>TAP</i> Worldmasters team and Y2K problems
have knocked him off the Internet (see below).  
The complaints and delays in the tournament have slacked off at
the same time, but the pace of my own GMed game (including working
in another replacement, the brilliant FTF player, Steve Cooley)
is picking up to meet the March 31st game finishing deadline.
More in the Worldmasters discussion below, but I am swamped (also
with work stuff), so I don't know when <i>TAP</i> will get back
to what I consider normal.
Still, given all that, there continues to be a goodly amount of
reading in here, at least the szine is pretty thick.
And <i>Tinamou</i> is inside with the new deadline below:

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE WILL BE MARCH 6TH, 2000</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.
There will be options for new games from subszines though, stay tuned.
And I am ***ACTIVELY*** promoting Mark Kinney's new postal effort.
See more on that below.
Let's help Mark get at least ONE regular Diplomacy gamestart.

Dave Grabar has the high bid on Pedro Martinez, who is setting a league
salary record, but he doesn't have enough money to keep him.
Someone will bid higher - like David Wang or Eric Voogd.
I'm glad I released him at the lower performance level I had him at,
so that he could come back with proper ratings!
Sucked all that money out of the system so I could get who I wanted.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR BRENTON VER PLOEG AND....</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Brenton Ver Ploeg has not been found yet.
This actually is a search with a twist.  
I actually am offering up TWO $50 rewards.
The first reward is finding for Brenton.
The second is for resolving a certain mystery that currently exists
in our hobby for which Brenton is particularly well qualified to solve.
I will share with Brenton ALL of the information I currently have on this
mystery and he will thus have the leg up to get the second $50 reward.
I will tell the first reward winner who finds Brenton what the mystery is
in general terms, so they will have some advantage as well.
There also is one other person (he knows who he is) who knows what
the mystery is.

<p>
Let's get Kevin, Garret, Al, and Jerry found too!!!  
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.

What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p><br><p><br>  <b>Rick Desper (Tue, 18 Jan 2000 06:24:12 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
In TAP, you ask for some comments regarding the big tourney. 
Our team is not doing so well.  Right now only Dave Partridge
has a fairly strong position.  Richard Weiss and David Kovar
are middling, I'm hanging on after some really bizarre play by
Turkey, and Manus and Paul R. each only have one SC left.  

<p>
I was hoping to have a better position - the game started well, and
I even got up to 6 SCs when I took Marseilles and Spain.  However,
the ever-promised help from Germany never materialized.  I could have
still managed, except that then Turkey decided that he wanted to
sell his soul into slavery to Austria-Hungary.

<p>
At the time he made this decision, Austria-Hungary only had one
fleet,
in the Aegean Sea, and no way to invade Turkey.  I must admit I
didn't see this coming.  I figured most people would hold onto
the three home Turkish centers and wait for help.  This kind of
position is actually pretty strong for Turkey, especially on a board
where Italy has already indicated a lack of desire to try to
crack Turkey.  But Turkey let A-H take Con, Smy, and Ankara all
without a fight, took Sevastapol from Russia, weakening his defense,
helped A-H take Moscow, and sent his one fleet towards Naples, which
he took in a Spring move (brilliant!)  I just got the results back
for the Fall move - I sunk the Turkish fleet in Naples, but lost
Venice and Tunis to A-H and France respectively.  Turkey has one
SC left, Sevastopol, and an army sitting there which will probably
last until the end of the game.  Germany has 11 SC, A-H 12, and 
France has 7.  My 3 SCs include Spain, which is undefendable.  My
only hope is to survive at the border between France and A-H,
and hope that gains me something.  

<p>
I just don't understand the Turkish player in my game.  Why would
anybody throw away Asia Minor like that?  It's frustrating.
<i>((Remember that crossgaming with teams is ALLOWED in this
tournament.
Perhaps it is part of some bizarre cross-gaming deal.
My observation of the play in general in the tournament in Round
#1 is that I have not been impressed.
I expect that the standards of play in Round #2 will be much higher,
at least I hope they will be much higher.))</i>

<p>
My condolences on the loss to Toby Harris.  
It seems he just couldn't resist.
Looking at the final positions, it seems that you had broken through
to the MAO, and could have probably mopped up the rest of the board,
had he wanted to.  
On the whole (and this is a poor segue, since it seems to be
indicting Toby, which isn't my intention) the level of play in the
tournament has been disappointing.  

<p>
<i>((Yeah,  I really enjoyed my chess match with Toby, even though
it turned out badly in the end.  He could have had a 17 with
me in Second place - clearly.  But he took the win.  I would
still make the gamble again.  The speed of the games is still
too fast for me and my schedule.  At some crucial times, I just
didn't have the time to talk things out as far as I would have
liked.  And some of the play was REALLY piss poor.  And my game
on average was pretty good.)) 

<p>
((We have three <b>TAP</b>'ers doing very well, possibly three board
toppers.  But all four of the rest of us are out (or soon
will be).  Warren was killed by the season rollback in Spring 1901 that
was simply mind-boggling to me.  GM control has been abysmal too
across the board.
At least now (finally) some of the worst GMs have been replaced.
But the initial quality control was nil.))</i>

<p>
<i>TAP</i> seems to be well-positioned.  Right now, Toby's team would have
to be considered the favorite, but that can be a downer for his
teammates.  You've got to figure you need at least two board-toppers
plus other good results to win this thing.  Maybe a solo and
a board-topper.  My estimate of the number of solos is increasing.

<p>
<i>((In any case, I won't be back the next time (just speaking for me)
since they will have to SHOW me that the tournament can be
interesting.
Round #2 might be better (I hope).))</i>
 
<p>
I am totally astonished to hear about the rollbacks.  I mean,
I just don't get it.  I have made corrections, but once you have
told the players what the orders are, you don't give them a chance
to change their orders.  What you've described is horribly
amateurish,
and the organizers had better make sure they get better GMing all-
around for this tournament next time.  
<i>((Yeah, and then when they turned some games back, they did
not turn others back under similar circumstances.
Also, turbophreak GMs pushing games forward rather than correcting
mistakes has been a problem.))</i>

<p>
I neglected to discuss Pitt's game in my last letter.   To be
quite honest, I have no idea how he's doing.  He's playing in a game
where Edi Birsan is France, and some other good players are also
there.  But the web board has not been updated in a long time.

<p>
In other news, I've heard nothing whatsoever with regard to interest in a
new zine.  Perhaps I was not specific enough in the previous message about
it, so... I am looking for players for a Standard Dip game, zine to start up
when the game is full.  I probably will give in to fate and again call it
<i>League of Nations</i>.  
<i>((Good choice!!!))</i>
I'd like to run that Global game I mentioned, as well,
and eventually wish to do a really big and complex Trek variant, but the
latter will be quite a while.  I'll probably keep the number of games
relatively low, try to entertain with the news coverage of said games, and
this time around will probably charge a modest sub fee (to be figured out
when publishing starts, but probably along the lines of US$.50 [what genius
took the cent symbol off of computer keyboards, anyway?])
<i>((It's pretty much gone from everywhere, it isn't in the common
character sets any more either.))</i>

<p>
I picked up the Diplomacy computer game for Christmas (getting money from my
relatives is a good thing, sometimes.)  I like it, for what it is... and at
least they have an active Hotseat mode!  I'd love to see variant patches for
it at some point - they have a number on there that use the original map,
but the capability of putting in new ones could be quite nice, too (if
problematic, like how to get the maps into usable form.)  Also problematic
is using more that seven players.  Still, what it is, is pretty nice.

<p>
That's about it for now.

Hi Jim,
It was good seeing your brother for a day at Long Con (Jan 14-17).  He
proved his continued non-fictionality by playing games including
Diplomacy.  It was fun despite our getting each other into a gamelong
jam that made us concede a two-way draw to wicked witches Kaiser Dave
Lincoln and Sultan John Lincoln, who had never allied until the final
gameyear shook out a four-way muddle.  That was my first FTF Dip since
'92 or '93 - way back in the twentieth century when people used
20th-century thinking.  (Or, in Ronald Reagan's case, 19th-century
thinking.)  A good con - in four days I played ten different games,
eight of them at least three hours, including five games I played for
the first time.

<p>
Joy for Frauke &amp; Scott Hanson.  Just e-mailed them (first contact in
12-14 years?) to congratulate.  And DipCorps matters have gotten me
exchanging messages with Allan Calhamer, Walt Buchanan, mid-Eighties
IndyCon host Dave Kleiman, and others.

I wasn't aware of the railroad connection, but it is serendipitous. All
the game names in <i>Octopus's Garden</i> (and before that, <i>C'est Magnifique</i>)
are taken, in sequence, from the list of Vice Presidents of the United
States. Breckinridge was Veep to James Buchanan in the pivotal years
1857-1861 (the timeframe of that perennial favourite undergrad history
exam question, ``Could the Civil War have been avoided?). Breckinridge
also stood in the 1860 Presidential Election, but then who didn't?

<p>
Actually, this is the third sequence of game names I've used. The first
was French towns, A-Z. The second was Beatles song titles, A-Z (managed
to get all 26, with only a little bit of cheating).

This message is meant for all subscribers of <i>The Bluesmobile</i>. 
I'm sending this message on behalf of Berry Renken, who has no email

His emailprogram broke down due to the Y2K problem and he needs 
a special emailprogram for sending email through a BBS. The new

means he needs a new computer first, but that will take some time. 
He hopes to be back in the air in about a month, but it may take 
longer. So please be patient, he's working on a solution to be back 
with <i>The Bluesmobile</i>. For the moment he can't receive nor send any 
email.
In case of urgent messages I'm willing to print and send them by

I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master

<p>
To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
a free tape).
Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
That showed the value of getting in early!!
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson ($5),
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
Round 2 E-Mail voters were Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch.
Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee, and Andy York.
Round 5 voters were Mark Larzelere, Al Tabor, Jody McCullough, and that's it.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.

<p>

<p><br><p><br><b>Rich Goranson (Wed, 19 Jan 2000 14:42:57 EST)</b>

<p>
There were two things I thought I needed to throw out there for general 
consumption. 

<p>
First is a comeback to Steve Emmert. He mentioned in his letter several 
pieces of ``classical music for those raised on rock-and-roll." 
There are three artists who have spent a combined century specializing in just this: 
Wendy Carlos, Isao Tomita and Keith Emerson. All there have made their 
reputation on translating classical pieces to modern instruments and/or a 
rock style. Some of my recommended pieces in this genre are:

<p>
Carlos: Switched on Bach, The Well Tempered Synthesizer, Peter and the Wolf 
(with Al Yankovic of all people), Switched on Brandenburgs and most 
importantly the oscar winning soundtrack to A Clockwork Orange. 

<p>
Tomita: The Planets, Pictures at an Exhibition, The Firebird and most 
importantly the Live in New York disc.

<p>
Emerson: Piano Concerto #1 (Emerson - from Works, Vol. 1), Mars: the Bringer 
of War (Holst - from Emerson, Lake and Powell), The Karelia Suite (Sibelius - 
from Elegy), Canario (the Canario from Fantasia Para Un Gentilhombre by 
Rodrigo - from Love Beach), Knife Edge (Janacek's Sinfonietta - from Emerson, 
Lake and Palmer), Creole Dance (Ginestera's Dancus Creolus - from Live at the 
Royal Albert Hall), The Barbarian (Bartok's Allegro Barbaro - from Emerson, 
Lake and Palmer), Rondo (Brubeck - many recordings, all different), Hoedown 
(Copland's Rodeo - from Trilogy), Pictures at an Exhibition (Mussorgsky - 
from Pictures at an Exhibition), Bach Before the Mast (unknown Bach piece - 
from Honky), Mater Terebrarum (Emerson - from the soundtrack to Inferno) and 
most particularly the combination of Jerusalem and Toccata (Blake/Parry's 
hymn and Ginestera's Piano Concerto #1, 4th Movement - from Brain Salad 
Surgery).

<p>
There would be no synthesizer music as we know it without the work of Wendy 
Carlos. Switched on Bach, The Well Tempered Synthesizer and A Clockwork 
Orange. Her work is the framework for which all others are based. She 
deserves to be in the Founders section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
Tomita is just a damned talented and clever individual. Emerson's quantity 
and quality of work in this field from 1966 to now cannot be discounted. 
These three are the principal masters of classical/rock fusion and 
interpretation. They should not be shoved aside. 
<i>((I generally agree with you and own large chunks of most of the
music you mention.
As I've said in these pages before, I really believe that Emerson's
work with the Nice is his best rock work - I generally thought Greg
Lake's lyrics and singing were annoying though, so surely that contributes
to the bias, and much of the works you cite here are ``sans mot''.))</i>

<p>
Secondly, I have to make an add-on to Alan Stewart's Top Ten movie lists. In 
recent years there has been a radical change in Hollywood. It has 
rediscovered Shakespeare and the epic. We cannot ignore the film that 
virtually started both these trends singlehandedly. So, I would have to place 
Branagh's Henry V in the top ten over something ludicrous like Working Girl. 
<i>((See my comments below on Polanski's approach.))</i>

<p>
I am supposed to return to work tomorrow (Jan 20th) after being off for over 
two months for surgery. It was good to stay home but I do really need to get 
out of here. 

<p>

to publish it last issue, the date was lost somewhere in translation, but I got
it around Christmas.
And we don't hear much from Tom anymore - damned shame.))</i>

<p>
Hi,
A friend sent me a message relating the number of pathetic choices made for
Time magazine's Person of the Century.  I would like to suggest that the honor
go to Alan Turing, whose contributions to the field of computer sciences have
led to the breakthrough necessary to make computing what it is today.  This
technology has had world wide social and economic affects on  everybody (even
those who don't own computers have been affected).  

<p>
At the very least, I'd encourage you to learn more about the man.  There's
some links on the opening page of my web site. If we haven't chatted in awhile, I'd
love to hear from you.  Sorry I haven't sent holiday cards (I'm bad about that
sort of thing and am sure I'll always be that way).

Sorry if I did not make it clear.  This is what happens when you type late at 
night.  TAPMDFRANCE  =  The Abyssinian Prince, Modern Diplomacy, France aka 
Harry Andruschak.  It happened.  It finally happened.  My Brother came over 
and persuaded me to by a ``real" computer.  In this case, a COMPAQ used as a 
floor model at SAMS CLUB, so picked it up for $750.  Bare bones, but probably 
all I need.  Since it has Windows 98, I can play games like SimTower.  You

<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Sat, 29 Jan 2000 11:22:18 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
Let's see...I should try to sneak in a Super Bowl prediction before
the game.  I saw each team only once this season.  The Rams surely
have the better offense, and I think the defenses are fairly even.
Before the playoffs began, I thought whoever won the
Buffalo/Tennessee 
wild card game would make the Super Bowl.  (Really I did!  I should
have written it down somewhere as proof.)  It seemed to me
that the Colts were flat at the end of the season and that
the Jaguars were overrated.  After the Jags utterly flattened
the completely overrated Dolphins, I had doubts, but I was glad
to see my initial feelings justified.  

<p>
Similar teams.  St. Louis has more pass options, but the Titans
compensate by having a more mobile QB.  It will come down to
defenses.
St. Louis made hay this year clobbering weak defenses.  Tampa held
them to 11 points.  While the Titans' D is not quite as good
as the Bucs, it certainly won't get hammered like the typical 
Rams' opponent.  The Rams also have a very good defense - before
the season started many more people were sold on their defense
than their offense.  

<p>
I think I'll have to go with the Titans.  St. Louis really has
not won a lot of games this year against good teams.  In the playoffs
they have thus far faced a team with a great offense and a mediocre
defense (Minnesota) and a team with a great defense and a mediocre
offense (Tampa Bay).  In neither game did they look particularly
dominant.  Of course, the Titans have had their weak moments, too.

<p>
Probably the game will come down to turnovers and/or injuries.
<i>((Possibly, as you know, I really don't care.
I have noticed as I pay less and less attention to football that I tend to
get better at predicting the outcomes of games, at least I seem to think
I do - I think it is about having no emotional involvement.
I am writing this before the game just after you sent it.
I disagree with you.
I believe in teams of destiny - but St. Louis hasn't stopped long enough to
think that they shouldn't be there, so they will win and that quarterback for
the Rams reminds me of the stories of finding Johnny Unitas.  I say you'll have
a game like that famous Giants/Colts game of 1958 or whatever and the kid 
from nowhere will win it.
I really haven't studied it enough to react to your other points and won't
even watch the game.))</i>

<p>
In other news, Vince Carter was the leading vote getter for the
All-star game, proving once again that the voters don't really
know squat.  (They proved this last year with Kobe Bryant.)
Carter is nowhere near the level of Iverson or Jason Kidd, but
since he's young and makes nice dunks on highlight films, people
vote for him.  Hmm...let's look at the stats.

<p>
It must be because the Raptors are so successful, right? Hardly,
they are in the 8 slot in the conference, in danger of not making
the playoffs.  Maybe it's his scoring?  He is scoring 24 ppg.
Of course, Iverson is scoring 30 ppg.  His rebounding is nothing
spectacular.  He doesn't shoot 3-pointers, his shooting
percentage is not noticeably high, he gets 3.8 assists per
game, which is hardly anything, and his 1.29 steals per game
is nice, but nothing compared to Paul Pierce's 2.41 per game.
<i>((Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker are slowly but surely
turning into a good one-two punch for the Celtics, but Pierce
just can't stay healthy.
If he stays healthy the rest of the way, the C's will slip into
the last playoff spot, if not..... nowhere land with the other 
.400 teams.))</i>

<p>
Just what is the big deal here?  It's all hype.  He's the leading
scorer for a mediocre team, and gets nice highlights.  
<i>((Yeah, but that sways votes.))</i>

<p>
Why, then, was he the leading vote getter?  The answer lies in what
the ballot looks like: after Carter and Grant Hill, the next
choices were Marcus Camby and Latrell Sprewell (nice to see
NY voters are still into voting for the home team), Shawn Kemp
(who has fallen off), Keith Van Horn, Antoine Walker, Glenn Robinson,
Toni Kukoc, and Charles Oakley.  A lot of quality players, but
to be honest, the position is pretty thin right now.  Since Pippen
and Chris Webber have gone to the Western Conference, there's
not many forwards in the East.  There's not a single low-post
scoring/rebounding forward left in the tradition of McHale, 
Barkley, and Malone.  Most of the guys above are too small for that.
Walker and Van Horn have yet to really break out.  

<p>
So, I guess I would vote for Vince Carter, I'm just surprised
that he's the top vote-getter.  How can he get more votes than
Tim Duncan? Duncan has to compete with Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone,
Scottie Pippen, Chris Webber, and Glenn Rice, all of whom are
better players than Vince Carter.  Oh well, that's why they call
it <i>voting</i>.

<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Emmert (Mon, 31 Jan 2000 12:11:37 -0500)</b>

<p>
I have looked over my proposed party tape yet again, and think I need to
remove the Tchaikovsky piece.  The other classical tunes are rockin' (as
classical music goes), while ``The Waltz of the Flowers" plays at a
different speed entirely.  The remaining classical tunes are all pieces
that inspire me to crank the volume, not unlike hearing certain Van
Halen tunes, but in a slightly different manner.

<p>
I do not mean to say that these are the best classical music pieces.
(For example, there's no Puccini, who wrote what's considered by many
listeners to be the most beautiful operatic music.  Beethoven's Symphony
No. 5 isn't in there, despite its high regard and popularity.  And my
personal favorite composer, Debussy, isn't there at all.)  It's just
music that I think could sustain a party.  Imagine when ``The Ride of the
Valkyries" comes on:  How many guys at the party will say, ``I love the
smell of napalm in the morning"?

<p>
Yes, I think I would sequence it in that fashion, letting the genres
flow into one another.  I once made a tape that deliberately flouted any
such convention.  As I recall, the first side was:

<p>
``The Magnificent Seven" by the Clash

<p>
``You Are in My System" by Robert Palmer

<p>
``Arrested for Driving While Blind" by ZZTop

<p>
``Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry

<p>
``Freedom of Choice/Whip It" by Devo (now, there's a segue for you!)

<p>
``New Frontier" by Donald Fagen

<p>
``Stepping Razor" by Peter Tosh

<p>
``Dream Home in New Zealand" by The Beat
<i>((I'm gonna have to go listen to that song again, I never thought it had 
ANYTHING on ``Save It For Later''.....))</i>

<p>
``Voodoo Chile" by Jimi Hendrix

<p>
Nothing was sacred; you'll note that I followed New Wave (Devo) with
Technopop, Reggae, Ska, and Rock.  For the casual listener, it was too
much gear-changing, although I loved it.

<p>
Had a great time last evening watching ``The Quiet Man" with Sondra and
our neighbors while our kids demolished Caroline's room upstairs.  Am I
the only guy here who ignored the Super Bowl last night?  I hear it was
a good game, but am none the worse for having not known who won until
this morning.  For REAL sports, the important news is that pitchers and
catchers report in TWO WEEKS!!  Jim-Bob, we have almost made it through
the winter!  The first harbinger of the approach of spring is the sound
of soft-toss as a prelude to ffffffffffff-BAM! (Randy Johnson's fastball)

<p>
<i>((Got it.  
Pitchers and catchers.... can't wait, especially with the Red Sox to
root for!!
Charlotte and I rented Polanski's <b>Macbeth</b>, which we'd never
seen.   It holds up surprisingly well.  It's really good.  I am not
a fan of ``The Quiet Man'', but I hope you enjoyed it.
The only scene in <b>Macbeth</b> that ``dropped out'' of the movie was
Francesca Annis' famous nude soliloquy on ``Out, out, damned spot''
as Lady Macbeth.
You remembered why Hugh Hefner was the Executive Producer.
But the nude witches were just right and a total delight of
wonder and nonsense (nude old hags are not sexy) and
the gore (crossbow arrows through foreheads and the like) was
not as bad as I was expecting.
And the edits and focus of the movie were absolutely perfect.
It really is a great movie.))

<p>
((Charlotte and I (this should interest you and Sondra) then turned
on Public TV and saw three new one act operas about Central Park.
The first was written by Wendy Wasserstein and was hilarious!
Tremendous.  The second was written by A.R. Gurney (of Love Letters
fame) and that was cute - a little too cute, with a John Lennon
theme.  And the third was by Terence McNally (who wrote Master Class)
and was nearly unwatchable - I'm sure quality determined the order
they were shown.  Lots of ``in'' jokes, including sub-titles for
the English words which were not needed.))

<p>
((I also didn't find out who won the Super Bowl until this morning,
though we watched the news after that, all we saw were teasers
about who won.))</i>

<p>
Looks like Team Arsenic will have a hard time placing well in the World

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I am open to suggestions on the latter, though I want to print maps and
***I*** don't know how to make the rings rotate easily.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has taken the sixth spot.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this very soon,
we now need only TWO more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.  
If you are interested, contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to ITALY): I bet you'd just love to have a long enough blade.

<p>
(SEVASTOPOL): The Tzar reminds the Sultan that he has boldly gone where no man 
has gone before, and is therefore to be beheaded in the presence of his 
harem.  Now, Sir, would you like to vacate the Black Sea now?

<p>
(LONDON, OCT. 31, 1901): King George V has been assured by the first
Sea Lord of the Admiralty, Samuel Owen Barfer (S.O.B.) [which is no
assurance at all], that the Royal Navy will defend England's possessions
of Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean.
Barfer went on to say, ``Your Majesty, if it's not HMS Kipper then
we have HMS Codpiece, er, HMS Codfish at the ready.''

<p>
(DAN GORHAM): Hi Guys:
I don't make New Year's resolutions anymore. I'm old enough to know better.
For the most part they're broken before the hangover is gone, which is
particularly troubling to those who annually resolve to cut back on the
drinking.
We've heard them all: Lose weight. Take better care of yourself. Make new
friends. Find a faithful companion. Get more exercise. Take in a lost soul.
Get to know your neighbors.
I have a better one, and it covers all the resolutions above.
GET A DOG!
Just go to the pound and get a dog.
Oh, I can hear what you're saying right now. ``The last thing  I need in my
life right now is a dog."
You're wrong!
It's the first thing you need.
Too busy? Too busy for what? A litle more love in your life? Maybe that's
your problem. Maybe you're been looking for love in all the wrong places. A
dog will treat you better than anyone you'll meet at happy hour. Trust me.
I've been to happy hour.
In a perfect world, every dog would have a home and every home would have a
dog. And believe me, it would be a better world.
If President Clinton had gotten his dog a bit sooner than he did, he might
not be in the mess he's in today. Dogs protect their owners from every kind
of trouble, including themselves.
Besides, they're a lot cheaper than mistresses.
Yes, dogs are responsibilities, but what's wrong with a little
responsibility? FDR had time for Fala, his Scottie, and he was running a
country at war.
Yes, you have to walk them, but what's wrong with a walk every morning?
Built-in exercise.
Yes, you have to plan for their care when you go away. So? As any dog owner
will tell you, it's a small price to pay for total devotion.
Get a dog.
You'll get more kisses than you ever imagined. You'll never be lonely
again. You'll always have someone to talk too. Dogs are great listeners.
Some of the best conversations I've ever had have been with my dog `Rocky'.
The whole tenor of your life will change - from the smell of the dog's
warm
breath on your face as he or she stands by your bed, silently announcing
the beginning of your day, to the sound of four feet galloping down the
hallway when you put the key in the door of your house. These are good
things. Again, trust me.
A dog will quickly turn you into a fool, but who cares? Better your dog
than your boss. I'm a fool for my dog and proud of it.
You will live longer. Your house will be dirtier, but your blood pressure
will be lower.
You will laugh more. Both at yourself and at your dog.
You will increase your circle of friends. ``Dog people" will enter your
life. This, too, is good.
Even in the most workaholic cities the dog people have their priorities
straight. They know work can wait another 30 minutes. There are more
important things to do.
Like throwing sticks.
Who would you rather spend time with? A dog or a politician? Case closed.
You see things differently with a dog at your side.
Like life.
Dogs stop and smell the bushes. They give tours of back alleys and
neighborhood lanes you never knew existed. They make you linger.
Dogs are better than children. Even my friends with children say that. As a
dog friend of mine likes to say, children are for people who can't have
dogs.
Dogs rarely talk back, their education costs less, they come with their own
clothes, and they always eat what they're served. Plus, dogs appreciate
every last thing you do for them.
So how about it?
It's a new year, a new century.
Get a new life.
Get a dog.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Karl Schuetz also has dropped his position in the game that 
Michael Lowrey is running, so we must presume that he is a bit
too busy to play.
I call Sean to take over as the last standby for Colonia that I have.
I enclose the full maps to Sean with this issue.

<p>
2) Check all of the adjudications and the Supply Center Chart.
I will be surprised if I got it all right, but you will correct me.
Anyone who would like to figure out how many neutrals are still left
and what they are would be appreciated.
I didn't have time to do that again.
I'm sticking with the ``map with Spring and Fall orders, SC chart with every turn,
orders written out in full'' adjudication style.
You'll let me know if you have any problems with it.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BORDEAUX):
Many citizens have been complaining about an awful smell drifting up from
the south. Further study revealed that it was the Portuguese army camped out
in the Spanish province of Leon. So in a good neighborly attitude the French
Corp du Sud was dispatched to remove the army from the province and restore
order to the region.

<p>
(SPAIN to GM): I understand.  I actually started by reducing
the big map, but then Europe was so small relatively that
it didn't work at all, so I redrew things.  Sometime, when
I have some more spare time, I'll give a shot at a more
useable but less proportional version.

<p>
(ST NICOLAS):
The sight of the new city is occupied by the grotesques offspring of what
can best be guessed at as Portuguese women and Sasquatch. These creatures
are large and simple looking (probably from the Sasquatch side) and have
prodigious facial hair (probably from the Portuguese side). Luckily they are
too stupid to operate fire arms and should be eradicated fairly easily.

<p>
(OTTO - RUSSIA): You may find the price for your greed more heavy 
than you can bear.

<p>
(MOSCOW to OTTOMAN):   This fuss is all over a province that you couldn't 
even get to?

<p>
(MAJOR ANARCHY to GENERAL CHAOS): Spread the word brother!

<p>
(TRENT-HOBBY): So, Dipdom has survived Y2K.... along with everything
else.
May we laugh at the people who built bomb shelters now?
<i>((Oh, probably, but I beg to differ.
Dipdom has NOT survived Y2K intact until our beloved Berry Renken
is returned to us!
Read his proxy story above.

<p>
(BOOB to SECRETS DENIZENS): I hope the game delay cleans up some 
of that for you guys.  I know with England in Australia and the break
of mail only players here, things have been tight.  If everyone wanted
me to, I could slow the game down by skipping my szine deadlines here
and there if you like.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Quiet summer season....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FRANCE to GERMANY):  I suppose I can't dissuade you from F Hol S A
Ruh-Bel?

<p>
(MIKE to JODY):  Applause on your timely salvo of 4 warheads upon our
esteemed GM.

<p>
(SARA REICHERT-JIM BURGESS): The Italian Army in Tuscany is the one 
that can traverse the most black holes, but that is only NINE (9) of 
them; Tuscany-Piedmont-Venice-Rome-Naples-Tyrrhenian Sea-Tunis-West 
Med-Spain-Portugal only to wind up facing the Mid Atlantic Ocean.   
Hardly worth the bother.  The French army in Gascony can use the black holes to 
assist Austria in removing Italy from Trieste.  Italy can use the black holes 
to capture Marseilles, no matter what defense France tries.   Russia can use 
the black hole of Moscow to defend Sevastopol from the Turks.  The black hole 
in Galicia can be used by Austria against Italy's army in Trieste.  The black 
holes on and around England have no use for Fall 1904.

<p>
(MIKE to SANDY):  I refer you to Sara's press regarding black press:
someone else is doing the literary self-gripping.  What does ``putting
four digits into your date" [that's ``Y2K<b><i>Y</i></b> Jelly"] have
to do with it?

<p>
(CZAR-KAISER): As you are black, Happy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

<p>
(CZAR-ARCHDUKE): As you are red, Happy Valentine's Day.

<p>
(CZAR-HEATH): As you are dead, Happy Mortician's Day.

<p>
(CZAR-SULTAN): We already know you are yellow, so Happy T-Day.

<p>
(CZAR-JIMBOOB): I'm dreaming of a white christmas, # 1 sold song of all time.
Why isn't it on the party tape list?  It's a classic?
<i>((Please.... Please.... ``Just Shoot Me!''))</i>

<p>
(SARA-BLACK PRESSER): If you are bringing up the subject of circumcision, I 
am against it.  Rather then go into details, I simple refer you to some of 
the following web sites:
www.mothersagainstcirc.org,
www.sexuallymutilatedchild.org,
www.nocirc.org,
www.noharmm.org,
www.informedconsent.org,

<p>
 all of which have numerous links to other sites.  

<p>
(CZAR-DOCTOR MIKE):  You and Dr. Laura used to play doctor together?  And she
has pictures on the web of her nakedness?  This I wanta see.
<i>((The question of the hour, then, is ``Has Dr. Laura been 
circumcised?''))</i>

<p>
(SARA REICHERT-WORLD): My apologies to all who tried to e-mail me at my 
former NetZero account.  I am now at Sarareichert of aol.com

<p>
(GUYS-DOLLS):  More banana talk, please.  I beg you.

<p>
(M.P. BARNO, Maniac for Pizza to HEATH):  I refer you to Sara's press
regarding black press:  someone else has a Mobius strip for a thought
process.

<p>
(MARKOFF CHANEY IV to HAGBARD CELINE):  Anthrax?  A mere hoax.  A
satisfactory biological agent was not attained until Anthrax Leprosy Mu.

<p>
(PALACE OF SUPPORT AND HOPE to FLASHMAN):  That was, um, an intentional
misorder, wasn't it?  You're going to, uh, snag an Austrian dot, get a
build, and, er, support yourself into another Austrian center as he,
mmm, collapses?  Am I guessing right?  Or am I urinating into the wind
with this optimistic hypothesis?

<p>
(ANKARAN GEOSTRATEGY CENTER to BESOTTED EMPEROR IN A SYPHILITIC
WHOREHOUSE NEAR VIENNA):  You continue to harbor an utterly unrealistic
fantasy of conquering the Anatolian peninsula.  I say, dream on!  Follow
your dreams wherever they may take you.  Like Syria... Livonia...
Prussia... Give no thought to other games where any power might have
gone from six centers to zero at once.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Interesting position, lots of movement, bounces, and attacks!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to TURKEY): Hang on there.  I know it is the usual problem of too
little too late, but you never know.

<p>
(GERMANY (in his best Daffy Duck impersonation) to AUSTRIA): Of course you
know, this means war.

<p>
(JAMES to GERMANY / AUSTRIA / RUSSIA / ITALY): I imagine that there was a lot
of praying to the gods of chance over the holidays.  Who guessed right?

<p>
(LONDON to MADRID): Still hanging around - who would have thought. Won't be
much longer now.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): I'll swing you a deal:  I won't comment on something that I
don't understand, like basketball, and you don't comment on something you
don't understand, like football.  Ugh!  I can't believe my Colts couldn't
run the ball against the Titans!             
<i>((Believe me, I'll be MORE than happy not to comment about football.
What did I say???
I'd MUCH rather talk about basketball, or that Pitchers and Catchers is
only a short time away!
Whoops, I forgot, your teams in Baseball are already out of it before
Spring Training even starts.
Well, mine isn't.
Us Red Sox fans have lots of questions and lots of hopes.....
the wild card or better is ours for the taking.))</i>

<p>
(UPSTATE NY to WORLD): College football season is over at last - even SU won
in the Toilet Bowl played in Nashville.  Now we can concentrate on the
college basketball - the only sport that really matters.  As I write this in
early January, Syracuse is ranked #7 in the country, but hasn't played
anyone good yet or even a single road game.  Are they still in the polls
now?  Steve - SU finally paid back those pesky Spiders.
<i>((As of this writing, they are STILL unbeaten, and now have beaten
UConn, a feat worth noting.
Around these here parts, all the teams are really, really awful right
now, even UConn is a bit off in losing some games.
They'll get it right again against our local Providence Friars later
this week....
but there's always the Lady Huskies!!
They are great as my favorite player, Shea Ralph, has learned that there
is no ``I'' in ``TEAM'' and is playing really great!!))</i>

For me, this game is entirely tactical at this point.  I'm sure there must
be strategy to the game, but it still escapes me.
Still, I had fun and maybe my tactics will work better in the new game.  
Congratulations to Rick for his win, and thanks to Jim and the other players
for the game.

<p>
All the riders samba across the finish line, and meet Kenny, who
stops watching Dad's porn videos before he goes blind.

<p>
Chef's EOG: well, it's pretty obvious what the biggest factor for
the South Park team was.  (Everybody slaps Kenny on the back).
No, not Kenny, these rocket boosters.  Thanks, Satan!  
Seriously, the breakaway was the big thing.  I'd though earlier that
Meg was going to do it at the start.  I even said ``thought you
were going to do a Prefontaine there, Meg".  Sure, an obscure comment
Dennis Miller would be proud of.  Steve Prefontaine was a famous
distance runner in the early 70s who ran his races by leading 
from start to finish.  It was clear to me with the breakaway rules
that whoever got a huge lead would probably race away with the
points.
When Meg didn't do it, I kept waiting for a chance.  First, the
Stooges cashed in at the first spring, due largely to the fact they
profited most by our 4-way deal at the beginning to strand the
game designer.  (heh heh)  Everybody but the Flat 
Wheelers were in on that one.  Still, we screwed it up since we
made a huge block not realizing the riders in the block would also
be penalized!  D'oh!

<p>
[Homer - Chef: that's my line, yours is ``hi kids, how are my
little crackers today'']

<p>
[Chef - Homer: sorry]

<p>
Chef: (continues) Anyway, after the first sprint, the Stooges were
rolling in gravy, but they were stuck with really bad cards, and
the rest of us could draft them.  We made one more deal with the
Bunnies which got both of us a bunch of good cards.  After that
it was mostly looking for opportunities.  Kenny had his breakout,
and we were able to keep the rest of the kids close enough together
to protect against a dropout.  

<p>
We worried a lot about the Brits in the middle of the game, but
he made a strange move chasing down Kenny.  He did it too late
to actually catch the squirt, but probably should have just let
Kenny go by then, instead of wasting his best cards.  The Brits
got strung out after the second sprint just like the Stooges after
the first, and the Flat Wheelers and the Goz team were having
major problems with drops.  That left the Bunnies, who put together
a much better finish than we'd expected.  Well done!  Only
through the miracle of Alien Intervention were we able to eek out
a win.  Thank you, Visitors!

<p>
Incidentally, I was finally able to see the South Park Film over
Xmas.  Great stuff!  Singing the songs all the time.  And remember,
even though they gave us Celine Dion and William Shatner, it's not
fair to blame Canada for everything.  Sure they all have beady
eyes and flapping heads, but they're people, too!

<p>
Happy New Year!  OK, kids, it's time to go back to Java.  That
exciting(yawn!) Colonial game needs a bit more attention.

<p>
Finally, Chef's Top 10 movies of the '80s

<p>
10. The Year of Living Dangerously (1982) -  Chef lives dangerously
every year!

<p>
9.  An Officer and a Gentleman (1983) -  Love lifts Chef up
where he belongs!  

<p>
8.  Lethal Weapon (1987) - Chef <i>is</i> a lethal weapon!

<p>
7.  The Witches of Eastwick (1987) - any man who can hook up with
Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer is OK with Chef!

<p>
6.  Sophie's Choice (1982) - Sophie chose Chef, of course.
<i>((That was so disgusting, it was almost funny - typical of Chef.))</i>

<p>
5.  E.T. (1982) - Visitors!!
<i>((Ship 'em outta here, my least favorite big movie of the 80's!))</i>

<p>
4.  Brazil (1985) - they got some fine lookin' women in Brazil!

<p>
3.  The Big Chill (1982) - Chef gets big chills when he thinks about
Pam Grier.
<i>((Huh?!
What about Mary Kay Place, I think she is REALLY hot....))</i>

<p>
2.  Jackie Brown (1997) - I don't care if it was 8 years too late, Pam
Grier is ALL woman!
<i>((Oh?!))</i>

<p>
1.  She's Gotta Have It(1986) - Spike Lee's first big success.  Do you
have to ask Chef why?

First off, thanks to Jim-Bob for running this one.
As for my play, I had an ok opening, a really bad middle game, and then did
pretty well late.  4th is about where I deserved to be.  There were a lot of
nuances in positioning that I never did pick up.  Nonetheless, I had a great
time.  Great press all along from everyone.  Every game should be like this
one.  Congrats to Rick and all the Crackers, as the win was well deserved.
I'll make sure and kill Kenny earlier next time.  Good job John, John, Dave
and Eric.  Play again?

Well, not much to say here.  I peaked early and won the
first sprint hands down, but my attempts to recharge
failed and that was that.  Hanging on for third wasn't
too bad.  There were a couple of places where a different
guess or a slightly different configuration could have
gotten me some cards and I might have held on, but that's
the way the wheel rolls.
I had the most fun on the first round when I organized the
small gap that meant that John's riders hanging back
on the first spaces didn't get decent cards.  A diplomatic
triumph even if the racing didn't hold up.

<p>
1) Everything finished up as we stated last time.
There are a few end game comments that I stuck in above, and 
I think John owes a copy of Breaking Away to Rick Desper!
This game goes out of the szine next issue, unless there are any follow
up comments.
Usually, I mention that players leaving the szine need to make arrangements
if they want to keep getting this, but everyone here is all set in some
capacity to keep receiving the szine.
Thanks for playing, I ***REALLY*** enjoyed it!!!

(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO., QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO.,
INC.): Acquisitions went better than expected, as we only thought we'd get
6th &amp; 8th, then looked closer and thought it was 7th &amp; 8th, then found that
it was actually 6th &amp; 7th.  So the shareholders have been fooled all along,
the executives have been given golden parachutes worth millions and will all
get executive positions elsewhere, and we file for bankruptcy reorganization.

1) I think I got that adjudication right.
I was a little confused how we pick up after the overcrowding on 6 and 7.
In OUR rules, we treat the square in FRONT of the overcrowded square as empty. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MARK-FIELD):  It is often observed that my gospel is marked by haste.
It is by far the shortest of the gospels, and the word ``immediately''
appears in it frequently.  There's a lot of action, but not as much talk 
as in the other gospels.  Hence, I'm going to start off with a `6' instead
of a `4'.  Who wants to hang around playing small cards?

<p>
(DARRELL B to WHOMEVER'S NEXT TO HIM): That's my brother
Darrell back there.  Behind him's my other brother
Darrell.  Then there's Buhrt.  He put the Maine in
maniacal.  Don't get in his way when he gets going.

<p>
(ANDY-GM):  Just a reminder that now that I have e-mail, I am willing to be a
standby, but ONLY in positions of 3 SCs or less.   France and Turkey in ``So
Good It Hurts", for example.
<i>((Gotcha.))</i>

<p>
(MAINIACS to BRIT PACK): Hmmm, a surprising lack of
low numbers out here.  Hope we don't all get left
behind.

<p>
(EVANGELIST-JIM-BOB):  From the game name, it looks like I should have
switched my rider names between this game and the <i>Tinamou </i> game!

<p>
(ANDY-WORLD):  Anybody besides me making a special effort to view to Total
Lunar Eclipse on 20 January?
<i>((It was very, very cloudy here, nothing to see, a special effort would

<p>
(FIELD-SCHULTZ):  How can your riders enter?  They're still finishing the
first race!

<p>
(TFWS -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font

a brave new ending.

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Her hair is the color of the blood dried on the
upholstery. She says she doesn't mind. Clever Sintians forge a web of power in
the balkanized states from their base on Lemmy's island. A failed deal with the
American devil looses their uncouth fury and thins the ranks. the cell splinters,
but forays back to the continent suggest conquest is still possible, if not
imminent. History has a stutter again. The
Mekons are here for a little more reconnaissance.''
A little Mekons' mindrot.... relates to the Kennedy murders and the last press
item.... really, it does!!

<p>
(EGYPT-UKRAINE): Kaz to Iran is to help my Arabian Sea fleet in case the 
Romulans attack.

<p>
(UKRAINIAN BREADBASKET - GERMANY FISHING FLEET): Don't 
mind our maneuvers, just plowing some more fields.  Nothing
for plowing a field like a platoon of tanks!

<p>
(EGYPT to THE WORLD): I wanted to end all speculation as to the ``real'' mission
of my fleet in the Arabian Sea.
Newly discovered ``Turkish intelligence reports'' indicate possible enemy
fleet movements in the Romulan Neutral Zone, 100 miles south of Saudi
Arabia.
Our mission is to investigate, defend the integrity of our border, and
to report any sightings of either Klingon, Romulan, or Tholian ships and 
their purpose to the Federation Council and Admiral Kirk.
<i>((Are you sure you shouldn't join the new Star Trek game??))</i>

(SPAIN to BRITAIN): How is your security now?? I think it's perfect if you

<p>
(BRITAIN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font

Well, I'm sure you see your best opportunities without my input.

<p>
(FLOATING BRAIN-FLYING BRAIN): You may be the best, but you're not
all-powerful, especially when the whole world is against you.

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): You cool?
<i>((Isn't it cold enough for you outside???))</i>

<p>
(JEFF-HARRY): On Richard Nixon; As usual, a political discussion has
been brought to the press not by me.
I believe that Richard Nixon was basically an honorable man and his
behavior after his presidency proved at least that he was capable
of being a statesman.
I feel that the corrupt Richard Nixon was a direct result of the 1960 
election won by Nixon.
In Illinois and Texas there was voter fraud, the election was stolen.
When presented with the evidence, Nixon refused to fight it because he
knew that a scandal of that magnitude would be bad for the country.
His quote was ``Kennedy stole the election fair and square.''
Kennedy, of course, had nothing to do with the fraud.
It was the Mafia political machine doing what it always does.
I honestly believe that the Mafia got Kennedy elected and they were
probably stunned when Kennedy unleashed his brother Bobby in their 
war against organized crime.
I'm guessing they murdered both Kennedys for this and this alone.

<p>
I believe that Richard Nixon created the corrupt Committee to Re-Elect
the President (CREEP) as a direct result of the 1960 election.
When Nixon passed away, his former White House lawyer, Howard Kulzon
(I'm not sure that's the right name) was quoted as saying,
``we had it stolen from us and the American people in '60, by '68 we
were committed to do what ever it took to survive politically.''
It is no surprise to me that the liberal TV media controlled basically
by Democrats 99-1 portray Nixon as a megalomaniac and a warmonger.
They harp on Watergate but never even mention or even bother to
investigate the 1960 election.
Richard Nixon did not start the Vietnam war, Johnson did.
<i>((Actually, technically, Eisenhower and Nixon really took the
first steps.... you can't blame one person or administration, I 
don't believe....))</i>
Nixon tried to win it but couldn't because the Democrats in Congress
fought any attempt by the Administration to attain military victory.
Richard Nixon also helped save our only real ally in the Middle East,
Israel, during its war with Egypt.
Nixon was unable to win the Vietnam War, but he at least got our people
out of there.
Richard Nixon was also the last US President to preside over a Congress
that administrated a balanced budget. 
That Congress took away the President's constitutional power of impoundment
(pocket veto) laying the foundation of today's 1 trillion dollar debt,
admittedly caused by both parties.
I'm not saying Nixon was a prince, but he was a better president than
either Johnson or Carter.
I understand that Watergate has to be a major part of his legacy, but I'm 
guessing history will remember him most as a great Cold Warrior.

<p>
As a side note on the Kennedy murders, I highly recommend that everyone 
rent or buy a mini-series called ``The Captain and the Kings''.
I believe this is a subtle portrayal of the rise to power of Joe
Kennedy, the rise to political power of his sons to presidential
candidates, and the motivational dynamics behind their murders.

(F-J): When will friendly fleets be in HK? 
I am unable to hold on much longer.

(SCENE): West Indian Ocean.  A young Peter O'Toole rides aboard the
Dutch Battleship Lindhooven.  Tucked under his arm - a newspaper,
headlined ``Russia and Holland bickering over Arabia."
O'Toole mutters to himself ``it seems they need some help from the
Irish".  

<p>
To the crew: ``We set sail at once, for Arabia, and glory!"

<p>
Sarcastic Charlie, the first mate, asks "gee, boss, if Arabia's not
even a supply center, what's the big deal?"  

<p>
O'Toole's reply: oh, I think we'll see a nice SC planted right in the
sand, eh?  

<p>
The crew laughs heartily, and poor Charlie doesn't get the joke.
(It's a pretty lame joke, so we can forgive poor Charlie.)
(fade out to ``Lawrence of Arabia" music)
