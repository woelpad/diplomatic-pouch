Jim,
 
Here are my first orders and a wee bit of press:
 
F Kiel to Holland
A Berlin to Kiel
A Munich to Burgundy 
 
Berlin (Die Zietlung):  Kaiser Marcus I announced the commencement of defensive maneuvers in the West.  "After the violent incursions from the vintners in Burgundy, we have shifted a few light units of brewmeisters into the region to replant vines with hops.  Truly this Oktoberfest will be one to remember in the glorious annals of Germany."
 
Ministers were dispatched to all powers fully noting that the moves were defensive only and evidence no intent to have any hostile action to any other power in Europe.  "We have the fondest feelings to all our friends in Europe, as long as Burgundy and the Low Countries are pacified under a multilateral Prussian peacekeeping force, central Europe shall rest at ease."  
 
In other news, fishermen in the Baltic not that the seas are calm and that the fish are teeming.  "We hope there will be no concussions to spook the fish this year," stated Georg Bassmaster a local fisherman.  German military officials immediately responded promising no action in the north to disrupt any fishing fleets from any nation, "Sweden can rest easy under Russian protection."
