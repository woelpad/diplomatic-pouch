<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sorry about the lateness of this issue.  As I think I mentioned, I was moving my office
at work, and rather than be completely unproductive I tried to "do it all" and what
fell apart was the szine.
I am still not completely moved since my new office is stacked with boxes which I can't
see having time to unpack for another couple of weeks, but hey, I can't keep you all 
waiting any longer.
I think we're all set with things in here, with a couple of exceptions, 
I advanced one game ahead past a "do nothing" deadline, but I still don't
have everyone's card setups for Breaking Away and I think the 23 tunes is
still a bit of a mess.
But hey, that one's just for fun.
I think at least for 23 tunes I don't have anyone with tunes they've submitted
that I don't have.
Last issue I forgot to include Doug Kent's tunes.
Despite that, we have another new subszine, Doug is spreading his wings a bit
with a subszine here.
I think, if the demand/need is out there, he would prefer to have his own 
separate szine.
So if you're interested in that, tell him.
I'm willing to be completely flexible here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARGARET GEMIGNANI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, now, why Margaret?  Margaret, of course, is one of the most famous personalities in 
Dipdom, Science Fiction, Star Trek, Comic, etc. fandom.  
She was a nurse in the DC area, I believe, and then retired to Florida some years ago.
Many people had an address for her in Fort Lauderdale (including me), but that address
went missing around 1994.
If you do Google searching, as I have done off and on, there is a Margaret Gemignani
that contributes to the Baltimore and Ohio Historical Railroad Association, along with 
a husband, Gino (anyone know if that matches.... the B&amp;O matches where she used to live...
but don't tell me, use it as info to go looking yourself!!!)
Margaret has a couple of mentions in the Diplomacy AtoZ and I first encountered her
in the old Bernie Oaklyn <i>Le Front</i> szine.
I think it would be fun to find her.
You have until issue 310 and then we move on to someone else.
Bill Quinn is found!!!
Plus we re-find Dan Stafford.  
More on the former BNC, Bill Quinn, below.
Doug Kent wins $25 for the find.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jeff, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jeff Key or Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Bill Quinn (Feb 25, 2007 9:18 AM)</b>   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doug Kent found me. I didn't know I had been misplaced. Until then I had
not thought much about the hobby. Passages in life have drawn me away.  I gave
myself a tour of what I could find on the net about the hobby. Kathy Byrne
Caruso's passing caused me sorrow. We corresponded and spoke often during
our tenures as BNC and when I published "Everything...". Even when she broke
up our happy alliance in the only game we started together we laughed about
it. At least I could say, "I've been Byrned"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not surprised to find the postal segment in steep decline and most
likely headed to extinction. The e-mail generation has far more games to
play in a more instantaneous mode. I traded notes with Tom Howell to learn
that few numbers had been issued and the office of BNC had run into some
neglect since 1997.  He reports that the e-mail Diplomacy gaming is quite
active but no numbers are issued and chaos reigns.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just to see what relics it contained I brought my 1976 Bookcase Edition
of Diplomacy down from it's quiet corner of a little used book shelf. Inside
were Issue #121 and 122 of <i>Claw and Fang</i>. It was fun to read the original
spoofs of Robert Frost and John LeCarre from a supposed "Famous Writers
Game". There was a copy of Doug Beyerlein's "Adjudicating Postal Diplomacy
Games". Was he meticulous! A game start announcement on the back of a
conference map turned up. Hope it got a number. Last I found a Diplomacy
tournament procedures pamphlet for Origins XV. I attended it mainly to meet
the influential members of the hobby at the time. The inspiration lasted for
years. A few other items were there. Diplomacy Digest #99 was residing
there. The issue that touched on the GREAT FEUD and several articles about
Turkish strategy and the results of the Runestone Poll. In all a nice stroll
through some memories.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To avoid boring readers I'll stop now. If anyone would like to send me a
note (either postal or e-mail) please do.  Good gaming to all.

<b>WORLDMASTERS04 SECTION</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer, Doug Moore,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.
Actually, the Semifinal games began in October.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen anything on progress in these games,
and that's why.
More on that next issue!!!
Thomas Franke and David Partridge are in a game together that seems
on first glance to be the weakest in the rest of the players.
So my first thought is that one of those two will have a slot in
the finals.
I am getting raked over the coals for it, but I just ended a game
in a three way draw between me, Thomas, and Ray Setzer that I might
have had a chance in ekeing out a win mostly because Thomas asked
for it to end so he could focus on this semi-final.
Sorry, David, but I had to do it.....
Of course, after saying that, David Partridge is in England getting beaten
on by Guy Thomas in France, who is allied with Thomas Franke in Italy.
But Italy has a Juggernaut bearing down on him from Mike Tombu and
Julio Cardoza.
And Toby Harris just got crunched in his game where he is Turkey, but
I don't count him out yet, he has more lives than a cat!!
But never mind, I don't know how ANY of this will turn out!!!
Doug Moore is doing pretty well as Russia in his game so far, but
Russia can always be crunched after doing well early.
Buffalo is doing pretty well in his game as France taking down Germany
and now attacking Adam Silverman's England, I think, that part is still
developing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where some of this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
I had to go the main Worldmasters site at www.worldmasters.net/wm04/ to
find some of these results.
The new Tournament rankings for FTF also are out there that supercede the
ones that were on 18centres.
Go check out:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://eurodip.nuxit.net/php/ranking/index.php?lang=Ang

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It ranks 4792 FTF players and is the most complete known compilation of FTF play
ever in the hobby.
You really want to check it out.
Poor Eve Smith ends up 4791st, having been in 33 tournaments in the last ten years,
an achievement in itself!
And of course Don Del Grande is down near the bottom at 4787th, off of 13 tournaments,
two of them in Australia.
For having the Don Challenge Cup named after him, he didn't do THAT badly in his
tournaments Down Under, better than I'd been led to believe at 54/78 and 34/57
And Frank Johansen is a well deserved #1.
And I'm amazingly in the top quarter with a ranking of 1154, accurately reflecting
the nine tournaments that I know I've been to (i.e. I don't see any missing).
Yann Clouet (if I counted right) has been to 95 tournaments, I'd be surprised if
someone surpasses him in number, and he ranks 11th.
Guaranteed to be a fun browse....

So, I'm officially looking for a lead editor again.
As we have had for the last five years or so, the Pouch is back up and
running again, and Diplomacy World is dead in the water, it seems that is
the way it is.
One runs, and the other one stops.
This occurs even though there really is no direct connection.

<br /><br /><i>((I've got two con reports this issue, one from Mike Barno, the
other from me.
First Mike for Bruce Linsey's New Year's KniziaKon.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno (Wed, 10 Jan 2007 23:21:53 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Invitational-only (so I couldn't bring my workplace or weekend people), 
KniziaKon hosted a bunch of folks for 192 plays of 108 different games, 
including 44 different Reiner Knizia games.  (Knizia is the designer of 
TAJ MAHAL, INGENIOUS, TIGRIS &amp; EUPHRATES, LOST CITIES, MEDICI, MODERN 
ART, RA, THROUGH THE DESERT, TRAUMFABRIK, and other notable games.  This 
con emphasized casual play of his games, but was otherwise for casual 
play of darn near any strategy games including one or two collectible 
card games.) 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots of friends including a few from the 1980s.  First time I'd seen 
Steve Hutton in fifteen years.  I was there Friday noonish until Monday 
noonish and played two dozen games without trying hard.  For example of 
not gaming every waking moment, I took two decent-length hikes and 
several short ones.  On one of the hikes at the Martin Van Buren Trails, 
I saw a nesting pair of hawks drive off a larger group of other birds... 
peregrine falcons, possibly... who were trying to chase them out or kill 
their eggs.  Noisy, impressive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the same house the previous New Year, I won a game (a short 
pirate-themed card game) at 11:59 pm on 31-Dec, the last finish of the 
old year.  This time, I won a game of ZUM KUCKUCK!, a short 
cockatoo-themed card game, at 12:01 am on 1-Jan, the first finish of the 
new year.  Woo hoo!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had only two repeats, so there were 22 different titles, including 8 
designed by Reiner Knizia:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Grand National Derby [Piotnik Games], 4 players, learned, Knizia : 
steeplechase horse racing, bet on horses and play cards, worst horse at 
each fence is eliminated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Money! [Gold Sieber Games], 5 players, Knizia : set collecting among 
several types of currencies, with an interesting mechanic: bid some of 
your cards, players choose in high-to-low-bid order to swap the bid 
cards for one of two groups on the table or for another player's bid cards.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Medici [Amigo Spiele], 5 players, Knizia : classic abstract Eurogame, 
auction of cards of five colors, bonuses for winning each color and for 
best total card value.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Crokinole, 4 players in 2 teams, won : disk-flicking game on a wood 
board with bumpers, trying to get your disks into a hole in the middle, 
simple rules give enough strategy to make it more than flick-skill exercise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Gheos [Z-Man Games], 4 players, learned : a build/merge/split game 
somewhat like Java or Taluva, with a military element.  Less fiddly and 
more actiony than most similar games like those named or LASS DIE KIRCHE 
INS DORF.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Settlers of Catan, on 3-D set with miniatures sculpted by Klaus 
Teuber, 4 players, won : plain vanilla Settlers except the big fancy 
board and pieces.  Pretty, but I'm told that kind of resin shatters if 
you drop it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Yspahan [Y'stari Games], 4 players : roll a bunch of dice, players 
choose them for resources or buildings or improvements or caravans with 
a vague theme and little interaction.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- City and Guilds [JKLM Games], 3 players, learned, won : tile placement 
with a medieval city-building theme, seemed more interesting than 
Carcassonne for our tastes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Ticket to Ride: USA 1910, Mega Game [Days of Wonder], 3 players : All 
the old and new ticket cards, more tickets when you draw, both bonuses 
(longest road and most fulfilled tickets).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Ta Yu [Rio Grande Games], 2 players, taught : Just pipe-connecting 
tile-laying like dominoes, but so much strategic richness in such a 
simple set of rules.  My favorite game to teach to non-gamers.
<i>((I've wanted to get and learn this one, you've nudged me to do it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Stephenson's Rocket [Rio Grande Games], 4 players, Knizia : railroad 
building in Britain, merging like Acquire, but very much a Knizia game 
in having multiple ways to earn points.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Taj Mahal [Rio Grande Games], 5 players, Knizia : ingenious 
card-driven six simultaneous auctions, multiple ways to score, theme is 
political jockeying in India.
<i>((I agree, this is a really cool game.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Ta Yu again, 2 players : one of just two games that I repeated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Too Many Cooks [R&amp;R Games], 4 players, learned, Knizia : a 
trick-taking card game where players are trying to make the best soup of 
various types.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Alhambra [Queen Games] with 3 expansions from expansion box 3, 5 
players, learned expansions : we tried the City Walls, Thieves, and 
Change variants.  City Walls adds tiles letting you add extra walls to 
your current tiles on specific tile sides.  Thieves lets you steal a 
particular color of the face-up money cards twice a game.  Change gives 
you a random color's $1 coin for every $2 overpayment, helping you make 
exact change later.  All seem to be interesting additions to the basic 
game.  I liked these better than the four in The Vizier's Favor (box 1): 
moneychangers, huts, play out of turn, bonus cards for particular buildings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Can't Stop [Parker Brothers], 3 players : outdoor on a picnic table on 
New Year's Eve!  dice-rolling push-your-luck silliness.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Einfach Genial [Kosmos], 4 players, taught, Knizia : You guys know 
this as Ingenious.  Tiles covering two hexes, each hex has one of six 
colors, play one tile from a Scrabble-rack of six, and score points for 
hexes of the same color in straight lines all directions away from the 
new tile's two hexes.  Your worst color (not your best color or total 
score) determines whether you win the game.  A big score for you may 
risk a bigger score for the next player, but you might be able to keep 
an opponent from scoring in his worst color.  Plenty of strategy in a 
fairly simple game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Underground [JKLM Games / Rio Grande Games], 4 players, learned : On a 
map of the London Underground system, players build networks of subway 
connections, trying to help a passenger (everybody shares one big white 
passenger) move to one express and one regular station out of four 
random station cards.  The passenger moves under simple rules: walks 
fewest blocks, then (if tied) changes between different networks fewest 
times, then (if still tied) the active player chooses.  You're mainly 
using your current turn's builds to get the passenger to ride your lines 
to certain destinations rather than riding opponents' lines, perhaps to 
other destinations.
<i>((I'd like to get this one, it sounds like fun.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Scrabble [Selchow &amp; Righter], 2 players.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Crokinole again, 2 teams of 2, the only game I repeated except Ta Yu.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Zum Kuckuck [FX Schmid], 4 players, learned, won : simple but fun 
game, auctioning numbered Cluck cards where high bid gets the 
lower/better card and second-high bid gets the higher/worse card, lower 
bidders get nothing new, and whoever has the highest card (old or new) 
showing after each auction gets one of their cute yellow cockatoos SHOT 
DEAD!  Since the hands with many high/low bidding cards are more 
powerful, they get fewer cockatoos to start; and after each hand, you 
pass the bidding cards clockwise and play again, repeating until all 
players have played each set of cards.  That takes out the "luck of the 
draw".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Ra [alea], 4 players, Knizia : One of the classic Eurogames, it uses a 
nice bidding mechanism (winning bid stays in the pot for the next 
winning bidder to use later) in auctions for goodies of various 
categories with various kinds of category scoring.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Industrial Waste [Rio Grande Games], 3 players, won : managing a 
business to produce orders and earn money without having too much 
pollution build up.  I won by refusing to sell raw materials on a couple 
of occasions when the best player needed them, forcing him to discard a 
couple of orders.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Tumblin' Dice [I forget the manufacturer], 4 players : flicking or 
rolling dice onto a terraced board, this is part shuffleboard, part 
Crokinole.  A "1" on the 1x level might get knocked and become a "5" on 
the 3x level (worth fifteen points instead of one), but might later get 
knocked off the end and prove to be worth zero when scored.  Fun.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In all those games, I won a bit less than my share, but came in second 
(of 3-5 players) more than my share.  I learned a bunch of games 
including at least two or three that I'll likely purchase.  Gheos is a 
nifty and competitive game with nice components at a low price.  Zum 
Kuckuck is a pretty neat game with the luck virtually removed but with 
every game different.  Underground is different enough from the other 
connection games, with a sort of puzzle element, to be interesting, and 
it's not too pricey.  I might also get Grand National Derby because of 
its combative element (just before the fence is scored, put a zero card 
on the horse somebody has bet twice on, and the horse gets SHOT DEAD!, 
well, no, it doesn't say that, just says the horse gets eliminated from 
the rest of the race).  I could imagine buying Money! for its auction 
mechanic.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And I had a lot of fun without getting busted or getting killed by a 
drunk driver or other less fun ways to ring out an old year and ring in 
a new year.

We're running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!

<br /><br />
<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
late.
Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number, scores are in parentheses) 
is, in alphabetical order, 
Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper (1), Dick Martin, Richard Smith (3), Joakim Spangberg, and Brad Wilson (4).
The linking theme thing didn't seem to go over too well.
No one really figured out the true linking theme.  
Rick Desper was using Underground tube stops and songs with that as the title,
they were things like that.  
I'll let you guys talk a bit to each other on that with your guesses.
I have added some kind of comment on each tune.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: two more tunes (seven if you're joining up new, four if you NTRed (NO TUNES
RECEIVED!!) and want to get back in), your guesses as to who
submitted which lists, and guesses about people's themes if any.
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.
This part is a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.

Game: Diplomacy

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Teaching Session: Friday night, 8 PM to 11PM, Regular Diplomacy and/or
Escalation Diplomacy depending on numbers.  Escalation Diplomacy II
can be found at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We will use the "five minute teaching guide" that I'll have to hand out as well:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This part did not go too wonderfully.  
I went and set up, I talked to five or six people, but didn't manage to get an Escalation game
started.
There were mostly Miniatures and Magic types around.  
A few knew what Diplomacy was, but they were busy with their games.
We ended up playing two games on Saturday, same players in each game, had a fun time and
decided not to come back on Sunday.
That worked, I probably will do it again.

(STAR TREK PRESS [whether you like it or not!] SISKO'S LOG):
Life is good!
With help from QII we have achieved a great victory against
the Gorn invasion.
We successfully liberated Bajor from its Gorn occupiers and have 
established Deep Space One on the other side of the Federation.
We also obliterated a front line Gorn troop transport and are now
negotiating with QII as to the coordination and disposition of
our invasion of the Gorn home worlds.
We did not start this war, but we intend to finish it!
I am also telling my dad to come up with a good recipe for lizard meat....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS 2, A CONVERSATION BETWEEN PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES (P) AND
GENE RODDENBERRY (G)):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: Gene, we have to tell you honestly, we've been getting some complaints
about Star Trek.
The person who complained didn't have the balls to say who he was
but that might be because he says he has 5XL balls and they are 
on fire, maybe as a result of Star Trek itself.
We have no proof who he is, but we think it's the Intelligent Tribbles.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
G: ... but the Tribbles don't have any balls, in fact they are just
one big large ball.
He must have been speaking metaphorically.
How exactly it is that a character I created can complain about the show.
Doesn't he realize that if the show ends, so does he?
By the way, I think I know why his balls are on fire!
He just dropped his pants in the face of the Dominion invasion of the Tribble system.
The Dominion has already taken one of the three Tribble home worlds.
The Gem Hadar warriors were smokin' cigarettes after that one.
Maybe that's where the fire started?!?!
By the way, I have an idea for a Star Trek "Christmas Carol".
We could have the evil Captain Kirk play Scrooge, Commander Riker
could play Bob Cratchit, Commander Data could play Tiny Tim
and Worf could play the Ghost of Christmas Past.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: There's just one problem, Gene!
No one on any of these shows are Christians.
How can you ever think about doing a Christmas show?
Besides, if we did a "Star Trek Christmas Carol", you should
play the Ghost of Christmas Past, not Worf!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
G: Why?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: Because you are already dead!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
G: Good point!  A belated Merry Christmas everyone, and a Happy New Year!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: You too, Gene!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-STAR TREK POSTER): You do realize that you are giving out tactical 
data when you send out the Star Trek Press right?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BASE to BLACK FIRE): That's B-L-A-C-K Fire, not Backfire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BLACK FIRE): Black indeed, and every film noir I've ever seen starts 
out the way this next one does, just do a liberal substitution in for
the Rap.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS):  "Imido clop non, lipid mono con, Monic idol plo..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That was about all the shit I could take before I got up and shut the window.  
I hate that fucking rap music.  
My head was pounding, my tongue was sand paper dry and felt like it was 
two sizes too big, or my mouth two sizes too small. 
Mental laugh that, me and my big mouth were pretty much mated for laugh.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I shoved a couple of dirty fingers into the venetian blinds to spread them apart, 
trying to judge from the glare through the smudged windows what time of day it was.  
The sun sets hard over the Hobby, days are it’s days, 
and suddenly it’s darkest night... there’s a cliché there somewhere.  
Between the sun doing braindamage glare on the photonic rods 
of my eyes and one squinted glance back at my desk where the 
bottle of Cheater’s sat dry I knew it was time to get up.  
Crack o’ noon, up and at ‘em… well up anyway.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I put two thumbs into my eye sockets to jump-start the whole 
consciousness routine, rubbed them counter clockwise and 
thought about throwing cold water in my face.  
Thought about it, but the plumbing had been out for a week... or more.  
Consciousness is probably over-rated, plumbing is not. 
About the only water I got now was in my whiskey... or not.  
I’m a pretty neat fellow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thinking that; I looked again at the bottle of Cheaters.  
It looked languid, pale and empty.  Key word being empty.  
Empty.  It had been vibrant when full, teeming with 
possibilities and potential; a lot could happen with 
a full bottle of whiskey. 
Now empty it seemed somehow devoid of its purpose in life. 
We were a match.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But hey; it was still worth a nickel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I flipped the empty into the air, caught it by the neck 
and gently stacked it with the others.  
Had about a buck and a half, almost time to trade them in.  
There was more potential out there, a lot could happen 
with a full bottle of whiskey.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But now to the day’s agenda.  It was Tuesday... or not, 
which meant it was Simone’s day off.  Or she was shopping, 
or maybe getting her nails done... anyway, she wasn’t 
at her desk in the outer office, which meant it was Tuesday... 
or not.  I walked out to her desk and looked at the appointments book.  
No appointments, go figure.  
Well, that left the day pretty wide open.  
I could go downstairs to Macgillicutty’s and pick up another bottle 
of Cheaters, one of the few advantages to having your office above a bar.  
As Simone would say "youse have to avail yerself of the accoutrements", 
she was always a little hoitty-toitty, but she had some great pegs and 
she actually could type... or not.  
I don’t think I’d ever actually needed anything typed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I stepped back into my office to get my stuff.  
It’s my mantra... my gun, my cigs, my hat... 
not necessarily in that order.  
I’ve got a great hat, a beat up slouch fedora that has been 
more faithful to me than a couple of wives I could name.  
A hat is what it is; it keeps your head warm and the sun 
out of your eyes, it doesn’t lie, it doesn’t spend the 
Christmas money or sleep with your pal Fred, it doesn’t ...hey, it’s a hat.  
It is what it is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now my gun, it’s a good gun.  I don’t need the big bang, 
don’t need the showy piece.  I’ve got a good solid revolver that 
I know I can hock for 30 bucks when the chips are down, 
or the well is dry... if you know what I mean.  
That gun has bought me more than a few bottles of Cheaters in its time.  
A lot of guys like the big firepower, the automatics, 
me hey I know this is fiction, hell it’s Hobby press.  
I’ve gotten eight, ten shots out of this puppy in a gun fight.  
The editors don’t count the bullets, and the readers don’t care.  
I killed a guy once with an empty gun... it didn’t take, 
but it got me to the next page.  
A lot of times that’s what it’s all its about... getting to the next page.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cigs were some brand I hadn’t heard of before... Red Kings. 
They were a "loner pack", which means I took em off some 
patsy that owed me money or information or both, and couldn’t pay... or did.  
Anyway, I didn’t buy them.  They were loners the way your 
last dollar or your sister’s phone number was, it wasn’t coming back. 
I didn’t much care what cigarettes I smoked, I was partial to cigars.  
Afterall, a cigarette is just a cigarette, a good cigar is a smoke.  
Good line, that should be in a movie or something.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The pack lay partially crumpled on my desk, only a couple of fags left.  
Would have to pick up more with the Cheaters.  
I don’t think I enjoyed em so much, but I was using them to cut down 
on the cigars, and the drinking... and the women.  Seemed to be working.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Kings?  I looked up... weird, sounded like someone said Red Kings?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Kings, Green Kings... menthol?  No way would I smoke menthol.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Damn, I need a drink.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-MALICE): I can think of someone else that is trying to rival Jim-Bob 
with the press.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MALICE IN CENTERLAND - PART THREE: DOWN THE NORTH ATLANTIC DOT):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Malice decided that reading TAP was a tedious experience indeed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Tediouser and tediouser," he muttered, turning yet another page.  
"What good is a szine without pictures or poems or press or humor or intelligent prose?"  
He was thinking about returning home with the demon when he realized he was alone, 
the demon nowhere in sight.  
Don was gone, as were the woods, save for the tree under which he sat.  
He found this unusual and, slowly realizing something was amiss, rose to his feet.  
As he stood, a bizarre and misshapen mechanical creation ran up, 
looking for all the world like a mutant butler.  
The Mutant Butler which had become a proper noun since the preceding sentence) ran close by, 
LED eyes blinking brightly and entirely too redly.  
It whirred and rattled as it came to a stop on the far side of the tree.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm late, so incredibly late.  Oh, Hell!  Oh, Hell!  The deadline's on me!  
It's come!  It's come!  I'll be too late!  Too, too late!  Much, much too late!"  
There was nothing so incredibly odd about this, thought Malice 
(though he'd later believe himself to have been hitting a crack pipe 
to think such a thing), but when the android Mutant Butler pulled a 
folded-over calendar from its red waistcoat and peered at it, 
then hurried off at a whirring, rattling run, Malice's interest was piqued;  
he'd never seen a mechanical Mutant Butler wearing a 
red waistcoat with a pocket before, or one owning a calendar to take out of it, 
and so without much thought he ran after the noisy android, 
for the Mutant Butler was an android indeed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The Mutant Butler did not run fast, but it did run far.  
Very far.  Malice followed, increasingly and continually perplexed 
as the green ground beneath his running feet turned blue, 
and as the blue turned to water, and as the water turned to waves, 
and as the waves eventually turned frigidly cold.  
He indeed also found it curious that both he and the 
Mutant Butler could even run on water.  
It seemed absurd, of course, that he could run on watery waves - for 
he had never done so before - but beyond this logical impossibility 
his brain did not go, and neither should yours.  
They ran this way across the waves for a very long time, 
always with the Mutant Butler ahead and so, when the android abruptly 
disappeared right in front of him into a gaping hole in the gelid water, 
Alex was startled.  He struggled to a stop, and found himself standing 
alone at the very edge of a large round hole, floating in the middle 
of the watery expanse of what (I will share with you Gentle Reader, 
though our Alex has not a clue) is the North Atlantic Ocean.  
Some aspect of the hole's composition looked strange to him and he 
noted that it appeared to float on top of the waves rather than extend into them; 
it seemed rather like a large, solid, black dot.  
Alex tossed his copy of TAP toward the hole and it vanished instantly into 
darkness, as if it had fallen not into the hole, but rather through it.  
Alex found the hole's qualities - both floating on top of the water 
yet extending into it as well - confusing and, well, paradoxical.  
Perplexed or not, though, he had lost all feeling below his knees 
in the freezing water.  
Hypothermia was soon to follow and he somehow dimly realized, 
his nearly frozen heels and soles screaming for respite, 
that he must take some action to avoid an unspeakable 
(and narrative-ending) fate.  
Dazed and confused, he decided to do as he always had done 
in the past when faced with paradoxical and contradictory information; 
he shut off his brain.  
Not surprisingly, this clarified his thinking and he hesitated not a moment 
longer before jumping into the North Atlantic Dot, 
not considering for an instant how he might ever return.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Everyone got fall orders in, and so here is Fall.  
Winter deadline is quick, so please get your builds and removals to me
quickly.
Anyone may make their Winter orders conditional on the English retreat, 
but I expect France especially will need to do that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I had the year of the game wrong, it IS 1905.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

simultaneous Red Alert and Distress Signal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-ERIC AND PAUL): Looks like that you two will achieve what I have not 
been able to achieve by the map situation....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BREST):  No long to go, Winston.  Owning Portugal prolongs your demise one

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Send in your riders and their starting cards NOW!!!
Your A rider can have three or four cards that need to add up to 30,
your B rider three cards adding up to 25, your C rider three cards
adding up to 20, and your D rider three cards adding up to 16.
You also need to name your team, and can have a team captain if you want.

2) The name of this new game is CAST NO SHADOWS, a great name for a pelaton based
game.
But of course, this is a very excellent Mekons song. 
I don't have all your cards and setups, get them to me now!
