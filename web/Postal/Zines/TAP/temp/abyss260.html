All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
This issue we just have a subsubszine from Michael Lowrey of <i>Houdini Blues</i>
restarting the game that Mark Kinney was GMing I mentioned a few issues back.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>VERY late last second word that Bob Acheson has passed away.
I'll say more about this next issue.
Bob will be missed greatly and sincere condolences to his brother Doug Acheson
and his entire family.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><p><br><p><br>The last two or three issues have been plagued with errors as I sincerely
keep hoping that my schedule becomes a bit more manageable.
I apologize to all of my loyal players and I'm trying to get more organized
real soon.
The World Cup ends this weekend.
My prediction of a nil-nil overtime shootout win for Germany still stands as
a good one.
Go ugly!
More on that in various places below.

<p>
My other big ``time intensive'' news lately was the wedding of my stepson.
He just returned from his honeymoon in Amsterdam and they had a great time.
We also hosted a ``rehearsal dinner'' for everyone attending the wedding,
so the pocketbook has been hit big time.
And Charlotte of course designed the most amazing decoration scheme for
a rehersal dinner ever.
But it all was well worth it.
Charlotte brought along a costume design friend who helped her set everything up
(it took about four or five hours) and invited him to stay for the wedding.
As Charlotte said, ``I have a feeling I might need him on the wedding day too''.
Well, Charlotte had worked with the bride to design and build the wedding dress,
but the bride managed to forget the headpiece back here in Providence (the 
wedding was up in Maine) which we only discovered an hour or so before the
ceremony.
As Charlotte again said, ``I helped, but I was too nervous to do what needed
to be done'' and voila, a new headpiece was designed and built in minutes.
Theatre people learn how to work this sort of magic, but I can't conceive of it.
Since I never saw the original, I didn't even know what happened with this until
the next day!
As a non-family member, he also brilliantly defused a fight between the bride's
mother and the bride (the bride's mother had worn black to a noon garden wedding
and daughter was commenting)
by kicking the bride's mother out of the room as the bride was getting dressed.
Oh, yes, and it poured, so we did the whole thing under a tent (another feature
that Charlotte had insisted on) and the wedding party processed across the lawn
to the tent under five identical green golf umbrellas that Charlotte had 
thoughtfully purchased and brought.
Oh, yes, and the procession music failed as the CD player refused to operate
in the wet.
But none of this matters.  
As I said they had a wonderful honeymoon and that transition is accomplished!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!
When the Postal rate increase goes into effect next issue, I'm probably
going to raise that to two bucks, so get renewals in now!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR BERRY RENKEN</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Many of you remember Berry very well, he really hasn't been lost
for very long, but I think it is time to find him again once and
for all.
His <i>Bluesmobile</i> E-Mail szine was possibly the best pure E-Mail
Diplomacy szine that has ever existed.
Philosophy of life, great games, interesting contests, insightful
letters, it had it all.  Berry disappeared a little over two years
ago now.
He'd always been talking about running away to the South Seas and he
quite possibly has done that.
But find him and win the fifty buck prize!!

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Chris Dickson (Thu, 13 Jun 2002 16:35:46)</b>

<p>
Hi, Jim!

<p>
Please might I suggest Berry Renken as a suitable ``search for" target?
As he was a hobby member until relatively recently, theoretically it
shouldn't be too hard to find him, but he's completely dropped off the
Internet as far as I can tell, which is a shame. You'll probably miss
his 'zine, <i>The Bluesmobile</i>, as much as I do. Not sure whether the same
``write to his last known address" tactic will work, but I've sent
Christmas cards there from time to time and got no reply. Maybe he is
running the transcontinental holiday business of which he dreamed and so
somewhere between the Netherlands and China - in which case $50 will be
scant reward for finding him. Or maybe he's still subscribed to <i>TAP</i> and
just keeping his head down...

<p>
I look forward to seeing you at Manorcon in 2004! Just 26 months to
go...

<p>
<i>((PERFECT choice, Chris.  Actually, I've been sending TAP to Berry for
two years to his last known address.  None have bounced, but neither
have pleas for a ``hey, Berry, how are you?" gotten any answer.))</i>

<p>
Fair enough. This might just be the easiest ``search for" you ever do,
being just a case of ``Berry, write back and I'll send you fifty
bucks..."

<p>
It's nice to think that Berry's travelling somewhere in the world and
that next time he touches base he'll pick up two years' worth of hobby
stuff. No idea whether this has any basis in reality, though.

<p>
<i>((I thought Bluesmobile was the only really successful E-mail/internet
Diplomacy szine to date (with apologies to some great efforts
in psychozine and Tom Tweedy's group).  It really brought people
together and has not been replaced.))</i>

<p>
I don't think the tech is a stumbling block. There's probably a very
high correlation between ``people who would make great postal zine
editors" and ``people who would make great e-zine editors". There are
some decent RR zines out there - but none with the pace, the chat or the
charm which made the Bluesmobile work so well. There's no reason why
there couldn't be, though, it's just a matter of waiting for the right
person with the right motivation to come along.

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:

This should help out my Australian subbers!!

 The play is starting to sharpen up now as France is attacking
Italy and Turkey is attacking Russia.
The history of the WorldMasters tournament is that it is not necessarily
THE best player who wins, but the format and style seem to reward effort.
The player who works the hardest likely will win.  
That's one thing you can say about Egg, he always works HARD on the game,
yet he is presently ``losing''.
I know lots of you can't stand C-Diplo, but that's the way it works....

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all

be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor

<p>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the ``current'' as well as an older
version of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older

<p>
You describe FIFA's worst nightmare (a shootout in the finals), but I think
there's a very good chance you'll be right.  Oliver Kahn has been playing
lights-out in goal lately.  Germany's offense will be hampered a bit by the
absence of Ballack from the finals (SIX assists!), but with Klose and
especially Jancker, I think they'll score.  Brazil has the best attack
Germany will have seen in this tournament; the Germans really have had a
comparatively easy road to the finals, with Paraguay, the US, and Korea in
their way.  Jim, I do think someone will score, despite the natural tendency
to play carefully in a big game like this.

<p>
The irony of this is that, as strong as these two sides look right now, you
never would have picked them to make it this far if you'd wagered several
months ago.  Brazil struggled mightily just to get out of CONMEBOL
qualifying, eventually finishing third, but for a while they were in real
danger of finishing fifth and having to win a play-in round against
Australia.  (Uruguay got that task, and beat the Aussies.)  As for Germany,
they were still smarting from a September 1 massacre at the hands of the
English, 5-1, when the groups were announced.  This team isn't regarded as
being as dominant as past German sides, but they unquestionably belong, as
do the Brazilians.  

<p>
I am a little disappointed that none of the dark-horse entries made it to
the finals; I tire of seeing the same old superpowers play for the Cup
(although Germany and Brazil, with I think seven Cups between them, have
apparently never met in the finals before).  I do agree with something Bruce
Arena said before the quarterfinal match with Germany:  "The gap is
narrowing."  The non-traditional powers are getting better, and while a
finals matchup between, say, China and Ghana won't happen soon, I do think
we will soon see some lesser-known soccer powers seriously contesting for
the Cup.  This year's tournament is a good indicator; I never dreamed that
Korea would make it to the semifinals, or that France, Argentina, and Portugal
would get early tickets home.  (I HAD picked the Turks to go a long way, so
I take some small credit for prescience there.  But my finals picks,
Argentina over Italy, are less laudable.)

It will be nil-nil going to that shootout.
And, there Germany will win.
Also, Brazil and Germany have NEVER met in the World Cup at any level of play.

``Minority Report"  =  =  =  a movie
        
<p>
Stephen Spielberg and Tom Cruise have put together a solid piece of Science 
Fiction.  I like the idea of Malls having a consumer database that allows 
them to target advertising to specific customers as they move through the 
shopping areas.  That looks like a prediction that will come true.  On the 
other hand the future cars that join together into mass transit seemed a bit 
of a stretch.

<p>
``John Anderton" (Tom Cruise) is the top enforcement officer in an 
experimental unit that has stopped homicide as a crime in Washington D.C..  
Through precognitive science the cops are able to arrest the murderer before 
the crime has been committed.  The experiment is such a success the Federal 
Government has decided to take it over and take it national.

<p>
A Federal Agent steps in to observe.  Just as he does a crime is predicted.  
The prediction is that John Anderton is going to murder a man in two days.  
Anderton refuses to accept the prediction.  But in his refusal he casts 
doubt, in his own mind at least, on everything he has done over the past six 
years.

<p>
The movie, with a lot of fascinating detail, shows how these doubts are 
resolved.

<p>
Great movie.

Lots to think and to debate about - you won't soon forget some of the searing

Another thing to think about from the movie, the battle between ``suburban sprawl

Steve doesn't say if he believes the technology of the mass transit system shown
to be unlikely, or whether he believes we are unlikely to slot ourselves into
giant beehives.

<p>
Jim,

<p>
Some general chit-chat.

<p>
A couple of issues back you had a letter from Bob Osuch detailing his
favourite albums which were mostly from the seventies and early eighties.  I
am guessing that Bob, like me, was born in the fifties.  I own quite a few
of the albums he listed as his favourites, namely:

<p>
<p> Spirit's ``12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus".

<p>
I cannot believe this album is currently unavailable on CD.  It's definitely
on my Desert Island Discs list.  A tremendous blend of blues, pop, jazz and
rock from a similar era and a similar locale as Love's ``Forever Changes" but
for my money this album is considerably better, even if it does lack the one
stand-out track which ``Forever Changes" has.  I mentioned Dr. Sardonicus in
a game report in my Fantasy Football zine and of the 13 managers in the game
3 wrote in to agree what a great album it is, so it is definitely not as
obscure as Bob believes.

<p>
<p> The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars

<p>
Practically de rigeur for any male born in the fifties to own this album,
surely?

<p>
<p> Let It Bleed - The Rolling Stones

<p>
My favourite Stones album too, although even after all these years I still
think of the Stones as a singles band.

<p>
<p> Rock &amp; Roll Animal - Lou Reed

<p>
Great band, shame about Lou Reed.   I think the band went on to back Alice
Cooper.  I agree that the guitar work is very strong but disagree about
Reed's vocals.  This is essentially a hard rock album and I don't think that
is Reed's forte; in fact, I wonder what the hell he was doing pandering to
the stadium rock crowd?  Perhaps album sales were down and he was feeling
insecure?  I would not go as far as Bob and claim it is the best live album
ever.  The Who ``Live At Leeds" is the album most often given that accolade
in these parts (and I am not just saying that because the death of John
Entwistle was announced today) whilst if one is purely going on the basis of
dual guitar work then Thin Lizzy's ``Live and Dangerous" matches it in my
view.  My own personal favourite live album is ``Free Live" but there must be
dozens and dozens of great live albums from Muddy Waters all the way up to
the present day.
<i>((Yes, and we are very sorry to see John Entwhistle gone.
He was the gentleman of the band... not that he had much competition.))</i>

<p>
<p> Loaded - The Velvet Underground

<p>
Now this is the Lou Reed I know and love.  A very clever album in which the
band apes a different contemporary musical style on every track.  As Bob
mentioned, take away this album and half the punk bands in the world would
probably never have got started (come to think of it, just take away ``Sweet
Jane" and the same applies).  Hard to believe that the Lou Reed sweetly
singing ``Who Loves the Sun" in a pastiche of the Loving Spoonful/West Coast
hippie-drippy sound is the same guy who wrote and sang ``Heroin".

<p>
<p> Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd

<p>
I probably would have bought this back in the seventies except there was no
need to.  In Britain every person under the age of 30 (except me, obviously)
owned it and it was played constantly on Radio Caroline (a pirate radio
station that broadcast from a ship in the North Sea, outside territorial
waters).  It stayed in the UK charts for something like 134 weeks, a feat
only surpassed at the time by the massively turgid Tubular Bells.  I don't
know if the band Coldplay is making any impression in the US but here in the
UK they are doing quite well with their sub-Dark Side Floyd inspired
wittering. I prefer the real thing myself.  Maybe I will end up owning the
album one day.
<i>((Yeah, I own it, but almost never play it.
I heard ``Tubular Bells" in a store the other day and it is amazing how
poorly it has held up.
I really did like it in its time.))</i>

<p>
<p> Harvest - Neil Young

<p>
The old whiner.  What is it with harmonica sucking singer-songwriters?
Young's voice is easily as idiosyncratic as Dylan's and both artists' early
stuff is very stripped down as if to force you to concentrate on the songs.
Whereas a lot of Dylan's songs get covered and covered well, no one seems to
be able to do a Young song quite as well as Neil Young.  Incidentally, Neil
Young's back catalogue is not exactly understocked but if there are any Neil
Young fans out there desperate for more of that sort of thing then Ian
McNabb, former leading light of the Icicle Works, seems to be gradually
metamorphosising into Young, even to the extent of touring with Crazy Horse
6 or 7 years ago.  McNabb's ``Head Like A Rock" is the most Young-like of his
albums, but that's hardly surprising as Crazy Horse play on it.

<p>
<p> Perhaps of more interest are the albums Bob likes that I don't.

<p>
I am sure there are many fanatical Grateful Dead fans in the UK but as a
national phenomenon they seem to have passed Britain by.  Aside from the
efforts of the aforementioned Radio Caroline (a radio station that had its
heyday in the sixties and which sailed through the seventies as if it were
still the sixties) I don't recall the Dead getting much airplay. I may be
wrong but I get the impression the Dead's appeal went hand in hand with dope
culture and that never took off to any great extent in Britain where ``pub
culture" is more strongly rooted.  I haven't heard much Dead stuff but I
always imagine it to be full of long rambling guitar solos which is
something I can do without.
<i>((I remember when I was a college station radio DJ in the seventies
the staff pretty much split evenly into those who NEVER played the Dead
(I was in that camp) and those who ALWAYS played the Dead.
Today I am less extreme on this point, but it really was a polarizer there
for awhile.))</i>

<p>
King Crimson were a band I lumped into the pomp-rock category, perhaps
unfairly.  I always regarded people who liked Yes, ELP, Gentle Giant, Moody
Blues, Genesis, Greenslade, Soft Machine and Caravan as pretentious ponces
back in my teens cos I was into hard rock.  
<i>((That would be me.
Actually, I found most of what these bands produced to be relatively pedestrian
and moved out another level of pomp to Nektar, Synergy, Klaus Schulze, and
Stomu Yamashta (the record ``Go Live from Paris'' might be a touchstone here, 
featuring Steve Winwood, Michael Shrieve, Klaus Schulze, Al DiMeola,
Brother James, AND Karen Freidman on vocals!).))</i>
To be honest, I have not changed
my opinion of the bands a great deal but I am a lot less inclined to be
snooty about other people's music tastes.  In The Court of the Crimson King
was another Radio Caroline favourite - or at least the title track was.
Despite all the fiddly showing off with time changes and stop-start rhythms
the title track is an impressive piece of music and maybe I should have
given the rest of the album a chance but the presence of flute on just about
any album was off-putting to me in those days!  Again, I would not class
this album as obscure but I am speaking from a British perspective.

<p>
Abbey Road may be Bob's favourite Beatles album but with the exception of
Let It Be and the hideously over-rated Sgt. Pepper I'd grade it as my least
favourite.  Although I haven't listened to it in a long time and have never
owned it I look at the track listing and think ``filler ... filler ... filler
.... B side ... filler".  To be sure the Fab Four's fillers are better than
most band's staple fare, but for me Revolver and Rubber Soul are the two
best Beatles' albums.  It may be an unfashionable view to rate the early
Merseybeat stuff such as ``With the Beatles" as better than Abbey Road but I
personally really enjoy the naivety and energy of the band's early stuff.

<p>
In the same issue (<i>TAP</i> 256) someone was eulogising about Flo &amp; Eddie. I
don't have the Best of Flo &amp; Eddie but I do have the best of the Turtles and
what a stonkingly good album it is too!  I would not, for one moment,
suggest that the Turtles' contribution to popular music in any way
approaches that of Brian Wilson but I do feel that the Beach Boys'
back-catalogue has been recycled so many times that it has lost its
freshness, so when I want to listen to summery vocal harmonies I reach for
the Turtles every time.  Unlike the Beach Boys' high-pitched harmonies I
don't find the Turtles' harmonies as wearing so I never tire of their songs.
Plus I seem to be going through a ``swing" phase (no, I have not forgotten my
promise to review the Louis Jordan 6 CD set) and the Turtles really swing; I
suspect they were jazz musicians at heart. 
<i>((And I won't let you forget.
My favorite Louis Jordan is ``Rockin' and Jivin' 1956/57 Vol. 1'', music
done at Mercury just before the time I was born.
I have a 1986 German reissue version of this on vinyl.))</i>

<p>
I can't comment on Paul Revere and the Raiders as so far as I know they made
zero impact in the UK, which is perhaps not surprising given the origin of
the band's name! Were they anything like the Young Rascals?
<i>((Not really, my brother loved them, so I tried hard to hate them.
I didn't quite succeed, they're OK - more general British Invasion
knockoff.  I can't see how there would be any call for it back in Britain.))</i>

<p>
Ah well, time for me to go home.  Perhaps I just have time to comment anon
on the passing of John Entwistle, a rock solid bassist in the world's second
best Mod band*.  I can't say I am deeply saddened by his death; 57 is not a
bad age and the band's best days were well behind them, but I shall remember
him and the Who with a good deal of fondness.  My brother, who is 5 years
older than me, took me to see the Who when I was 18.  Prior to that any
contact my brother and I had usually entailed me annoying the hell out of
him and him kicking the crap out of me, and that concert is representative
of the start of a much more cordial brotherly relationship which I am happy
to say has lasted ever since, so I would always have a soft spot for the
band even if they had not written some of the best rock music ever written.
What must it have been like to have written something so brilliant and
significant as ``Won't Get Fooled Again?" by your late twenties?  All
downhill from here, chaps! No wonder Townshend always looked so miserable.

<p>
* Not that the Who were really a Mod band, that was just a publicity pose.
Certainly real Mods would never listen to a white rock band - with one
exception, that being the Small Faces - as their standard fare would have
been r&amp;b, bluebeat and ska.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small ``s'' instead of a capital ``S''.
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
I have been getting complaints and suggestions for doing underlines.
Underlines are really hard to do and I've become attached to italics
but I am considering this as carefully as I can.
I tried an experiment but got no comments on it, so I'm
going back to what I did before.
In the experiment, you CAN'T tell on the html web page version
or in the E-Mailed version what supports were cut and moves fail.
I admit it looks a bit better in the printed version, but there you
can see the italics pretty well too, can't you?

John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper is the only one signed up for that.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I really, really screwed up. 
Let me give you all a time line here, not because it serves
any real purpose, but because I feel guilty and so feel
I should serve some penance through some self-flagellation.
Both of the last two issues have been extremely rushed through
some personal and professional issues going on.  Some of
those issues have been outlined here.
Anyway, back in issue #258, I made the big mistake.
You see, the text of the szine stores hundreds and hundreds
of notes to myself all the time.
Then I comment them out so that they aren't printed and you
all can't see them.  
Moreover, rather than having ``E-Mail folders" this actually
is where I store the E-Mails themselves when you all send in
orders!
This is immensely easier for me (just carrying around one giant
file) and then it all is in the right place so I can work 
incrementally on the szine any time I have a chance.
Well, the problem is: what if you forget to comment something out
that isn't supposed to be printed?
I do this about once every four or five years and then it 
``scares me straight''.  
Another problem... my work computer blocks access to all non-work
related web pages, including the Pouch and all of TAP. 
So, when I'm at work (and I'm here far more often than I should be)
I can't go look at back TAP's.
Even when I'm home, I frequently use a computer (especially very 
early in the morning or late at night when Charlotte is sleeping)
whose modem is broken, but it's great for just typing.
One more factor, I always adjudicate the games first and then
work in and organize the press at the end.
The press gets thrown into the middle of the file and then I clean it up.
Well, so what happened?
Working on Issue 258, I forgot to comment out Rick's early submitted 
orders and failed to notice it.
You all can see that they were published.
But NO one directly told me about this.
Fool and Rick had a back and forth discussion that included me before the
deadline for Issue 259 (I don't feel at liberty to disclose the details,
but it left me ``knowing that Fool knew what Rick was doing, that Rick
knew that Fool knew what he was doing, and Rick and Fool not seeming 
overly concerned about it".  I had no idea (and Rick didn't either 
participating in the same discussion) at this point that I had made
a mistake.
After the deadline for Issue 259, I adjudicated the game as usual.
Then I got up at about 4:30AM one day to try to finish plugging in
the press.
I wanted to print the szine that day at work and get to the copier
right after work.
There were statements in there that seemed to indicate that I might
have made the error that I did make.
But I wasn't sure and I had no way to check right then (working on 
the ``modemless computer".
I made a mental note to think about this later, but didn't have a chance
to log on or go to the main computer that has all the files on it
before going off to work.
Then at work, I looked at my E-Mail and went back to the conversation
with Fool and got confused again the other way.
I thought, ``hey, maybe I didn't make a mistake" but Fool somehow
revealed Rick's orders to Austria and generated Austria's press.
But I didn't have time to go back and change the press and from
work I couldn't look at the TAP web page.
Plus, work was really, really busy so I hardly was thinking about 
it all day.
When the end of the day came (and by the way because of time away etc.
if I didn't print the szine RIGHT then, it would have been delayed 
another full week), I just printed it.  BIGGER mistake.
I should have delayed the game then.
Well, we can't go back, but we can take a break so that I can make
this mea culpa to ALL the players, you all can reconsider the game
on the board and what happened; and then Winter will be due in a few
weeks.
And if I am not a TOTAL and complete idiot, all of your advance Winter
orders for next turn above are properly commented out.
To move the game forward a LITTLE bit, we have run the Autumn retreats
this issue.
That leaves Winter builds and removals for next issue.
Again, I'm sorry, I can't think of anything else I can do to make up 
for this.
I hope everyone sticks with the game and plays it out as it lies.
I'm sure I won't make that mistake again now for a few years, so
for the life of this game you're all safe.
ASIDE to AUSTRIA: You didn't technically do anything illegal,
but I would have preferred it if you told me right away what
I had done, but it was your call.
Now, I'm SURE I will get at least as much press abuse as
any other player!!!
I'm just going to let this amazing sequence of press run
uninterrupted by my inanity.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BARON to MARY HART ON THE SIDEWALK OUTSIDE OF
GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER): Yes, Mary, it has been a
very hectic couple of weeks. You spend your whole life
working for something, but when you actually achieve
it, no one is more surprised than yourself. But the
support I've received from people on the street-the
letters, the e-mails, the autograph requests-has been
everything I've dreamed of and even the controversy
can't spoil the dream.

<p>
(BARON to DAN RATHER VIA SATELLITE FEED FROM CANNES,
FRANCE): I'm sorry, Dan, it is very hard to understand
you over the link with that speech impediment of
yours. Oh, that's not you, it's the other guy? Well,
maybe it's the Canadian accent. Even Canadians without
speech impediments are difficult to understand most of
the time. What? That's the third guy? Well, maybe it's
the frequency . . . hey, that's funny? Get it? What's
the frequency, Dan? Get it?

<p>
(BARON to DAVID LETTERMAN IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO
AUDIENCE): The people in the game, Dave, are just
ordinary people-not like that last guest you had on!
The green room was feeling a little small to me by the
time he was called to come on. Anyways, Dan, Tim,
Heather, even Jim-Bob, you wouldn't even look at them
twice-well, maybe Heather, she's quite the
stunner-if you passed them on the street. We're not
playing the game to make ourselves different from
everyone else. We may end up that way, but that's not
what we're in the game for. Maybe you should get your
mom to play!

<p>
(BARON to KATIE COURIC AT 8:34AM OUTSIDE ON THE CORNER
OF 49TH AND ROCKEFELLER CENTER): Katie, I call this
recipe ``Turkey Stuffed with a Russian Dressing-down."
The ingredients are simple, but if you cook it just
right, you'll balloon in size! Now, if you could hand
me that baster . . .

<p>
(BARON to DON IMUS FROM THE COURTESY LIMO PHONE): No,
Don, the traffic is still at a dead stop. No, I've got
plenty of time. No, the ranch sounds great, tell me
more. No, I'm not on my way to Howard Stern's show.

<p>
(BARON to HOWARD STERN SITTING NEXT TO TWIN STRIPPERS
SHAVING EACH OTHER'S UNDERARMS): I'm sorry, Howard,
that's kind of private. I agree it's all perfectly
natural but-no, my wife isn't a prude. No, that is
not admitting that I have done that with my wife-No!
I'm not admitting that I've done it with anyone else.
Yes, they're beautiful girls. Well, I am married, so .
. . You know, somehow I think my wife would find out. 
Maybe we should get back to the topic of-No, they're
very beautiful girls. I just don't need that shaved at
the moment.

<p>
(BARON to A CALLER TO THE LARRY KING SHOW FROM 
FUQUAY-VARINA, NORTH CAROLINA): Well, caller, it is
true that there are some foreigners playing in I Can't
Find My Money, but I am not sure I can attribute my
success to ``good old American know-how." I mean, the
guy I stabbed was American. Right, well yes, he's
playing Turkey, but I'm an American playing Austria.
The game powers don't really-yes, I think that's
where Arnold Schwarnegger is from. It is, Larry?
You're right, then, caller. How can I lose if Arnold
is fighting with me. Well, that's a good point, I
guess, but-Wrestling, no I don't-oh, Arnold should
wrestle? The Rock? Larry, I think I'm losing the
thread of the caller's point here.

<p>
(BARON'S COURT MUSICIANS): 
Once IstanBUL was CONstantinople,
Now it's IstanBUL, not CONstantinople,
Been a long time gone, CONstantinople.
Why did CONstantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks!

<p>
Istanbul

<p>
 Istanbul
     
<p>
 IstanBUL!!

<p>
(BARON to BILL MOYERS AT THE NEW YORK CHESS AND
CHECKERS CLUB IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN): Yes, I agree, I
think the essence of the game is the construction of
the myth, of painstakingly building of a narrative
which allows your subject to envision himself in the
role of primal world-maker while at the same time
providing a framework for oneself to shape the
diplomatic and strategic conduits towards a dnouement
of self-ascendancy.

<p>
(BARON to DAN RATHER VIA SATELLITE FEED FROM PARK CITY,
UTAH): Hey, Dan, remember when you were covering the
Soviet-Afghanistan war and you dressed up like a
mujahedeen? Maybe you should wear some lederhose while
you're interviewing me . . .

<p>
(BARON to HIS PUBLICIST WHILE EATING MUSSELS A LA RUSSE
AT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM): Murray, I don't care what's
on the goddamned itinerary, I don't care whose news
van is parked on the sidewalk, I don't care who's
miked and powdered with their cue cards all in order.
I am finishing these goddamn mussels, I am going to my
goddamn room, and I am sleeping for twenty straight
goddamned hours with the shades drawn and the phone in
the goddamned toilet! Pat O'Brien can kiss my
eight-center ass and you can tell him I said so!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I made a big boo-boo in the Supply Center Chart from last time.
I sent the following note to Jack and Don: ``It was staring me right 
in the face, and I knew SOMETHING was wrong, but Jack's fleet is 
sitting squarely in Denmark.  I kept looking to see if ENGLAND 
had taken it and he hadn't, so I blew it.  Anyway, that means Don 
has ONLY his three home centers and has a removal and Jack has 
EIGHT units and thus builds two.  If possible, I'd still like 
Winter orders for Sat. June 22nd, but if not possible, I'll delay 
the game over the error.''
I did get the request to delay the game over the error, so I'm going
to print the press to allow people to keep the game moving a bit.
I only printed press that didn't reveal Winter orders though.
Apologies!
If I have builds or removals on file for you, they are still on file.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EDINBURGH-MOSCOW/WORLD): A north coast fleet in St.
Pete's is war.  Just so everyone knows in the event I
can do something about it.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-BERLIN): We've never been big on the euro. but
it may need saving.

<p>
(EDINBURGH CASTLE TRYING TO STIR UP THE (SOUTH)EAST): How
do I look so big from there?  Russia has gone from
nothing to eight units, while four Turkish units held
and another supported Russia.  Develop issues with the
tsar anyway.
<i>((You must be mistaken, if you had really ever even
BEEN to Edinburgh castle, you would realize that it offers
no views whatsoever of the Southeast, primarily looking out
to the Northwest.
Where are you REALLY, sirrah!?
I see a CON in place....))</i>

<p>
(CHICAGO CALLING): Cubs lost yet another game I attended.
0-3 on the year.
<i>((But I thought you ENJOYED watching the Cubs lose....
a new job in Chicago yet??  Good luck!!))</i>

<p>
(PRESS FROM GOZ): You never know what you might find on ESPN.com.  
As I'm reading a column called ``Baseball losses that Bring Tears", 
where they've asked for reader's responses, I find this:

<p>
``Why even hold this poll?? Every two weeks you drag out some new way to talk
about the 1986 Series and/or the so-called ``Curse." What's wrong with you
people? You are sadists!
Rick Desper,
Gaithersburg, Md.''

<p>
Of COURSE they have to bring it out every two weeks (at least during the
baseball season).  It's a slow news night for those that don't like soccer.
Good job!  Goz

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): Hee, hee, hee, great!
And you meant a slow news MORNING about the soccer, right?
My predicted team, Germany, will win the Cup, but I don't have to 
watch them since I've seen all the goals they've scored and the ONE
goal they've let up on highlights.... ;-)
Of course, see elsewhere for more, they will not actually score any goals
in the final, so I've seen all of the important goals now...
Of course, I'm not following the World Cup at all.
As Don Williams says, ``but you know that France has been eliminated"
and I say, ``yes, but I don't call that 'following' it".

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Based on the way my bracket looks, 
*I* haven't been following the WC at all
either.  Heck, I did better in that NCAA Basketball pool that Jamie ran.

<p>
(EMMERT to BURGESS):  Be careful what you say about the Dodgers, Jim-Bob.  
Some of your loyal fans also bleed Dodger Blue.  Now, of course, I'm not 
allowed to root for the Giants, even if they're playing Saddam's 
All-Stars.

<p>
(BOOB to JUDAS): I have rooted for the Giants as my FIRST favorite team
since I was 7 years old (think Juan Marichal and Willie Mays), and 
cemented in the early 70's when I used to root for utility players
like Ed Goodson who was one of my favorite players EVER while he played
for the Giants from 1970-1975!  
He actually hit over .300 playing third base for them in 1973!
We traded him to the Braves for the stretch run in '75, which was OK.
Aaaagh, but then Goodson played for the hated Dodgers for the next
two years - even playing in the '77 World Series.
It was almost more than I could stand....

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Dwayne Shreve wasn't happy about the way I described his resignation,
but he did say summer was here to me.  I asked him to give me a statement
for publication and here it is:
``I greatly overestimated my post-retirement enthusiasm for a return to Diplomacy
and the imagined vista of a lot of time to spend as well. One would think that 
by now, I would have outgrown my tendency to hyperactivity, but retirement at 52
freed me up to do a lot of things that I had to put off when I was working. I 
have also taken on new skills and interests, such as web site development, biking
and hiking, so there are more things drawing my attention, in addition to the 
other hobbies I have had all along, such as gardening, fishing, reading and 
well-researched travel.
I believe that I will return to Dip at some point in the future; if I ever wind
up in a nursing home, you can even bank on it. I don't much care for the lying 
that one comes across, but I do enjoy strategies when I have time to plan them. 
As it was, I was not doing a good job as Germany, but I managed to leave the game
while also leaving my allies in a better state than they might have been. 
I wish Buddy and John the best and the other players as well.''
Thanks Dwayne, and best of luck staying OUT of a nursing home.
Clearly retirement and Diplomacy have a relationship in the right circumstances.
Larry Peery has done wonders with Diplomacy on cruise ships (where one essentially
is ``trapped on board'' (to make a bad pun!)).
But I certainly agree with you, do what makes YOU happy now.
As I said, you'll still get the szine until the game ends.
Thanks.  

<p>
2) A GRT draw is proposed.
Please vote with your summer orders.
Failure to vote vetoes the draw.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BUDAPEST):  Who wrote that line ``...to my busy dying day"?  It sounds so 
pertinent here.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) We'll have a slightly altered map next time.

<p>
2) I made a Supply Center mistake last time.  Here's what I 
sent to the players: ``Someday I should look carefully at 
Harold's map and get all of the proper three letter abbreviations 
correct in the SC chart.  But I don't.  Mistakenly, since England 
was sitting in Venezuela (actually vza), I somehow thought that 
meant that he ALSO took Venice (ven).  Venice is actually still 
safely behind Austrian lines in Austrian control.  
So please move ven back to Austria from England.
This means that Austria has FOUR builds in his five open buildable
centers: Bud, Vie, Tri, Nap, and Melbourne.  England only has TWO
builds.  Please ask or note if anything else is wrong.  The deadline
for Autumn Retreats/Winter Builds is still Saturday.  If this error
causes too much confusion, I will entertain a proposal for delay
of Winter, but STILL give me your Autumn Retreats in any case
for Saturday.''
I do have everything, so we go ahead with Autumn retreats and Winter
builds.
Thanks, this can be a difficult game to adjudicate at times.

<p>
3) Note that John Power's home E-Mail address has changed.

<p>
4) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) draw is proposed
along with a concession to Spain.
A few issues ago I said:
``Michael Lowrey tells me that you need only 102 centers or 3/4
approval to get a draw to pass in this, and I believe 50 centers
is required for a win.
Forgive me if this sounds ``weird'' since anyone except Dave
Partridge theoretically could be voted out of a draw.
Clarifications or comments would be welcome.''
They still would be.  
I'll go by this rule unless I hear otherwise.

<p>
(SPAIN - RUSSIA):  Nice convoy.  I had to guess between Tar and Wak, obviously
I guessed wrong!  I'm sure you'll give me another chance though!

<p>
(RUSSIA to ENGLAND AND CHINA):  If you guys want to throw this game to 
Spain, I may as well join in and get this over with.  It is a shame.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
2) This was a fascinating turn!
Wow!!
Some easy centers that can just be walked into, and some
centers that every other unit left on the board can move to.
Lots of units blown away too!
And the German army Bohemia is living the charmed life, in
the middle of all that destruction - but with lots of choices
on how to get out!
By the way, you can't NMR or be replaced in this game, you only
fail to move units and withhold the firing of nukes, not that
Jack could have gotten very far out of the way anyway.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY-WORLD): Well, Paul Rauterberg is now #1, and I suggest that we all nuke 
one of his SCs and potential SCs. I will be nuking Brest. I ask the rest of 
you to coordinate on picking other SCs and areas to nuke to cut him down. 
Thank you for your kind attention. I will also be nuking the GM, thus 
reviving a Grand Old Tradition of NYEED.

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): Thank you, thank you, thank you, I am WELL NUKED!

<p>
(PARIS (if it still exists!)):  We try to be even-handed in our degrees of 
meanness, but L'engleterre may not view us as being very fair.

<p>
(BOOB to FRANCE): Paris is quite well nuked too...

<p>
(JOHN - JACK):  What can I say?  Everyone else 
went after #1.  I didn't want you to be lonely.

<p>
(GERMANY - ALL): OK, my last strategy didn't work so well.  Let's try 
something different.

<p>
(KENDTER to SCHULTZ / KENNY): I flipped a coin to decide who pissed me of
worse.  Kenny lost.
Maybe next round you can be bothered to write.

<p>
(BERLIN - ITALIAN POSTAL SERVICE, DISGRUNTLED DIVISION): Good idea that you 
had.

<p>
(SARA-GM): Are you trying to inform us that seven allegedly experienced players 
cannot keep track of what countries they are playing? We all know what 
Harry's excuse is, but what about the rest? 

<p>
(KENDTER to GM): Gee, think I will even get to move a unit this time?

<p>
(BOOB to LEE): Read 'em and weep...

<p>
(KENDTER to WORLD): Will these moves be bizarre enough to let a unit survive
this time?  :MAD:

<p>
(FRANCE to ITALY): Remember that you are not allowed to be the Pope. The Pope 
requires a full set, a rule dating back to the one and only time they elected 
a female Pope.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
3) I think I know how the points are going to be allocated now (so
do many of you), but even I myself am not entirely sure how I am
going to choose between the likely seventh and eighth place finishers.
It will be very, very close.
This choice also may decide the close battle in the overall standings
between the Flightless Birds and the Brit Pack.
Tune in next time as two more riders likely cross and everyone sets
up for the final push.
Two more turns should do it.
Then we'll be starting a new game, not too early to sign up.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ALICE to BOOB):  Oh?  We have to check in?  Coasting across the line
won't do it?

<p>
(BOOB to ALICE): Actually, you COULD have coasted and finished your guys
(uh, I guess Alice is a girl...) in the same places next turn, but
you didn't.

<p>
(TOM-JIM-BOB):  What makes you think my memory is any better than yours? 
Don't you have a little file folder for next year that you can dump the
things into as they are suggested so they'll all be in one place at the
right time?

<p>
(ALICE to BOOB):  Oh!  Am I a bit whiff?  I allus get that way when I been
sweating!

<p>
(THE QUADRILATERALS): Damn, Tom is good at this, and I'm not!

<p>
(BRIT PACK): As designer of the game I am going to unilaterally extend the course
distance to ...... ooooh .... about 640 squares should do it.

<p>
(BOOB to BRIT PACK): I think you took the right chance.
You just needed Rectangle to play his three to get all of your riders
some big cards.
Then again, even that wouldn't have been enough, would it?

<p>
(HALBERT to BOOB):  I gotta lotta best friends; and Dana and Diamond are
two of 'em!

<p>
(ANONYMOUS STUFF):  Having started the game with such 
high hopes I am now reduced to getting my
jollies by stiffing my opponents.  Last turn I was quite chuffed to have
stranded three of the Flightless Birds on square 81.  (I won't bother
signing this Press as you can probably tell from the strange terminology who
wrote it).

<p>
(TRIUMPH - &gt;  GREENWICH): I was really hoping last time that you would
hang back and let my three slowpokes draft a bit.  :(  

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB): Greenwich would have done better playing his 5,
everything else remaining the same.  It'd have made him a scorer...

<p>
(THE BAD BOYS): This `firmly stuck in the pack' is for the birds. 
How do I get out?

<p>
(ALICE to BRUNEL):  Looks like you're doing just fine.  Leaving three
birds and an abbot featherless reads fine in my tactics book!

<p>
(BRIT PACK to GREENWICH): Ah yes, the old ``NMR" tactic.  Shame you did not
teach it to the Border Riders.

<p>
(THE WHITE MAID to BRIT PACK):  How can you suggest such a thing?  (With
the possible exception of the abbot,) I can assure you that the Border
Riders are as pure as ... well, ... the White Maid!

<p>
(TRIUMPH - &gt;  GM, DESIGNER, OTHER GM): I think I like it better when
cards cannot get higher than 15.  This game has been too fragmented
to be interesting.  When everybody plays the same big card, the
pack sticks together a little better.

<p>
(BOOB to TRIUMPH): And who are YOU, isn't Petey the Penguin the coach
of THIS team?  ;-)
More seriously, I really like the chances you take with the really
high card possibilities, so the next Breaking Away here will use
the same rules, but I won't stop anyone else from doing differently.

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB):  I though you would...  Octopi have eight hands (or
legs; with them I figue they're about the same).  And, isn't economics
supposed to be the miserable science?  Hence: economisery.

<p>
(BOOB): No comment.  Heh, heh, heh.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
2) Note John Schultz's new postal address!
I think his phone number is the same and that's his cell.
This is his dream house, and we all congratulate him for it!!!
Here's his description: ``I bought a house on a lake.  
Not bad for a guy who had no life just a 
couple of years ago.  Now, I work, fish, ride my motorcycle, bounce 
grandbabies on my knee, and tinker around the house.  Ain't life 
grand?"

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum;
and all that's old has turned to scum; for this world's begun to burn.''
Part of ``Into the Strange'', one of the more normal songs on
<i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i>, Kathy Acker with the Mekons.

<p>
(NOTE TO BLACKFIRE): Message received, too late to change.

<p>
(BOOB to NOTE): The logic of this... given that you did submit the press
item... escapes me, but I'm just the GM.
I wonder if Blackfire knows who he or she is.
Hey, I wonder if you know who YOU are!

<p>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY AND BRITAIN): Thank you for liberating my lone Army, but most 
of all I'd like to thank the Gamemaster for making this possible.
 
<p>
(BRITAIN RODENT):  I smell a rat.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): I wonder who will win this little skirmish in France??

<p>
(THE REICH to THE REST):  Gotta lock things up tight, guys.  Let Ukraine 
build all he likes behind the fronts, until he has no room to put his 
builds anymore (like Spain had no room to put his build tee hee).

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): Strange war is it not??

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): Is Rob Burket and idiot or what?
<i>((May I presume that you mean JOHN BurketT, the Red Sox pitcher?
I merely think he is someone who didn't think about the ramifications
of his statement.
I really, really hope there is not a strike....))</i>
