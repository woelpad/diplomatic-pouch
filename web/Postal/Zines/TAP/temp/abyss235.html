<p><br><p><br><i>Diplomacy World</i> is reborn with Stephen Agar and myself as Co-Editors
and David Partridge as US Postal Publisher.
Scott Morris is the new variant editor.
More volunteers to get us off the ground financially and otherwise are
still being accepted.
Check out http://www.diplomacyworld.org and we'll have the first restart 
issue up before World DipCon, where we will be announcing more details,
including postal subscription plans.
See you all in Baltimore, I hope!!

<p>
Also there will be some discussion in Baltimore about postal Boardman/Miller Numbers.
Sorry to disappoint Pete Gaughan, but I will NOT be reprinting the highlights
of some recent E-Mail about these issues.
If any of you have any opinions about the future of Miller numbers, please
talk to Lee Kendter, Jr. at World DipCon.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
This will be going up finally soon as the amount I lose on every paid subscription
rises.
Get your resubs in now and then I'll go up by 50% later this year.
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
But there are some other options.
Mark Kinney is trying to get his dipszine going again (one game is
already filled), but he may have other openings.
Mark is looking for standbys too.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR GREGORY STEWART (PLUS LEFTOVER SARA REICHERT TALK)</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Gregory Stewart acquired most of his fame in Mark Luedi's <i>Thirty Miles
of Bad Road</i> szine and then also wrote lots of press for Don Williams
and others before fading away.
It is possible or even probable that Mark Luedi knows of Mr. Stewart's
whereabouts, but since Mark has been silent for quite awhile, I'll welcome
hearing from him in any case.  I think someone else suggested that we
look for a ``Mike Stewart" who I don't personally recall.
If you are looking for Gregory Stewart and happen to find Mike Stewart,
that is good too and I'll give an additional bonus prize.
I have no idea whether Mike and Gregory Stewart ever had any relationship
to each other.
But I know we have some BIG Gregory Stewart fans around here.
While we're looking, I expect some of you to write about him 
for print to generate more interest.
Fifty bucks for finding him before the deadline for issue 240.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

IT'S ALL KATHY CARUSO'S FAULT, BLAME HER!</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
So there I was in 1994, barely alive.  Now I know most people do not like to 
read or hear the sordid details of somebody else's health problems, so let me 
just say that had I belonged to a penny-pinching  HMO, I'd probably be dead 
now.  Blue Cross/Blue Shield to the rescue, but, by the time I was well 
enough to write again, I had NMRed all my games and had a lot of 
subscriptions to Diplomacy zines had run out.  

<p>
``For Idle Minds and Idle Hands, The Devil Finds a Work To Do".  Such as 
re-reading the beginner's pamphlet <i>MASTERS OF DECEIT</i> and re-reading Kathy 
Caruso's article titled ``Diplomacy-A Man's Hobby".   Go re-read it yourself 
now before continuing with this article.  PLEASE remember that all this was 
six years ago, and my mind was fogged with drugs, so I am not sure just what 
my mental processes were at that time.  At first I found it hard to believe 
Kathy's basic premise of how gullible males can be around women players.  
Being of a scientific nature, somewhere in all this I wondered about an 
experiment.  And so was born Sara Reichert.

<p>
Most people knew of my PO BOX address.  Few knew that I actually lived at 
20805 Margaret, renting a room from a lady with the very real name of 
Patricia Reichert.  So my landlady suddenly had a new daughter, age 16.   And 
things ran away from me.  Boy, did they run away.  

<p>
For example, here is what Kathy had to say about starting out:  ``As a female 
novice you can use the `dumb broad' routine by playing helpless and stupid.  
You can write and ask some `macho' man if he can help you because you are so 
confused.  You'd be surprised how many knights in shining armor play 
DIPLOMACY."  Such as Eric Ozog in Sara's very first game in the zine 
<i>CHEESECAKE</i>, where she was France, Eric was Germany, and Sara went on to an 18 
center win after stabbing her sweetie Eric for Munich and rolling over him to 
victory.   

<p>
Kathy's next paragraph read:  ``Once you figure out how to play, never let 
anyone know.  Continue to play the part of the dizzy female and just wait to 
catch them with their pants down (to coin a phrase).  Then strike, and make 
it a stab they'll never forget.  When they write and complain just say, 
`so-and-so made me do it.  He told me that you were going to stab me, and if 
I made these moves I could save my country.  Why would he lie to me?'   Then 
apologize for falling for so-and-so's line.  Then stab the sucker again".

<p>
And that is not quite how Sara won her second game.  Playing England, her 
ally, France, NMRed a winter season and did not get two builds.  Sara stabbed 
for Holland and Belgium and apologized profusely to the standby who took 
over.  After kissing and making up, the alliance continued a few more game 
years until Sara was ready for her second stab of France, which took her from 
11 to 14 to 17 to 22,

<p>
And in the paragraph after that, Kathy said:  ``You probably won't be able to 
get away with this for long, so now you need a new strategy.  I like 
flirting; it never hurts to call a guy `cute' or honey."  This happens to be 
one game where flattery gets you everything." 

<p>
Sara used that in her third game, which ended as an A/I draw.  Playing 
Austria, she soon had Italy as a solid ally.  The climax came when A/I turned 
west.   Austria had 9 SCs, Italy had 8 SCs, France had 5, and England had 12. 
 I figured that in about 1 more game year Italy would have been perfectly set 
up for the big stab and another Australian 18 center win.  I had voted ``yes" 
on a proposed A/I draw, mostly to impress the GM, Andy Lischett of 
<i>CHEESECAKE</i>.   I was flabbergasted when England also agreed to the A/I draw.  
With 12 SCs? 
Stupid blunder on my part.

<p>
After that, the word was out that Sara had brains.  No more easy wins or 
draws.  But the entire hobby did award her the 1998 ``John Koning Memorial 
Award For Best Player In The Diplomacy Hobby."  The hoax continued mostly out 
of inertia, not for any valid reason.  Simple as that.

Jim;
Congrats on the work and traveling.  Don Williams is a long-time friend 
of the BAGGIES (Bay Area Gamers Group) and one of my opponents
in my first ever 7 person FTF Diplomacy Game.  Quite a fellow for scoping 
out fraud.
   
<p>
To Harry and Sara - what a wonderful charade.  If someone were to do it, 
I'm not surprised it was you, Harry.  This gets lots of points for my 
favorite Dip machinations ever.  Not only to start over with a new persona 
but a different sex persona, ala Kathy Caruso!  Great.
   
<p>
According to FBI studies, repeatedly, a majority of young women in chat 
rooms are middle-aged men.  Go figure.  Did my son cross-dressing for 
Halloween three years in a row predict his future?
   
<p>
Speaking of my 13 yo son.  I just returned from the AAU National 
Basketball tournament where he and his team played in the appropriate age 
group.  112 13-and under teams from around the country.  Tallest player 
6'10" at age 12 and actually moved well.  One team averaged 6'6" on the 
front line.  One 6'5", two 6'4", 7 were 6'3" and 12 6'2".  These kids were 
phenomenal athletes.  Some are already recruited to private high schools.  
College coaches are present.  His team is not really big, not very fast, not 
very experienced and not fundamentally skilled.  I had hoped they would win 
25-50% and they were 2-3.  They are great in NorCal but only averge very 
good, not great.  Now comes the CA Olympic games with 5,000 student athletes 
in San Diego 7/14 and then ARC National Tournament in Las Vegas with about 
120 teams for the national age group championships.  Then he, an atheist, is 
playing in the Maccabe games for the Jewish national championships.  At the 
end of that tournament, he will have played approximately 70 official games 
this year.  Incredible to me.
   
<p>
Edi Birsan (organizer extraordinaire), Chuff Afflerback (CNN 
producer-director) and I have had further conversations about filming a Dip 
game, such as the WDC this summer, all negotiations on camera/tape, and 
packaging the show for sale to a network.  I can't see why Hasbro wouldn't 
support it, and we couldn't have a substantial prize.  Anyone who has a 
talent that could contribute to this effort such as tv network/cable; sales, 
marketing, hubris, etc. please contact one of us.  There is an outside 
possibility that we will have more formal discussions over the weekend of 
7/8 while playing some games - however the major focus will be a midnight 
broom hockey game.
   
<p>
I have not watched Survivor.  It has not been on when I run indoors - the 
only time I watch tv.  I might have to break down and watch, however.  I 
understand that various European networks have done this before - definitely 
Sweden.  The SF Lawyer woman was voted off, apparently a popular choice.  
How about setting up a quick contest - name the three finalists and the 
winner?  I will pay for a one month's subscription per legitimate entrant 
(Sara can enter as can Harry) subscriber (12 entrants, winner gets a year) for 
the winner.  You can enter.  I guess that means I'd have to define the point 
system.  Something simple.  Two points for each of the three finalists 
correctly identified, three points for the winner, ties decided by listing 
the last player voted off the island and if still tied, split the months.  
Deadline would have to be to me within 7 days of your pubbing date.

<i>((I have been commenting extensively about Survivor on the Usenet group
rec.games.diplomacy but I decided not to reprint that whole discussion here. 
The game is moving much too fast for the contest, I think.
By the time you are setting (I'd allow until August 1), they will be down to
only seven.
Still, I'd go with Richard, Kelly, and Susan - with Kelly as the winner -
as I've been arguing for some weeks at this writing.
But, by August 1, I may have changed my opinion as Kelly weakened quite a bit
in this last episode a few days before I am writing this.

<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Emmert (Mon, 10 Jul 2000 14:03:43 -0400)</b>

<p>
Dear Jim-Bob -
I will admit to being ambivalent about the discovery of Sara Reichert's
alter ego.  I am a bit surprised that it lasted this long, as I would
have expected someone would have smelled a rat long before now.  And the
sociological considerations of playing as an ostensibly ingenuous female
were very, very interesting to consider.

<p>
But I was troubled by the entire scheme, as it implies a degree of
out-of-game dishonesty that I am hard-pressed to put down to mere
tactics.  Within the game, of course, dishonesty is a perfectly
legitimate tactic.  But creating a false identity is, in my view, beyond
within-the-game tactics.  I doubt I'll ever believe a thing Harry says
from this point on.  And as the present generation of Diplo-mercenaries
may learn with time, there is a very real value in this hobby (even
within the context of a given game) to personal credibility.  Harry will
never have that again.

<p>
I recognize that many players will view this as no big deal.  And many
others will raise an eyebrow, but eventually put it down as just another
tactic of deception that fits perfectly well within the rules of the
game.  But I don't agree, and I don't think I'm alone.  Harry is
certainly not the first Dipper to play under a false identity; my sense
is that the ones who did so before became hobby pariahs (at least within
the postal hobby; I can't speak for what goes on online).  

<p>
So, am I hopelessly old-fashioned, or what?

<p><br><p><br><b>Phil Reynolds (Sun, 16 Jul 2000 09:32:47 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<p>
Jim - Here's my experience with the whole Harry/Sara
thing....
   
<p>
I was aware of Harry Andruschak, mainly from
seeing his name in various zines, but also from
contacting me about an <i>ishkibibble</i> sample or sub,
before I heard of Sara. I started seeing Sara's
name popping up in zines, and I had no reason to
think the two were related.
   
<p>
At some point, Sara contacted me about playing
in a Dip variant in my zine, but the game had
already filled up, so I asked if I could use her
as a standby for it, and she said yes. (All of
this communication was by letter.)
   
<p>
Well, wouldn't you know, one of my players
dropped out of the game, and I needed a
ready-and-willing standby, and Sara seemed the
obvious choice. However, I wanted a confirmation
from her that, in fact, she would be willing to
accept the role as a replacement player.
   
<p>
So I called Information in California that
weekend, giving Sara's street address, to get her
phone number. When I called it, a man answered
the phone. I asked to speak to Sara, but when the
man said Sara wasn't home, I asked if he would
tell her to call me regarding playing in a
Diplomacy game, and the man agreed to do so.
   
<p>
I think it was the next day that I got a call
from Harry. I can't recall if he said he was a
friend of Sara's, but I distinctly remember him
asking me about one of my house rules (which I
publish occasionally and which Harry must have
seen), stating in part that deception of the GM
(me) will result in a person being permanently
banned from my zine. Harry asked if I was serious
about this, and I said yes. It was then that he
told me he was Sara. (I believe he later added
something about not wanting to lie to me because
I was on chemotherapy at the time. This would
have been around the fall of 1997 and winter of
1998.) 
   
<p>
I told him that although I would not reveal
his secret to anybody, I did not want him playing
under a pseudonym in my zine. He seemed to accept
this and thus declined to play as Sara in my
zine, although he did express interest as himself
in some game openings and being a standby.
   
<p>
Not too long after Harry's revelation, Sara
and I started getting into games together. I
simply signed up for games as I normally would.
When it came time to make opening negotiations in
one of the games, I made a closing comment on a
postcard to Sara to the effect that, ``If you
don't do what I want you to do, I'll let everyone
know who you really are."
   
<p>
Now was I serious about this threat? I really
don't think so. I was just trying to scare Harry
into doing what I wanted him to do, which was be
my ally. Sure, this is not the best way to make
an ally, but when someone hems and haws about
being an ally in a Dip game, you might have to
switch quickly to a fallback strategy (which
Harry later deemed blackmail).
   
<p>
Instead, Sara dropped out of the game, as well
as almost every other future game that had us
together as players. Fine by me - I wanted to
play in these games, and if Harry was so scared
that his ruse would be exposed, so be it. He just
didn't want to take any chances with me, it
seems.
  
<p>
 A few months back, I asked readers of my zine
(including Harry) what they thought about people
playing under pseudonyms in hobby games. In the
following issue, I gave my take on this (as I
relate below), but I was extremely careful not to
identify Harry or Sara as the people who had
prompted my question. Further, when I had e-mail
conversations with some other hobby publishers
and came to realize that they knew who I was
talking about, I still never identified Harry or
Sara. (It was like we knew who each other meant
without saying exactly who they were!)
   
<p>
A brief while later, I got a short, scathing
letter from Harry, accusing me of blackmailing
him in our earlier game and stating, ``Publish and
be damned!" I reminded Harry that I had never
named him or Sara in any discussion and that he
was overreacting.
   
<p>
And I once again made my plea to him to give
up his hoax. He had perpetrated it successfully
for several years, and I thought now was the
perfect time to make good on the promise he made
in that revelatory phone call, which was that he
would fess up at some point. But he simply wasn't
ready to do so yet.
   
<p>
So I dropped the whole thing and had no
intention of giving any more attention to the
whole Harry/Sara thing ... until Jim Burgess
splashed the whole affair in his last issue of
<i>TAP</i> - and thus this letter, for what it's worth.
   
<p>
Let me end by making one point clear: I do not
have a problem with someone playing under a
pseudonym, as long as he doesn't cheat by using
it to control more than one power in a game, or 
doesn't imitate a real person with the same name,
or doesn't play under the pseudonym in my zine. I
think it's a very clever and laudable thing if
someone pulls it off effectively and honestly,
and Harry certainly seems to have done that, so
many kudos to him for a ploy well plotted.

Jim, I was not aware of any male-female impersonations (or vice-versa) 
in PBM Diplomacy in the brief time I was in the hobby (early 70's). 
John Boardman should know about the early years (you trade with him 
as I see by his sub list). 
<i>((And John also knows Harry very well from the Science Fiction hobby
and I suspect John will weigh in on this shortly.))</i>
I attended a DipCon in Chicago in 73(?) where I met some early stalwarts of 
the hobby (Conrad von Metzke, Len Lakofka, Walt Buchanan, John Boyer and Edi Birsan  
plus our `founder' Allan Calhamer - these names and faces I remember). 
I had also heard of the name Buddy Tretick as a player (but only because 
Rod Walker mentioned him) I met Buddy this last Mar at Vancouver airport 
and he filled me in on that particular `tete a tete'). 
I came into PBM by signing up in Rod Walker's Wild 'n' Wooley (my first game was 72D). 
This is it, all the name-dropping I am capable of and I, a peripheral player. 
As you can see, a fraction of all the 'names' in the hobby. 
I like history so there, you have mine.

I had lots of fun proving it with Don Williams and visiting Harry in

The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll either find a commercial service or perhaps buy some new
equipment to get the copying done.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.

<p>
Dear Jim,
I hope you have a nice summer over there.  Myself, I am enjoying every bit
of it since we have bad weather, something I'd prefer to last summer
when we had sunshine and intense heat for most of the season.

<p>
I saw in the letter column last issue that you have Survivor now, in
Sweden it's called Expedition Robinson and we are looking forward to
the third season now. The first season was great with a cop winning the
title and after he got all tangled up in the B league of famous people,
photos in the tabloid press and celebrity parties all the way.

<p>
In the Swedish version they start out in four different teams and when
some are gone they are transferred to two teams that battle it out. Team
South, four young male made an alliance from the start that they should
all be in the final four, the thing was plotted by a hard core stalinist
revolutionary.  The others didn't have a chance, they never knew what hit
them and in the end the four of them were the last standing.
In the second season there was a HUGE argument between a girl who was
vegetarian and extreme animal rights involved. That year they had a goat
on the island and after a while someone got the idea of making him in to
a barbecue, they were all hungry and agreed that it was a good idea
apart from the animal rights girl, and she receives all kind of supports
from groups like Animal Liberation Front.

<p>
I also saw that you talked about Survivor diplomacy. We have played a
variant based on the program a few times called Robinson Diplomacy:
All the normal rules apply. Starting with winter 1903 one is voted out,
the one with the most centers is immune to the vote (in the Swedish
version holding the statue), if more than one have equal number of
centers, count back is used.
Every uneven ( 03,05,07 and so forth) winter this is repeated untill
there is two left, then all vote at the same time. Every even winter a
price competion is held conducted by the GM, this time the one with the
most growth since the last price competition is the winner, The GM decides
beforehand what the reward is.

<p>
Some examples:

<p>
 One free unbreakable support

<p>
 An extra unit somewhere.

<p>
 Can change armies into fleets and vice versa

<p>
 Can not be attacked by a combination of units from different powers.

<p>
 Get to nuke one area.

<p>
This is a fun variant and if you feel like opening a waiting list sign
me on :-)

<p>
BTW I will send you some money soon to boost my credit.
Did you receive the music CD I sent you?

Jim;
Summer is going very well out here, great weather, time with the kids, 
new girlfriend, good little bands.  I saw Roy Rogers and Shanna Morrison 
last night.  I hadn't realized they had a CD or two out and were playing a 
lot together.  There was way too little of his playing slide or bottleneck.  
He can play some sweet, sweet notes.  They were very eclectic - Irish only a 
couple, blue grass, ballads, blues, pop, Mose Allison, Will the Circle Be 
Unbroken, and on.  Pleasant.  Too slow for me.
   
<p>
I keep being tempted to alter my life by returning to large venues and to 
plan ahead to be one place one day - to see BBKing, Buddy Guy, Susan 
Tedeschi and Tommy Castro at one of their stops on their major summer tour.  
I think I have too many great memories of each to try to approach a Zen-Be 
Here Now attitude and enjoy the whole thing.

Richard's letter in <i>TAP</i> 234 was about the third time this year I've seen
discussion of Sea of Despair that lacked knowledge of its origins.  Not
that it'll ever get to the point that royalties are involved, but here's
the history for what it's worth.  In the early- to mid-Eighties, Mark
Luedi's zine <i>Thirty Miles of Bad Road</i> had a frequent contributor named
Gregory Stewart.  He didn't play a lot of Dip, but he wrote stories
involving his ``Desperate Man" character.  One issue he put the Desperate
Man on a spaceship with all the zine's subscribers, insufficient
supplies, and no spacesuits.  The readers were invited to vote on whom
to eject in order to stretch supplies for the rest.  The top five
votegetters each month were sent out the airlock.  This went pretty
well, but I don't recall if it was completed before the zine folded.  A
year or two later, Tom Swider decided he wanted an
audience-participation game for one of his subzines - it might have
been ``Expletive Deleted" in the groupzine <i>Coat of Arms</i>.  The setting
was moved to a ship at sea, people got multiple votes to toss people
overboard or help save people, and the ejection criterion became ``over
20 votes" rather than ``the five people with most votes".  The name was
``Sea of Despair", though it later got called ``Chuck 'em Overboard"
elsewhere.  Like most simple good ideas, it got done to death and has
largely faded away.

<p>
Until the TV networks, ever lacking in good ideas, copied a European
show using a similar concept.  Frankly, Jim, I find fawning over a TV
show to be more offensive than fawning over a zine poll.  I can
participate in my own activities (silly and unproductive as some like
Dip may be) rather than waste time and electricity staring at people so
superficial they'll do anything to be on TV.  If someone gave me a
television, I'd trade it for a computer upgrade or a pile of German
boardgames.

<p><br><p><br><b>Mark Lew (Mon, 17 Jul 2000 17:06:52 -0700)</b>
From:  (Mark D Lew)

<p>
The name of Jerry Lucas's alter ego was Judy Winsome.  That's from my era.
<i>((I was never in doubt about the Winsome/Lucas issue.
It was Leslie Obata's name that I was searching for.
But thanks anyway.
If it was an excuse that made you write, then it worked!))</i>
You've got a lot of old farts on your list, so you've probably already
heard this from someone who got the zeen sooner.

<p>
I moved more than a month ago, but I never got around to sending out a COA
notice. I'm now at: 5241 Manila Avenue, Oakland, CA 94618.
It's just a few blocks from where I used to be.

<p>
Oh, reading along I see that Brenton has already mentioned Judy Winsome's
name.  I corresponded with Judy quite a bit. I don't recall exactly when
that was. His zeen first appeared when <i>Voice of Doom</i> was still around,
whenever that was. It might have been before I moved to California, and I'm
sure it was before Pete moved to California. (It wasn't until after Pete
arrived that the No Calif crowd started getting together FTF.)

<p>
I think the Judy Winsome alias was different from these others you're
discussing because Judy's identity was never really a secret. It was pretty
much common knowledge that Judy was really a man, but we all addressed our
letters to Judy anyway. It was sort of an experiment in gender identity.
Jerry was interested in that, and so was I, so we discussed it a bit. He
did mention once that he wore a dress to some event - I think it had
something to do with a girl's sports team he coached (soccer? softball? I
don't remember). He said it was fun, but it didn't sound like a serious
transvestite experience. Since then I've done some cross-dressing (eg,
Halloween on the Castro). It's great fun, but I don't think of myself as a
real transvestite.

<p>
The thing about the SF area is that things like cross-dressing aren't too
unusual, so it's easy to find your own interest level. If you live
somewhere else, maybe you wonder about it and think, ``oh my god, am I a
queer?" or whatever, and you never really know what the story is.  Here, if
you're curious about wearing a dress, you just try it. Maybe you like it or
maybe you don't, but before long you figure out exactly what level of
interest you. For me, once a year is more than enough, and then only with
the right sort of friends to hang out with. (The most fun I had was with my
crazy lesbian friend and her straight roommate.) The most fascinating thing
is how women interact with you. Especially if they can't tell (in my youth,
when I had long hair and a flat stomach, I could ``pass"; I'm not sure if I
still could) but even afterward. Also, you'd be amazed how many straight
women are turned on by a man dressed as a woman, particularly younger
women. Your wife is in the drama crowd, so you probably know what I'm
talking about.
<i>((Absolutely, I have known lots of cross-dressers and tried it once
myself too - but way back in college before I grew my beard.))</i>

<p>
But I digress. Jerry lived in Santa Clara, I think - somewhere in the
South Bay.  As I recall, he had a daughter who was around late high school
or early college age. That means she's probably in her late 20s now. I'm
sure he mentioned her name, but I don't remember it now.

<p>
As you know, America's history-based movies are loaded with
misrepresentations, but with enough truth to pass as plausible for the bulk
of the audience. I never watch movies, but the soc.history newsgroups are
always full of debunking of Gladiator, 13th Warrior, Braveheart, etc.  Even
the History Channel delivers an occasional blunder, in addition to the
steady supply of mild distortion and coverage of pseudo-history like King
Arthur, Atlantis etc.

<p>
I can no longer claim that I don't remember the last movie I saw in the
theater. It was an ongoing puzzle for me. I know it has been several years.
The last movies I know I saw are more than five years old, but I have a
vague recollection of seeing something in Berkeley some time around 1997.
Anyway, a few weeks ago, one of my married friends who calls me when her
husband is out of town (nothing naughty) called out of the blue and said
let's go see a movie. I wasn't really in the mood, but she knows me well,
so she let me dither for a while and then made her decision and told me
where and when to meet her. It wasn't exactly mainstream Hollywood, some
quasi-documentary about marijuana, playing at Berkeley's ``artsy" theater.
But I was assured that it really is a new release, so I guess it counts as
a ``movie". The thing I noticed was that the sound was ridiculously loud,
enough that I found it painful occasionally. I asked my date about this,
and she said it was completely normal. Wow. If I ever see an action film,
I'll be sure to wear earplugs. Seriously.

<p>
I saw SFO's Parsifal a few days ago. They were papering the house for the
last night, so there were plenty of loose comps floating around among my
singer friends. I got confused about the start time, so I showed up about
40 minutes late. They let us in anyway, to the bottom-level standing-room
area, for the rest of act one. The funny thing about Parsifal is that you
can be 40 minutes late and really not miss anything.  It's about 15 minutes
of plot set to four hours of music. I don't really love Wagner, especially
not late Wagner, so I almost didn't go. But it was free, and I had nothing
else to do that afternoon, so I figured it would be silly to pass it up. I
didn't love it, but I did stay interested through the whole piece, which
frankly is more than I expected. The star (in my opinion, and apparently
most everyone else's) was Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz. What a magnificent voice.
I think he's about 70 now, but he still sounds great.

<p>
I still like 'Merkin football, so I hope it doesn't die or get WWFified.
This year I've finally gotten into baseball in earnest. I used to (in
theory, but never actively) root for the Mariners, because of the Alaska
connection and because my sister is a big fan, but now that I'm actually
watching, I've switched to the A's.  The odd thing is that I sort of like
all three of the other teams in the division, too (presumably because
they're familiar), so I root for them when they're not playing the A's. Not
very logical, I know, but there it is. I like that the A's have somehow
managed to be contenders without joining the high-payroll club. Last year,
they had the highest win-per-payroll ratio. This year they're down to about
fifth. If the point is to measure effectiveness of money spent (and I think
it is) a better statistic would be to count deviation from .500 (rather
than from .000) and divide that by the payroll. On those terms, I think
Oakland would be on top again. I forget the list, but I think the other
teams were all below .500.

<p>
Some day I might actually try seeing a game live. They have some
ludicrously low-priced specials for non-peak-day games, and there's never
any question about being able to get a ticket. But for now I'm happy with
just watching on TV. Of course I always root against the SF Giants, too.
Primarily because I hate SF's imperialistic attitude, but now also because
they're fans are so ornery.  I've seen other parks with loud and
enthusiastic fans, but Pac Bell is so far the only one I've seen where they
routinely boo. Half the time I can't even figure out what they're booing
about.  What a bunch of miserable punks.

<p>
The basic Overboard game has been around for decades at least. It was
certainly not invented by Dipsters.  I've never seen the TV show. It sounds
like a conflation of the two big trends in television - the new,
high-stakes game shows, and the ``real world" stuff - neither of which I
care for.  I hate the new quiz shows. Ben Stein's money was bad enough,
with sloppier questions and too much time wasted on dumb jokes. The
millionaire shows extend the trend farther: there are even fewer questions
per hour, and the questions are even dumber (plus they're multiple choice,
like an SAT).  Bleah, give me Jeopardy anyday (or more precisely, five days
a week).  My brother-in-law has been bugging me to go to LA and try out
again.  I'm not as quick as I used to be, but I'm sure I can still pass the
test, and now I'll be a much better screen-test candidate than I was
before. When was it? About six years ago, I think.

<i>((Thanks for some wideranging comments, as usual.
Some time I'd like to you to comment on Al Gore as a Presidential Candidate.
You still were very influential in getting me to look DEEPLY at him back in
the 1980's and as a result I see him today as the VERY best possible type of
person who could evolve from our current system.  
Not the perfect Presidential candidate I could IMAGINE, but the best I could
hope for.
I realize that you have ignored politics pretty steadily for the last decade,
but there it is.
As I look at Ralph Nader again, he seems even more pathetic than the last time.
Can any single man carry such repressed guilt around and still live??
He seems to hate America (I think you have to be some kind of glass half full
sort of person or it's all over) and he has achieved multi-millionaire riches
while gradually getting further and further away from his original consumer
little guy focus.
Amazing.

I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has stepped out of the sixth spot,
so we now need THREE more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).
Not much action here, but I'll keep the opening for now.

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've forgotten just this instant
who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/about_this_site.htm

<p>
(TARTAKOWSKY VILLAGE, A BURG NEAR THE MOSCOW-UKRAINIAN BORDER [White 
Russia in circa 1900 ... Calhamer, you drunk then?]  WET BIRDSEED AND 
GUTTER DROPPINGS PRESS):  While the Kaiser was washing everything down 
with a beer or two [more like three cases], the Tzar was still trying to 
climb out of that spittoon.  The Tzar, now a shrunken mess, or so his 
wife told him, was making his way up through the Kaiser's nasal 
passages, finding an opening in the Kaiser's throat.  When the Kaiser 
opened his mouth, the normal state of things, the Tzar saw the light at 
the end of a somewhat nasty smelling tunnel.  While almost falling down 
the slimy throat of the Kaiser, the Tzar climbed further up onto the 
tongue, from those deep caverns, in spite of the noise of the chimes 
caused by those darned German tonsils [I had offered to take out his 
tonsils many times over the past years ... no avail].  Then it came ... 
that onrush of beer.  The Tzar bit into the tongue of the Kaiser in a 
vain attempt to hold on.  However, biting slime is still biting slime. 
Swoosh!  Down the proverbial tubes once more in the life.  The Tzar now 
wonders just which orifice his final escape will be from the Kaiser's 
body.  He took out his emory board and began sharpening his nails, so 
that an attempt to grip the tissue would improve.  The Tzar chuckled as 
his thoughts went from dismal, to terrorizing, knowing the pain he would 
cause the Kaiser with those nails.  ``He will either think he is passing 
a kidney stone, or that fish bone he swallowed is trying to get out of 
his rectum!" screeched the Tzar, as he was flushed further and further 
through the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestines, and ... oh, 
no, not the large intestines!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) We are trying to fix the map.  No map this issue, but we should have
a fixed one next time.

<p>
2) The presence of ``South Pacific Ocean'' on both sides of the map 
confused me a bit last time, so England ended up with a unit there
as well as Austria.
The Austrian move was supported, though, so it really is there
and the English move from Antarctic bounces.
See the correction above.

<p>
3) John Power is in the process of moving, no new permanent address yet.
He wants his old address to be used, which will be forwarded to him.
He also has his work E-Mail address back, but use it sparingly.
He will have a private E-Mail address again soon too.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-SPAIN): Movement is for position against Ottoman no other 
though I need some fleet north of me to get to them like I said in the 
e-mail.

<p>
(OTTO-SPAIN): Well done!
You have outplayed me again!!!

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-AUSTRIA): I've tried writing and I can't seem to manage it -

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-GM): So you on a bright sunny day for Netherlands it's full of 
stormy nights.

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-RUSSIA, BRITAIN): So you've taken over everything of my homeland 
eh. Oh well better luck next time. For I still have Spain to work with. 
Unless you count China in e-mail Diplomacy.

<p>
(SEAN-JIM-BOB): Hey in Ed Prem's e-mail Diplomacy I was doing pretty good as 
Russia, such a shame that not enough players were all that dedicated so it 
was scratched.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Heath still tries his ``ostrich'' approach and continues to stay
in last place.
Lots of other maneuvering (including some more nukes withheld)
as we work towards the end.... and even some who launch their
nukes (e.g. Mike Barno) don't do so to any great effect.
Of course, Mike does nuke me again though, so I continue my efforts
to match your totals for Supply Centers with my number of Nukes.
I'm four ahead of Heath at the moment, but it looks like Heath may
be able to pick up three this turn, possibly more if he actually
moves.

<p>
2) Reminder: again I am capitalizing the first letter of the province of the
last location for units that are annihilated by nukes.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(``MIKE BARNO"):  Since Harry ``came out" with the identity of his Sara
persona, I must now admit that there has never been a ``Mike Barno" in
real life.  I (Marie Beyerlein) was curious in the late Seventies to see
whether an incredibly goofy person could win by playing in ways that
would confound opponents who thought too conventionally.  Since then, it
has just been so much fun for 22 years that I never wanted to stop.  But
since the Reichert pseudonym has been exposed, this seems like a good
time to end the Barno hoax.

<p>
(SWEET SARA-RICHARD): Your press to me in <i>TAP</i>-234 read like a veiled threat.  
I hate veiled threats directed at me, and that explains the five nukes 
directed at you.   Of course, that press last issue could have been black 
press NOT by you.  If so, you have my apologies and my assurances that it 
won't happen again.  My plans for 1907 are to once again nuke Heath Gardner 
to oblivion, unless somebody gives me cause to reconsider my priorities.   

<p>
(RICHARD - SARA): Notice my pattern of nukes this time, trying to make a 
very long string, so you can have lots of potential paths to count up the 
maximum number of holes which can be traversed.  I believe female brains, 
due to less testosterone in utero, are much better at that sort of thing 
than male brains.  About the only thing female brains are better at, I might 
add.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): At the moment, the Reichert/McDuffie 
household does not have a cat.  This was not always the case.  Back before 
Patricia Reichert married Phil McDuffie (yes, the Black man who chuckled all 
the time at the hoax going on for over six years, and who did a superb job of 
answering the phone as Sara's step-Father), we did have a cat, given to us by 
a friend who no longer had the time for its care.  It annoyed my landlady no 
end that the cat preferred me to her, and often slept with me, even though 
she was the one feeding the brute.   Two reasons crop to mind.

<p>
1) Pat was the one who took her to the vet.  Cats resent the vet and hold 
grudges against those who take them there.  

<p>
2) At the time, I still snored quite loudly.  It may be that she liked to 
sleep on my chest because she thought I was purring in my sleep.  But who 
knows what really goes on in the mind of a cat?

<p>
Anyhow, Phil is mildly allergic to cats, so the cat now belongs to Pat's REAL 
daughter.  Yes, Pat has a real daughter and a real son.  I should mention 
that Pat and Phil intend to sell their house in the future, and I will be 
required to move on.   I am not sure what I will do.  Home of my own?  
Townhouse?  Condo?  Rent or lease?  In any case, rest assured that I intend 
to have at least one cat and spoil them rotten.  

<p>
Now about Sara's cats.  I have a lot of friends who have cats.  If YOU have a 
lot of friends who have cats, you know that those friends like to tell cute 
stories about their cute cats.  So I recycled their cute stories about their 
cute cats as Sara's cute stories about her cute cats.   Only the names were 
changed to protect the guilty.   They made her letters and e-mail more 
convincing.   To make things easier, I based her cat, Whisky, on a cat I 
lived with back in 1956-1958, when I was living with my Grandparents in 
Sladegreen, Erith, Kent, England, UK.

<p>
(BUD-SARA): I still think you are cute.  My last girl friend was named 
``G-L-O-R-I-A."  Maybe you knew each other.  Seems my current new girl friend 
knows all my ex-girl friends and my ex-wife as well.  Sheesh.  So much for 
being anonymous in a metropolitan area.

<p>
(AUSTRIA-HEATHEN GARDEN): Ever hear that old phrase, ``Blow up or shut up!" 
That's what I'm telling you.  Either blow me up (no, not the way Sara 
does)as you promised, or shut up.  Go Ahead. Blast my trap shut.  If you 
did, I think you wasted some of your explosions, but man, I like the 
rocking.

<p>
(SWEET SARA-CALCUTTA): Too bad none of your lawyers knew the difference 
between a copyright and a trademark.  Copyrights lapse after a certain number 
of years, and any copyrights for the phrase ``Black Hole of Calcutta" have 
long since lapsed.   I doubt if you could have trademarked the term ``Black 
Hole" all by itself, but ``Black Hole of Calcutta" would have made it and 
still be in force.  I suggest you execute all those lawyers who gave you bad 
advice.  Do not worry about world reaction to this slaughter, most will 
regard it as ``a good start".

<p>
(RICHARD-JODY):  Next issue of <i>TAP</i> and you will be reporting that you are 
really a woman after all.  And all without benefit of the East German 
steroid treatment regime.

<p>
(JODY to ALL): Most of the recent press from ``Jody" was not from me. Everyone
who got me last time got a nuke from me this time. Revenge isn't quite as
much fun as winning, but it's close!

<p>
(SENSITIVE MAN to BARNOBOY): I realize that my press to you has been too 
abusive and that your feelings have been hurt.  Therefore I am intentionally 
NMR'ing this turn, to heal my wounded id, to make amends and to show that I 
am really a nice guy after all.  Besides, I wouldn't have been able to get 
more than 5 points this time.

<p>
(RACOUNTER to SADDAM): In the far desert, far over the fourth sand dune, 
there are three camels staked next to a small tent.  The camels are facing 
East, for the winds are from the West, and the sand grains are snapping into 
their faces and hair.  With such force that the middle camel does not want 
to lift it's tail to defecate.  But, the story about the middle camel is for 
tomorrow night.

<p>
Tonight, Saddie Boy, the story focuses inside the small tent, next to the 
three camels, far over the fourth sand dune from here.  Inside the tent all 
is calm.  The only sounds are an occassional muffle from the third camel, 
the flap flap flip-flap of the tent, and the song from the six canaries.  
The sheik is letting his turban down, relaxing for the night, preparing to 
open the camel skin bags containing the only slightly soured cheeses from 
the last WebVan delivery, the wine and the bird seed for his canaries.
   
<p>
Ah, but you are already sleeping, Saddie.  I will tell you about the 
canary cages and the songs they sing another night.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The concession to Austria fails.
Someone wants it to be recorded that they vote ``screw Austria'', but this cannot
be verified by the GM and it gets recorded as an abstention in any case ;-)
This time a concession to Germany is proposed.
Please vote with your Summer orders.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to AUSTRIA): Here, take Mos without a fight! No go away!

<p>
(I to F): Not what we planned. Call me.

<p>
(ABOARD THE BRANTSCHPOHL, ADMIRAL PAUL VON SHERRHODT GIVES THE ORDER TO OPEN FIRE): 
``Let the Fuzzyheaded Turks and Cossacks feel the iron and steel rain 
down upon them.  Let this Great War continue!"
 
<p>
(RUSSIA to ENGLAND): Howdy again, neighbor!

<p>
(SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRIA):
A hustle and bustle began as the keel of the Dreadnought class ship was being 
laid.  The workmen seemed to be in a frenzy and they were very excited.This 
particular ship was going to be Admiral Sherrhodt's new flagship.  Her 
launching as yet is unknown but that would not stop her production...

<p>
(ANKARA):  Whatever.  Wake me up when the pizza gets here.

<p>
(REPORTING FROM WARSAW):   
It would appear that at first light a horrendous artillery barrage had 
started.  Reports are coming in that a simultaneous offensive has begun 
stretching from the gates of Moscow all the way down to the Med.  Unconfirmed 
reports are that Italian Fleets have also joined in on the murderous 
shelling...General Flashman commanding the 15.Lancers has been in the middle 
of the fray coordinating the attack along with Field Marshal Jon 
Rhodehamel.  His units are supporting a heavily armed set of battalions which 
are at this moment trying to take the fortified city of Moscow...
Further news shall follow as the day wears on...

<p>
(ITALY to BOOB): OK, funny guy! So you like printing all the errors in 
spelling, grammar and context when it comes to GM abuse, eh? 
<i>((Of course, I want to make my attackers look as silly as they
allow themselves to look - spell check your mail if you want! ;-) - 
as well as give them ammo for more juicy GM abuse.....))</i>
Especially when 
it comes to the mighty, drunk, stumbling fingers of the Pope! A HEX on 
you!!! And what about deadlines?!?! 
Did you send my issue of <i>TAP</i> out late, just out of spite!?!? 
<i>((No, I really didn't, but you weren't the only one to have this
problem.... the USPS seems to have trouble with domestic mail.
You could move to England, my mail gets there in 2-3 days like 
clockwork.))</i>
I got it on July 10th!  
A mere 5 days to get my holy-ASS in gear! 
<i>((And a wholly prodigious ass it is....))</i>
Bad MOJO is a'cummin to you, my friend... Better get the 
little yellow slicker out...
<i>((I am not afeared.))</i>

<p>
(SCOTT to THE PERSON/PEOPLE IT CONCERNS): The plan is still in place. 
It is now just a matter of following it through.
<i>((Hmmmm, you'll forgive me if I attach a measure of doubt to the
plan's execution?
Then again, I have no idea what it is, so perhaps appearances are
mistaken.))</i>

<p>
(POPE ``SPEEDICUT" to GERMAN AMBASSADOR): Fuck'em all. 
I'm your bud.  No one 
can tell you how to run the affairs of the German people. I suggest you go 
into `turtle mode' until we can straighten everything out.

<p>
(ITALY to FRANCE): Now, what we have here, sir, is a FAILURE, to 
CO-MYUN-EEE-KATE. Keep a cool hand, my boy, and everything will play out 
fine.

<p>
(F to WORLD): Insults....INSULTS!! it's almost like that rat bastard Jim 
O'Kelley is in the game.  
<i>((While O'K is a rat bastard, out-insulting him is child's play.
You were following the game in Pete Gaughan's subszine, weren't you???))</i>
And as for insults to the GM, now that you are 
editor of <i>Dip World</i> does that mean we can award you with the biggest ego in 
the hobby?  :) DOH.  You looked good in that Hat I put on you, but Edi looked 
better.  Did you download that?
<i>((Yes, I did, and you're right, Edi looked better.
I NEVER look good in hats.....))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE): Anyone who wants to insult me to my face can find me at WDC.  
Look for a buff 
6-5 muscle bound stud with pecs the side of Kentucky.  I will be the skinny 
frail looking coward next to him with my running shoes on. 

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE VORLD):
It has begun again...You must understand...My people are vorlike! 
It is difficult to negotiate peace vhen all my nation vishes is za complete control 
of za continent!   The Emperor himself has dictated zat za Turkish people must 
get "Dead"!!! 
As for za Russians,I must quote za old saying, ``Whomever does 
not make use of za pen, shall Die by za sword!"...

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): It was a good standoff while it lasted....

is just. Thanks for the heads up. If and when that

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Buhrt looks cooked!  And the March Hare looks like he'll be cookin' for 
awhile - three of those cards in a row would take him past 100.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BUHRT - BOOB): Well, there's no point in sprinting up to 50, won't be
anyone around, so I might as well take it easy.  This old codger still
thinks he's heading for the pub soon.

<p>
(BRIT PACK):  Looks like the millennial apocalypse will be a fin de cycle for Buhrt.

<p>
(DARRELL - WHITE RABBIT): You don't want to be around when buddy Buhrt
starts displaying his wind.  Why do you think we're all up here?

<p>
(FIELD to BUHRT):  If you wanted to stay in this race till the end, you should
have been named ``Darrell D''.

<p>
(BRIT PACK): What sort of name is Buhrt anyway?  Sounds like the noise I make after 
glugging down a Pepsi.

<p>
(BOOB to BRIT PACK): I asked Buhrt to explain himself, but he'd kinda slow.
He'll get around to it eventually.

<p>
(MARK to LONGER BOOKS):  I can't wait around here all day playing single-digit
cards!  When you only have sixteen chapters you have to make every one count! 
I'm going to scout up ahead and gather some information.

<p>
(LUKE to MARK):  You sound like Martha.  She was always in a rush, too.  Sit
down for a while and rest.

<p>
(OBSERVATION):  Mr.&nbsp;Howell is starting to look pretty hard to beat.  We're
taking applications from anyone who wants to do something about it.

<p>
(MARK to ISAAC):  If you put that apple in the fridge, it could make for some
mighty fine eating this round.  Assuming Meg didn't go with me, that is.

<p>
ALICE to FIELD:  I can't tell a whole lot of difference from over
here...  The rain keeps obscuring the view!

<p>
(RABBIT - HARE):  Thanks for the 'shrooms!

<p>
(RABBIT - BOOB):  You forget wh(o)ere we are:  'Shrooms do just what we
want them to...  (apologies to Lewis Carroll)

<p>
(BOOB to RABBIT): No need to apologize, what did the Red Queen say to Alice
about that???
And even worse, remember what happened to Alice when she kept trying to
apologize to the Mouse!

<p>
(ALICE - MANIACS):  What accounting system you using?  I've got you down
for last in cards for the last 4 turns.

<p>
(MOCK TURTLE - DARRELL):  Nope!  No one went for it.  Think anyone will
charge out there this turn?

<p>
(WHITE RABBIT - ISAAC): May I have a bite of your apple?  I lost ten
bucks on his pokey lack of speed last turn.  He lost 3 points - serves
him right.

<p>
(BRIT PACK): The Flat Wheel Society look like they will finally get some points in a game 
of Breaking Away?  Next you'll be telling me the world is round.

<p>
(HATTER to TFWS):  45, ... 76 ...  Sounds like you guys are spinning in
circles.  No wonder you're slower - the track is oval not vinyl.

<p>
(RABBIT - TURTLE): Keep your feets spinning round...

<p>
(THE DESIGNER SPEAKS): So, by my calculation, I've only got to score 23 points 
more than ALICE in the last sprint stage to have any chance of winning.

<p>
(BRIT PACK): Art, Drama, Science, Mathematics - the four horsemen of the Acropolis.

<p>
(DARRELL - THE ONE WHO MAKES FUN OF REPTILES):  This ain't Deliverance
boy, up heah we just shoot folks cleanly.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): I have canceled the AOL screen name of 
tapmdfrance of aol.com, so in the future all e-mail should go to 
sarareichert of aol.com, which I am retaining for several reasons.  AOL allows 
users up to 7 screen names, and I have a need for a new screen name for other 
interests of mine.  The ``Sara" screen name is being retained since that is 
the name that matches her credit card that I have been using to buy things 
on-line.  For example, I have taken an interest to railroad games published 
by MAYFAIR GAMES INC,, whose web site is http://www.coolgames.com/, and 
used the credit card to buy IRON DRAGON.   Even better, MAYFAIR has licensed 
EDEN STUDIOS to produce a computer game version of IRON DRAGON, and I have 
used her credit card to advance order it.  This is a fun game for those of 
you who like choo-choo games.  Visit http://www.irondragon.org/ for more 
information, updates, and to download a demo version..

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I missed that Ukraine had moved to Ada, which formerly belonged to Egypt.
Thus, Ukraine builds one more and Egypt has one less than what was reported
last time.
Given that, and the Egyptian retreat that could have affected the SC chart,
I reprint the augmented and corrected one here.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Give me dark and give me greed;
give me power that I can hold; buzzin' wires it's icy cold;
you taught us well, now feel the dread; in your nerves and in your beds;
coming down all round your heads.'' an excerpt from the title track of
<i>The Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): I got the call on ADA, I did notice (really).
<i>((I believe you!))</i>
I disagree with your rule interpretation; I don't think that a unit
in retreat ought to be able to take a supply center... your game,
your rules... your interpretation.
<i>((It's not just MY interpretation, it IS the standard interpretation.
Ask anyone else in the game who has been a GM.
Comments, Dave, Paul, Eric???
Oh and John has been a GM too!))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): Off to the east we go, hey it'll be easier for you to not
support Italy he is my target all forces gunward hooo!

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN): I think now would be a good time to move your fleet in Mao
and Eng to actually do something other then hold the Atlantic this game.
Looks to be going a U/G/I alliance, nice one. 
We just got cut into three Jeff and I are split,
our forces are not longer that much capable of supporting
each other, while Ukraine and Italy attack Jeff he won't last long. 
Germany vs you and I with Italy splitting his forces, hey perfect for German 
stab in the middle. 
Or Ukrainian stab in the east, perfect. 
I think the endgame will be between Germany and Ukraine while we get 
slaughtered, the only option you have without Germany taking you out quickly 
is to move Mao into a defensive position, otherwise it'll only be a matter of 
time before German armies invade your homeland. 
I need my fleets to move east to hold back the Italian this will be an 
interesting war indeed.

<p>
(EGYPT - UKRAINE): Stupid is as stupid does; I hate to admit this but I 
thought your unit in ANK was a fleet.
Think about it.
He's been sitting there, a small u for about a year in real time and somehow
in my attention deficit ridden brain I read the map with you having a fleet
in ANK and more importantly no way to move into any of my supply centers.
I ws pretty confident that if you and Italy attacked that I could put up enough
of a fight maybe to survive.
I was actually looking forward to a little combat.
The battle now is going to be more like a cross between a skirmish and a
mop up operation.
Too bad!
To add insult to injury I suspected that stab.
That's why I duped you into moving to Greece.
I figured Italy would move IZM-EME, but then I didn't think to move to IZM
unsupported.
I didn't see it even though I saw his move coming.
I guessed wrong on Tunis.
I didn't think you'd believe Sean when he told you that I was going to Libya.
So much for reverse psychology.
Suddenly I feel very old....

<p>
(UKRAINE - BRITAIN): What to do?  Answer your mail ( &lt; :.  I hope some of
the letters have gotten through, and that you'll return to Milk and
Cookies in <i>Tinamou</i>.  I certainly understand that there are other 
priorities right now!

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN): I agree, decisions decisions and more decisions. 
We shall fight on.

<p>
(EGYPT - TURKEY): Kent, my old friend.
It was great to hear from you.
Quite frankly I've been worried about you.
I was afraid you may have taken our ``little'' stab personal.
I'm glad to see you're doing well and that you've gotten over it.

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): I bet the German loves the fact you're going to be leaving your
back door open. 
And don't count Jeff and I out just yet, including the fact
I've proved more then once to be most troublesome in this situation.

<p>
(SPAIN-FRANCE): Hey, do You, Kent and Roland want company in the eliminated
box because there some of us will be there soon.

<p>
(SPAIN-GM): The first one sets the rules, the second one bends the rules, and in the
third one all bets are off.

<p>
(BOOB to SEAN): RIIIIGHT!
Gotcha.

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): Are you going to attack Jeff and Paul or Jeff and John at the
sametime??

<p>
(EGYPT to WORLD): Italians and Ukrainians and Krauts, ``Oh my!''

<p>
(UKRAINE - BOOB): Ooeey GUI, rich and chewy, ....   name that product.

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Nice one, did you open up thinking you were with a girlfriend
instead of a room full of backstabbers or was it nice to think you had a
life??
Well, don't feel bad I don't got a life either??     

<p>
(UKRAINE - EGYPT): Like most people, when we hear someone yell Help!,
we run towards the sound.  I'll be there shortly and you can tell
me what the problem is.

<p>
(EGYPTIAN MILITARY ACADEMY TRAINING DRILL): Write on the blackboard 100 times,
a big U is a Ukrainian fleet, a small u is a Ukrainian army, a big U....

<p>
(SPAIN-THE DEPARTED): Ashes to ashes dust to dust when you see me coming let
it rust.

<p>
(SPAIN-THE POPE): Last respects, please. 

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY, UKRAINE, ITALY): You may take our home you may take our 
hope, you may take our life, but you will never take our freedom!

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Sorry, our women and children under 16 have been sent overseas 
to a remote continent called the United States that is the only nuclear 
power that can kick your beep!

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): Nice one, predictable, but a nice one all the same.

<p>
(EGYPT to STARFLEET): Mayday, Mayday.... Romulan attack army group 
disguised as a Vulcan transport fleet has invaded and overwhelmed
our forces at our forward ``intelligence'' listening post.
Ferengi forces have cut us off from our Klingon allies.... situation
desperate... request immediate assistance....

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Way to go, stosh.
Not only did you get caught with your pants down you got caught with them 
off. On the up side I couldn't have been caught with them down, I've been 
fighting wars since this game started. 
It's about time this is starting to end, 
concerning I have already lost 49% of Spain's male population.

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Nice move, didn't see it coming.
Suspected it, but didn't see 
it, but then again it's rare to see a diplomat with two rear ends.
(You all have seen <i>Aladdin</i>, the Walt Disney movie with the Genie, with 
Robin Williams as the voice).

<p>
(SPAIN-FRANCE): Well, I guess I'll be seeing you soon.

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN): Hey John, Jonas are you aware that Italy, Germany and 
Ukraine are going to try for a three way probably.

<p>
(SPAIN-SPAIN): SHUT UP!

<p>
(BOOB to SPAIN): Yes, it was a nice run, but I hope you have some more help
next time!

1) Ummmm.... yeah.  I made a small error in the supply center chart, so that
Japan has one more build and Russia has no builds.

<p>
(RUSSIA to BRITAIN): Well, okay, so your days aren't really numbered any
more than anyone else's ... heh, heh, heh, we were just kidding.  Oh,
sure, I mean we'll keep prosecutin' this little war and all, but it
ain't nothin' we should be callin' out like a Babe Ruth homerun ...

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): Did we make it two in a row?  Lawdy, Lawdy, I do
declayuh!  Ain't it a cawshun'!

<p>
(SAUGUS to PROVIDENCE): Well, then I concede that I was a complete moron
to let you talk me into playing this misbegotten piece of flat-edged
crap.

<p>
(OZOGSAN - TSAR): Aw gee, and help you win the game so
easily and end all this fun stuff? Noooo. You have to
endure this like the slow agonizing pain of the
Chinese water torture that Jim-Boob mentioned earlier. 

<p>
(TSAR to KURTUGAWA OZOGSAN): Would it make any difference to you if I told
you I'm really a woman masquerading as a man and have been doing so for
18 years and my names is really Dawn?  Would you go fall on your sword
over me or something?

<p>
(BOOB to DAWN): All hail the Rising Sun.....

<p>
(TSAR to GM (QUIET ASIDE)):  I'm hoping it's genetic ...

<p>
(BOOB to TSAR): You mean your ability to stick your foot in your mouth???
Yes, I'm positive it's genetic!!!

<p>
(TSAR to FRENCH): Got any LONG-term plans, Roland?  It's tough watching
you go bit by bit like a leper.  Just give me some kind of sign there,
guy.

<p>
(F-J): The courier has been found and the messages have been sent on their
way. Come to find out he was shacked up with a Filipino woman ALL THESE
MONTHS.

<p>
(RUSSIA to SHOW ME THE MONEY): You know, if you guys vote the concession
to me now, all this abusive verbosity could be a thing of the past ...
