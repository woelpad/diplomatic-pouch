<p><br><p><br>Ian Curtis looks down on all of us and laughs..... ``I remember..... when we were
young... not afraid any more, I keep my eyes on the door."  From ``Insight'' by.... 
who else but Joy Division.
Ian, of course, took the door by choice.
The subject of my next header most definitely did not.
Anyone who thinks talking about Ian Curtis and Douglas Adams in the same paragraph
makes no sense is defined by me to be quite mad themselves.....
join me in the ``Shadowplay''....
``I let them use you for their own ends."
The latter is my choice for the best ``Music Diplomacy" quote of all time (thanks to
Bob Olsen for originally calling my attention to it two decades ago).  Other nominees
are welcome.
Those of you who never have heard the TOTALLY distinctive voice of Ian Curtis sing
these lines are truly the poorer for it as the lines on the page don't do justice
to them.
Unfortunately, we also had a more recent suicide as well, as Susannah McCorkle
jumped off the balcony of her Manhattan apartment last weekend.
Sorry for all the morbid stuff this issue, I'll put more on Susannah down below
and close off the header with Douglas Adams.

<p>
Thanks to Mike Mazzer (mmazzer of goalonline.com)
for the choice quotes from Douglas Adams as Mike noted:
``The world is a little less funny.  Douglas Adams, author of the
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series died on May 11 of a sudden heart
attack at the age of 49.  So ...''

<p>
<p>`` `...You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to
them had you? I mean like actually telling anyone or anything.'
    
<p>
`But the plans were on display...'
    
<p>
`On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.'
    
<p>
`That's the display department.'
    
<p>
`With a torch.'
    
<p>
`Ah, well the lights had probably gone.'
    
<p>
`So had the stairs.'
    
<p>
`But look you found the notice didn't you?'
    
<p>
`Yes,' said Arthur, `yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a
locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a
sign on the door saying ``Beware of The Leopard".' "

<p>
- Arthur singing the praises of the local council planning department.

<p>
<i>((Remind anyone of Don Williams???))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.'
    
<p>
`Very deep,' said Arthur, `you should send that in to the ``Reader's
Digest". They've got a page for people like you.' "

<p>
- Ford convincing Arthur to drink three pints in ten minutes at
lunchtime.

<p>
<i>((Indeed.
We don't do enough of this any more, do we???
It must be Don Williams' fault.))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `This must be Thursday,' said Arthur to himself, sinking low over
his beer, `I never could get the hang of Thursdays.'"

<p>
- Arthur, on what was to be his last Thursday on Earth.

<p>
<i>((I don't know, I like Thursdays....))</i>

<p>
<p>``Pages one and two [of Zaphod's presidential speech] had been
salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had
already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest
which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely
of papier mache and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched
baby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond
Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but
wanted no truck with it."

<p>
- An example of Damogran wildlife.

<p>
<i>((No Duck that.... so this has NOTHING to do with Don Williams.))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `How do you feel?' he asked him.
    
<p>
`Like a military academy,' said Arthur, `bits of me keep passing out.' '' ....
    
<p>
`` `We're safe,' he said.
    
<p>
`Oh good,' said Arthur.
    
<p>
`We're in a small galley cabin,' said Ford, `in one of the
spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.'
    
<p>
`Ah,' said Arthur, `this is obviously some strange usage of the word
``safe" that I wasn't previously aware of.' ''

<p>
- Arthur after his first ever teleport ride.

<p>
<i>((Maybe that's how I could wake up Don Williams??))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger
down his throat...'  "

<p>
- The Book, on one of the Vogon's social inadequacies.

<p>
<i>((This is the all time great Douglas Adams quote.
I wonder if it works with Don Williams??))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `You'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It's
unpleasantly like being drunk.'
    
<p>
`What's so unpleasant about being drunk?'
    
<p>
`You ask a glass of water.' "
  
<p>
- Arthur getting ready for his first jump into hyperspace.

<p>
<i>((You know we care, Don.... I'm having fun and I'M not feeling
one bit unpleasant!!))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `You know,' said Arthur, `it's at times like this, when I'm trapped
in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and
about to die from asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd
listened to what my mother told me when I was young.'
    
<p>
`Why, what did she tell you?'
    
<p>
`I don't know, I didn't listen.'"

<p>
- Arthur coping with certain death as best as he could.

<p>
<i>((How come I feel that way in every Diplomacy game I play with Don Williams??))</i>

<p>
`` `Ford, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it.' "

<p>
- Arthur experiences the improbability drive at work.

<p>
<i>((This has nothing to do with Don, he is eminently probable.))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `I think you ought to know that I'm feeling very depressed.' "
    
<p>
`` `Life, don't talk to me about life.' "
    
<p>
`` `Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you
down to the bridge. Call that ``job satisfaction"? 'Cos I don't.' "
    
<p>
`` `I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side.' "

<p>
- Guess who.

<p>
<i>((No, I won't accept that about Don!!!))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it
caught and shot now.' "

<p>
- Zaphod.

<p>
<i>((And that CAN'T be Don, must be Toby or Faz....))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were
REAL men, women were REAL women, and small furry
creatures from Alpha Centauri were REAL small furry creatures from
Alpha Centauri.' "

<p>
- The Book getting all nostalgic.

<p>
<i>((Makes you long for Socrates....))</i>

<p>
<p>    `` `Hey this is terrific!' Zaphod said. `Someone down there is trying
to kill us!'
    
<p>
`Terrific,' said Arthur.
    
<p>
`But don't you see what this means?'
    
<p>
`Yes. We are going to die.'
    
<p>
`Yes, but apart from that.'
    
<p>
`APART from that?'
    
<p>
`It means we must be on to something!'
    
<p>
`How soon can we get off it?'"

<p>
- Zaphod and Arthur in a certain death situation over Magrathea.

<p>
<i>((Hee, heh, heh...))</i>

<p>
<p>``And wow! Hey! What's this thing coming towards me very fast? Very
very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big
wide sounding word like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it!
That's a good name - ground!
I wonder if it will be friends with me?"

<p>
- For the sperm whale, it wasn't.

<p>
<i>((If I were a sperm whale in Douglas Adams' world, I would learn to
fly, PDQ.))</i>

<p>
<p>``Oh no, not again."

<p>
- A bowl of petunias on it's way to certain death.

<p>
<i>((Ditto....))</i>

<p>
`` `Er, hey Earthman...'
    
<p>
`Arthur,' said Arthur.
    
<p>
`Yeah, could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard
this end of the passageway. OK?'
    
<p>
`Guard?' said Arthur. `What from? You just said there's no one here.'
    
<p>
`Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?' said Zaphod.
    
<p>
`Whose? Yours or mine?'"

<p>
- Arthur drawing the short straw on Magrathea.

<p>
<i>((This REALLY sounds like me negotiating with Don Williams.....))</i>

<p>
<p>``There are of course many problems connected with life, of which
some of the most popular are `Why are people born?'
      
<p>
`Why do they die?' `Why do they spend so much of the intervening
time wearing digital watches?' "

<p>
- The Book.

<p>
<i>((These are the ponderables....))</i>

<p>
<p>`` `Right,' said Ford, `I'm going to have a look.'

<p>
He glanced round at the others.
    
<p>
`Is no one going to say, ``No you can't possibly, let me go instead"?'
    
<p>
They all shook their heads.
    
<p>
`Oh well.'"

<p>
- Ford attempting to be heroic whilst being sieged by Shooty and Bangbang.

<p>
<i>((My favorite way to experience Douglas Adams was via the radio play.
I first heard it all the way through in the early 1980's (I'm not sure when
it was produced)
Thank you, Mike, and THANK YOU Douglas.
We know you've found 42 wherever you are.))</i>

P.S.  Go ahead and use this opportunity to send your orders in early.
I can handle the shock.  Really.
                                    
<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are ``taking over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
We have Michael Lowrey's <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a 
Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here 
as <i>Deny Everything</i>'s takes a major chunk of space in most issues. 

<p>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.meurglys.com

<p>
Help, David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently &#239;n stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter is unlikely to be starting any new games in the <i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ???</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>We're cancelling the search for Mickey Preston since Paul Kenny already
found him.
I'm looking for other people to search for, otherwise we will take a break.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com or johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm getting caught up here as I messed up last time getting these in here
(this game is running separately on E-Mail, of course).

<p>
2) That little public exchange with the Winter 1905 results was SO much fun 
that I couldn't resist reproducing it here for posterity as press....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HARRIS): Just as I suspected : Sev vacant to build on, F(BLA) still on the map, a
build due and still I managed to leave Bud &amp; Swe without getting greedy
over what was gonna be easy gains had I placed gaining a centre over a
longer-term strategy.

<p>
And yet, here's where I get upset, instead of building the desired and
desperately needed F(StPnc) to help hold the north, I have to go for F(Sev) 
instead, right ? 
<i>((Well, that's not what you built.... ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
Emeric, you disappoint me : what can I do to stop Niklas
winning when I have to defend against a 3-centre Turkey !!! Gimme a reason
why I don't just support Brian to Con right now ? Frankly I think it's a
miracle there's the retreat option to Serbia : It certainly wasn't in any
of my planning and I never dreamed Twerg would make such a *dumb* move
 &lt; grin &gt; . Seriously though Twerg, I would love to know why you took Greece
that way around - you knew I was going for Bul so you must have made an
oversight into what Emeric was gonna do about his retreat.

<p>
Brian, what can I say ? Sorry ? Well, analysis of our discussions last
season has me overlooking (or, rather, missing) your words which actually
said what you were up to - I just felt it was gonna be more of the same
``You'll notice I never actually promised to do X &amp; Y"

<p>
And the real irony of it all ? The 4 of us continue battling in the south
back and forth and back and forth and as a result of landing a corking
start against Mike, Niklas gets the obvious advantage over Mczet
thereafter.

<p>
I'm fed up with trying to arrange stuff. the logical solution from, ooh,
let me see, 3 or 4 game years back !, was to have two powers share the
south. But each time a suggestion is made the other party decides to go   
their own way .... like Brian sharing Austria/Turkey/Balkans with me by
ordering A(Ven) - Tus, or Emeric likewise by slipping the fleets around and
facing a second Russian fleet in the face and a miraculous escape from a
disband. So I gave Twerg some help/freedom/space/whatever and he goes
vacating Serbia only to give it up to Emeric. Bah, numpties the lot of yous
:-)    

<p>
(MEEF): Not much on giving complements, eh?  Toby?   

<p>
(HARRIS): ... and I forgot to mention what a splendid move combo Mike/Ray came up
with over the recapture of Kie or (if it failed) the theft of Holland.
Beautiful capture of Holland that man, three cheers for M'Huffy :-)

<p>
Sorry Mike - just gotten so darned cheesed off with this game you guys
haven't seen the normal Toby at all ! The ``normal" one is far more evil :-) 

<p>
(DENNEHY): My apologies, Toby, for not allowing you the freedom to have conquered the
Balkans and Turkey by now - and be ready to face Niclas with 14 or so
units, while I stayed on 4.

<p>
I'll know the next time, that it will obviously be in my interest to join
forces with you - especially with your very thought provoking plans - which
usually entail - you gaining lots of centres - while I/whomever, not only
doesn't gain any centres, but actually gives up position to the intended
target of such a plan.

<p>
Next time - I will go along with you 100% ... hang on a minute ... didn't Jim 
do that before ?
Oh right - and he got ... well eliminated while you soloed ...... hmmm -
makes one wonder at the wisdom of such a strategy.
<i>((Abuse of the GM will get you everywhere.... yes, Toby won, but I
took my gamble with my eyes wide shut....))</i>

<p>
Be proud Toby - for you have influenced the East, and influenced the West.
Be proud Toby - and stand for all to see at the pinnacle of power in your
Muscovite lair.
Be proud Toby - for it is truly a wonder to see a master at work - while you
consistently screw the East up and then give out to some/all of us for not
seeing your light.

<p>
Be proud Toby - and fight hard - for the day is not yet won - find a
weakness in Niclas's armour?
I doubt it - for he doesn't speak much, and therefore cannot be accused of
lying, unlike some !!
<i>((Methinks he doesn't HAVE to and knowing when to be silent is perhaps
the greatest and most difficult Diplomatic skill.))</i>

<p>
Be proud Toby - I await the next stage of the game with interest. 

<p>
(HARRIS): I am proud .... my nipples are erect :-)

<p>
(SETZER): No, no, no! How many time to I have to tell you guys!? The correct
phrase is. ``My nipples explode with delight."
           
<p>
(DENNEHY): *up ur gickerbox Tobibor*

The new Spring issue should be out shortly and is worth waiting for.
A ``wrap-up" of the 1999 WorldMasters tournament, plus some other great articles.
The previous New Year issue features a doozy of an interview
with Brandon Clarke of New Zealand.
Also, the ``Ruffians'' demo game has a write up with an introduction to the
full negotiation history on the Diplomatic Pouch's Showcase web site.
You can see how our very own Paul Rauterberg was screwed over by former
World Champion Chris Martin not once, not twice, but at least THREE times.
But Chris didn't win.... not that time.
There also are some summaries on all the different ways to play Diplomacy
in the World at the present time and some writeups on last year's major
British Diplomacy conventions.
Kath Collman's write up I found particularly gripping and illuminating reading!

Well if I recall correctly, Trevor gave you ``good" ``review"... I think
he said:

<p>
1) Postal players are insane

<p>
2) Jim-Bob is the most insane of the postal players

<p>
3) Fool would fit right in (and Trevor HAS seen me play)

<p>
4) Postal players are insane.

<p>
This will be my locale until the end of first week in June. After that I
will be moving back to DC for summer, but I will be having my mail
forwarded. 

<p>
Also, will you be putting up a map of the game on the web (in <i>TAP</i>, do
you do this)?  If not, I might be able to do that myself after the
orders come out. I can probably find some webspace somewhere, either in
my tripod account or on gem to do it, if I could get a good map (have to
fool around w/ mapit).

<i>((Yes, heh, heh, heh.
I don't put maps up on the web page but I actually HAND DRAW them (yes,
I still do that) and put them in the postal version of the szine.
Damned inconvenient, isn't it ;-)
If you want to make maps for this game when it starts, the easiest thing
to do would be to put them with the szine at the DipPouch.
That might be fun to see how that goes.
Meef does maps for the WorldMasters Boasters game up above and they go on
the WorldMasters 2000 web page.
True confesssions here.... I use the hand drawn maps as the final GM check
of the results, which I generally do in my head.
And I can't imagine anything faster than me scribbling out the results on
the map by hand.
If I entered all the orders into an adjudicator, that would take longer
and then I might as well not do the adjudication by hand.
Call me Luddite, but.... ;-)  
This next one got lost and should have been in the last issue, but
I thought I would offer a mea culpa and hope all at DixieCon are
doing well this weekend.))</i>

<b>Don Del Grande (Sat, 05 May 2001 17:09:35 -0700)</b>

<p>
<i>((Don responded to my: ``I ended up holding this until the ``end'' 
of Survivor...
Survivor ends in a win for Tina...I am not totally pleased about (it) because,
in a Diplomacy game, Colby should have won.''))</i>

<p>
Perhaps, but Survivor differs from Diplomacy in another way as well; a 
number of the immunity challenges don't deal with being 
diplomatic.  Imagine if, at the end of each game year, they play a game of, 
say, History of The World or Civilization and the winner was immune from 
being ``voted off the board", as it were.

<p>
Besides, it's not just Survivor, it's ``meta-Survivor"; it's time to see who 
gets the celebrity status now.  How well you do in the game itself is not 
particularly relevant - seen Kelly Wiglesworth lately (and if you just 
said ``who", you've pretty much proven my point; she finished second to 
Richard Hatch in the first series) - especially if you're measuring it from 
a cash standpoint.
<i>((Oh, I'll never forget Wiglesworth - I corrected your spelling of
her name ;-) - but you're absolutely right.
And to the extent it gets less Diplomacy and more ``Celebrity" I get less
and less interested.
This time I agree that Colby will get WAY more attention than Tina does
even though she ``won''.))</i>

<p>
(And nobody seems to remember that the answer to ``What is Tina going to do 
with the money" is ``first, send at least $300,000 of it to the 
IRS".  Speaking of money, am I the only person who's noticed that they say 
what you get for first ($1,000,000) and second ($100,000), but after that 
they never mention numbers other than ``at least $2500"?
<i>((No, but at one point Rudy told people that he got $80,000 for third place.

Jim-Bob,
I disagree with your comment that Colby would have won had it been a
Diplomacy game.  He did the Survivor equivalent of all the right military
moves, but he chose his opponent incorrectly at the end, and all the little
guys he'd trampled on threw it to Tina.  I think Tina sneaks in to 18 SCs
while Colby holds at 14.  You can't win either without making enemies, but
you can't win either without friends either.

<p>
But Survivor doesn't appear to have the same goals as Diplomacy.  A second
is as good as a win, since you might just get more in endorsements/TV
appearances/Movie deals any way.  So Carebearing someone else into a solo is
almost tolerable.

Jim, always read the political letters and offer perhaps an `outside'
perspective on a few things.
I, for one, was cheering for George W in your election. I believe that the
Clintons (both of them) were a disgrace. To date the first 120+ days of the
presidential term has restored a degree of respectability back to the
`office of the president'. In regards to the `space defense' approach. If
the Russians and Chinese are that much against it. Then all the reason to
keep on developing the system. The cold war has never really ended.

<i>((That is, of course, an important perspective.
I don't really think the Russians matter on this issue anywhere near as much
as the Chinese.
I certainly agree with you that the Cold War from THAT perspective was pretty
hot even before recent events.
I think the question to ponder is whether or not the Chinese will end up
being THE Superpower of the 21st Century just as we became the Superpower
of the 20th.
I think it likely.))</i>

Jim,
As a die hard Joy Division/New Order fan, I'm anxiously awaiting the 
new album by New Order due out this fall. I've been killing time until 
its release by listening to the two new live albums released this year 
by Joy Division - both are intense and excellent - and by listening to 
bootlegs of two tracks (``Crystal" and ``60 mph") from the unreleased new
album.  I was commenting to a friend today that JD only ever released 
two ``real" albums in their all too brief career, but there are now nine
albums on the market.  It makes me feel a little foolish to have bought
them all, but I enjoy every one (OK, maybe with the exception of 
<i>Permanent</i>). I'm upset that they are touring as part of the Moby 
festival this summer, but are only appearing on the West Coast.  I'm 
considering using some frequent flyer miles to see them in Vancouver and
Seattle on back to back nights in August, but can't find anyone to join
me, yet.  If they were playing at indoor venues I would go myself, but 
long outdoors ``festivals" aren't much fun by yourself.

<p>
<i>((I'm actually glad to hear about the
Joy Division live albums.  I haven't purchased either one, but
have been ``eyeing" them for some time.  Is there one of them
in particular that you would recommend over the other??
The French one <i>Les Bains Douches</i> looks to be the one to
get on the surface.))</i>

<p>
The JD live albums are very different.  The French one definitely has the
better sounding music and is much more in line with a ``typical" live album -
it is similar to the live tracks on <i>Still</i> and it is longer than <i>Presten</i>.
However, <i>Presten</i> is intense and different than any other live album I have
ever heard.  Their equipment is falling apart all around them during the gig
and they keep trying to keep it together.  It is definitely raw and ragged
and needs to be listened to loud.  If you have the other studio JD albums, I
would go with <i>Presten</i> for its unique experience, but you can't go wrong with
either one.

Quite frankly it blew my totally away.
I had forgotten how long it had been since I've been listening to Joy Division,
which always has been one of my favorite bands.
The music gripped me again and wouldn't let go.
Ian Curtis' voice demands to be listened to, not glossed over as background.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I don't even know why I hesitated to buy this when I first saw it.
Each and every song a masterpiece of depth and vision.

<i>((Yes, indeed.
The things she could do with songs NO ONE else could approach.
What I found most amazing was her uncanny ability to take a song that
was not just associated but MARRIED to another great singer and 
do a new version that made you realize that you'd never heard the
song before (at least not REALLY heard it).
My favorite example of this is what she did with ``There's No Business
Like Show Business".
Admit it, all of you have Ethel Merman in your heads!
Go listen to Susannah McCorkle do it and you'll realize that you never
REALLY knew what the song was about and you'll eschew the bombast of
Ms. Merman as WAY over the top from then on.
On the contrary, it was Susannah who really knew how to marry a song.
I just wish she had known how to live and get beyond her depression as well.))</i>

<i>Along Came a Spider - TAP response</i>

<p>
What an AWFUL movie!

<p>
Well, I should qualify it.  The first 3/4 of the movie was terrific.
Then it had to have the utterly stupid ``twist".   I guess this is supposed
to be ``clever", but it's EXACTLY THE SAME TWIST that was in <i>Kiss the Girls</i>.
(Well, not ``exactly", but very similar.)  

<p>
The ``twist" in <i>Kiss the Girls</i> managed to nearly ruin that movie.  Would have,
too, had it not been for the lovely Ashley Judd.  She's not in <i>Spider</i>.
<i>((I haven't seen that movie, but I should.
I find Ashley Judd amazing at making a mediocre movie from a plot standpoint,
riveting from a watchability standpoint.))</i>

<p>
Somebody has to tell this author that pulling a character out of the woodwork
and making him the ``real villain" is simply bad writing.  I think the primary
villain in ``Spider" was very interesting - clearly there was supposed to
be some background story involving Michael Moriarty.  I was half-expecting
some neat kind of ``Chinatown" ending.  (``My sister! My daughter!  My sister!
My daughter!  Has there <i>ever</i> been a better detective movie than Chinatown?
Of course not!)  Had the movie simply done a normal development from there,
the ending could have been quite interesting.  

<p>
But really, if Patterson had tried to pull this kind of misdirection in any
half-decent writing class, the teacher would have ridiculed him mercilessly.

<p>
Trying to remember the other movie I saw recently.  Right - the <i>Dundee III</i>
film.  Similar to the first two, but I think its time has passed.  Nice, 
light-hearted comedy/adventure stuff.  The Dundee movies do a very good job
at capturing American life from a different perspective.  I think they are
underrated in that respect.  Sure, there's always some unrealistic adventure 
happening (drug lords before, smugglers in this movie) but the simple things
are pretty cool.  

<p>
Oh, and I finally saw <i>Fight Club</i>.  That's really a film that has a lot to
say.  I have to mull it over a bit and see it again.  ``His name was
Robert Paulsen!"

<p>
<i>((Yeah, <b>Fight Club</b> has been on my ``to rent" list for some time.
I know I need to rent it when I will really be able to pay attention to it.
Let me VERY carefully also pull from a bit more of Rick's follow up conversation
with me.  We're trying not to give this movie away or others 
to anyone who hasn't seen them and might.
But read ahead with care.....))</i>

<p>
And it's not like I dislike big twists - but they really have to be well-done.
<i>The Usual Suspects</i> was the best movie of its genre in the 90s, and it pulled
off the twist masterfully, but that was due largely to Kevin Spacey.  (We're
past the point where we have to worry about giving that away, aren't we?  I 
mean, the guy won an Oscar for this role!)  <i>Presumed Innocent</i> also had
a great twist at the end (and entirely too realistic for those of us who
were grad students in mathematics for years and years!)  

<p>
<i>((I think this is the kind of movie that you like OK or hate (not
quite love or hate).  Charlotte and I kind of liked it.  Not 
wonderful or brilliant, but we liked it.  The writing was there
so you could ``see why the person did it", at least a little bit.))</i>

<p>
I just didn't buy it.  It seemed too Scoobyish to me.  There was nothing
in how the character was drawn to really suggest that these things were
in the character's nature.

<i>The Mummy Returns</i> ... a movie

<p>
As you have all heard here and there the secret to making a good sequel is to 
make the same movie all over again, but bigger.  <i>The Mummy Returns</i> is all 
that.

<p>
This time Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) lost love Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia 
Velazquez) is intent of bringing him back from the dead not out of love but 
because he is the only one strong enough to kill The Scorpion King (WWF's 
`The Rock') and thus wrest from him the army of Anubis, with which to rule 
the world.

<p>
Meanwhile Evie O'Connell (Rachel Weisz) becomes aware that she is the 
reincarnation of Nefitiri, the ancient Pharaoh's daughter.  It was her sacred 
duty to protect the amulet which can bring the evil Scorpion King back to 
life.  That is a prerequiste for killing him.

<p>
Alex (Freddie Boath) Evie's son with Rick (Brendon Fraser) gets right in the 
middle by putting on the amulet arm band and suddenly becoming the key.  He 
is most charming and very much a cross between the smartest kid in the world 
and Dennis the Menace.  He has one of the best lines in the movie, delivered 
just after the temple that he and his parents have been exploring self 
destructs around them.

<p>
Said parents have just washed up at his feet when the wall that he has 
accidently destroyed releases them from a deadly water trap.  ``Mom, Dad, I 
can explain everything."

<p>
Brendon Fraser reprises his earlier Rick O'Connell, the reluctant hero.  
Comic Action seems better suited to him than straight comedy.  He was good.

<p>
Great action, wonderful computer graphics.  Lots of fun to watch.

<p>
The Rock got a really short shrift.  He is being billed as jointly starring 
in the flick, but he only has a couple minutes of screen time at the beginning 
of the movie, and shows up for the last few minutes as a computer graphic.  
And if that wasn't enough, the credits reveal that his real name is Dwayne.

<i>A Knight's Tale</i> ... a movie

<p>
Heath Ledger goes from young colonial hero to medieval hero and manages to 
bring the same sort of half confused (about women) terribly brave persona 
along with him. 

<p>
He plays William Thatcher born a freeman although called a peasant who 
aspires to knighthood.  Of course his picture of knighthood has to do with 
fighting in tournaments.  He wants to be a pro athlete actually.  He picks up 
the armor of the man who died following that very profession, tournament 
contestant, and turns himself into Ulriech von Lichtensein of MTVland.

<p>
You have your medieval knight and your rock-on media personality.

<p>
I feel terribly ambivalent about the whole thing.  It shouldn't have been any 
good at all.  Some of the writing was really cheesy.  The fact that it was 
cheesy on purpose possibly counts for something.  Tough call.  But despite 
all of the silliness, the thin plot, the unmotivated actions of the boy and 
girl, it still was over very fast.

<p>
That's usually the sign that a movie was good.  I'm still not sure that this 
one was.

Well, since Derek Anderson is out, and the Lakers are so HOT, I'm a bit
worried about my Spurs prediction.  But I'm not going to wimp out now (esp.
not when the Lakers are involved) so I'll stick with it.  (I just want
to express worry so you don't think I'm dim.)
<i>((And that one has been swept.... all over in four.
They might just sweep through the whole playoffs.
Philadelphia or Milwaukee don't seem to be on the Lakers' level at all.))</i>

<p>
More baseball: let's see how Cone holds up this week.  That's a big key.
The Sox need more pitching.  (Why do they have so much trouble developing
prospects?  I worry they're giving Okha and Crawford the same kind of
treatment which Sele hated when he was here.  Sele turned into a top-flight
starter the day he left Boston.  That still bugs me.)  The Sox
need more dependability from their #2 and #3 starters.  Nomo needs to stop
walking so many people.  (What happened to his big new strike zone?)
<i>((He did and LOOK at that masterful one hitter!!))</i>

<p>
My worry right now is that the AL East will not get the wildcard.  Seattle
looks like a weak lock for the AL West already, and the Twins and Indians
could conceivably both get into the playoffs.  Certainly one of these two
teams would have to fall off before an AL East team won the wildcard.
  
<p>
<i>((That's certainly the way it all looks, though Oakland is white-hot
and may get back into the Division or Wild Card race.
Clearly, Toronto doesn't have the pitching, so it really is just six clubs
(Oak, Sea, Min, Cle, NY, and Bos) fighting for four spots.
The NL is MUCH more open.
I don't think ANYONE is completely out of it, not even the Mets!
And look at the West!!! 
That's just insane how close all those teams are.))</i>

<p>
The problem with the unbalanced schedule is that the Yankees, Red Sox, and
Blue Jays could all end up killing each other, while the contenders in the
other divisions have comparatively few tough games.  The key here is to try
to pull away from the Jays.  Gotta figure the Yanks will stick around, but
the Jays pitching is a bit suspect, and if that starts to fall apart, that 
would help.  
<i>((See above...))</i>

<p>
Manny is just phenomenal to watch.  In Rick's fantasy world, Manny keeps it
up, Nomar comes back strong, and next year the Sox sign Jason Giambi to have
a 3-6 of Nomar/Manny/Giambi/Everett which rivals any I've ever seen.
I really wish they had a solid #2 starter though.

Ian Moore is right that there is antipathy towards dubya in the Bay

radio address and that he works only modestly hard.  However, his reversal
of numerous regulations and policies that will worsen the environment, do
not address repetitive motion injuries, rewards large business, hinders
population control and numerous other policies and actions that alter
acceptance of diversity keeps him an object of scorn.
<i>((His schizophrenic attitude toward diversity, both here and abroad,

There is no pride in inheriting a name or being the recipient of being a
family member in America.  What did YOU do?  And recently?  And, in Dubya's
sake, his management style allows many of the very conservative folk who ran
the bureaucracy/military-industrial complex for the past few decades to
regain control and to resume the policies that were never appreciated by the
typical Bay Area pc-liberal.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
I've decided to kill the Star Trek Diplomacy opening.  
It clearly wasn't resonating.
I think I'll try again when Colonia ends.
Sorry about that everyone.
I owe Chris Trent $20 back, but according to my records I don't 
have money from anyone else.
If you think that is incorrect, let me know.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED game.
The Breaking Away game is starting below, get me names, riders and cards!!!

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at:

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Lots of proposals this time.
Let's go over for the record how we do it around here.
If you don't vote on a proposal, it cannot pass, you need unanimous active support
for a proposal to pass.
The votes are tallied in the next season (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer), in this
case Spring.
Please vote and we'll see what happens. 
And here they are....

<p>
- The GT sportsters special.... fast and tight in the corners, vote for this
one and get on the highway fast, no hesitation!!!
 
<p>
- The GRIE draw is either a funny cheese or one Frenchman shy of Charlie Brown!
Vote for this one only if you appreciate an ending that isn't quite anything.

<p>
- The GET draw is simple and straightforward.  Get it if you got it.

<p>
- The EGRT draw is missing some doubling up.  My preference would be to
include Russia and England TWICE (after all, haven't they worked twice as
hard???) and vote for this one with no regret!!

<p>
- The ET draw seems to be missing the French too, and..... well, what else?
Seems a bit witchy to me, but vote for it if you like.

<p>
- And last but not least, the TIGER draw includes the one and only Toadfather
in the fiercest outcome imaginable.
Slashing and clawing, vote for this one with a flourish, if you dare.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WARSAW): The Tzar had dispatched his best back beaters to England and Germany 
to dispense a few lashes on his known lackeys.  They report the spilling 
of a bit of blood.  Sticking his cigar back into his throat [heck, that 
never leaves his mouth!], the Tsar [brother of the Tzar] walked over the 
window in his dungeon and remarked, ``Heck, we finally got that traveling 
Pope to move!", noting that the statement would infuriate the Aussies 
and the Turkeys.  ``Gee, they were so bent on assassination!  We sure 
fooled those fools, huh!"

<p>
(SHREEVIES' BAR [Russian Liver Flukes and Ascaris Press]):
Everyone was wondering where the scratching sound was coming from.  
Then, someone noticed that Bernie was trying to claw and scratch his way 
out of a spit-toon that had dried.  Wanted oh so much to keep Bernie 
where he belongs, a feat heretofore not achieved, each bar-fly walked 
within 30 feet of the spit-toon and spat into the opening.  Covered with 
gooooooo, Bernie finally and once more slid down [errrrrrr, back down] 
into the spit-urinal-toon.  A loud burp of air was heard breaking 
through the top layer as the bubble burst and the ``wind" waifed into the 
bar-room of bar-flies.  In a last ditch effort to flee from his brass
captor, Bernie shouted to the Bar-Fly's ego and macho that he would bet 
none of those, errrrrr, guys, could put his fist through the opening, 
and shove that fist all the way to the bottle of Bernie's barrel, and 
squash poor Bernie!  When the first fist came down, Bjarne [errrrrrr, 
Bernie] grabbed a bent finger an was finally pulled to safety.  Luckily, 
Bernie landed in a glass of beer and was washed, as it were, of his 
``Sins".  where to from here!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Wow, that wasn't too hard... I think I have everything right, but you might
want to check retreat options carefully, especially Austria's from the South
Pacific.

<p>
2) Bob Acheson informs me that he will be out of action for the first week in
June with some surgery.
We wish him all the best for a speedy recovery and we note that China has no
summer retreats, so he owes me nothing for the upcoming deadline.
I think I just need retreats from two of you, and Robert Stimmel should
note that my default will be to retreat to Bengal, since there is only
one on-the-board option.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) For the record, there was an error in the results last time.
The French ACTUALLY ordered <i>a BOH S AUSTRIAN a gal-vie</i> (nso).
The Austrian did not so order, so it made no difference in the
final unit locations, but I did want to publically record the order.
Sorry about that....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY to AUSTRIA):  Hey, Kent, you wanna reassess the source of the 
danger here?  You might want to keep in mind that I have kept every 
promise I have made to you, ever since I took over this position.
<i>((Hmmmm, it seems not only France has been ``keeping promises''
to you....))</i>

<p>
(ROME to PARIS): Don't waste your electrons on me, boy.  From now on, I 
have to assume that everything you tell me is just another lie.  I think 
I'd be better off buying a watch than asking you the time.
<i>((Never mind....))</i>

<p>
(STEVE to JIM-BOB): Okay, so the Senators fell ever-so-slightly short of 
reaching the Stanley Cup finals.  At least my pick for the championship, 
St. Louis, is still alive at this writing.  I see you have three out of 
four semifinalists.  Have you considered another career as a hockey 
analyst?  And do you also predict lottery numbers?
<i>((No, I don't do lotteries....
and I now am 2-2 for the finalists (of course, this shouldn't be seen
as having been that difficult, since Colorado and New Jersey were the
respective #1 seeds, but it hasn't happened in recent memory.
I am solidly behind Colorado to win it.  
Let it ride.....))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The RAG draw proposal fails.  
We have some new ideas for your consideration.
We have a proposal for a concession to Germany.... just admit that Goz is ghod and the
game is over.
Or, if you are more wimpy, go for an GREAF and give me some ``grief".
Actually, I'll propose a GRIEF too!!   
Why not let Paul into the draw and keep Kurt out???
Oh, yes, and the RAG is reproposed for those who wish to just RAG on me.
Vote for any or all of these with your Summer orders.
If you don't vote, you automatically veto them all and give me REAL grief.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to AUSTRIA/RUSSIA): I'll hold on as long as I can, but you 
better get ready to see German fleets in the Med.

<p>
(SWITZERLAND to ENGLAND): So are Austria and Russia cutting you out of your
part of the line?

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): If you will join with me against Germany, I will 
give you all of his home centers and Sweden and I will just take the low 
countries and Norway.  Everyone knows that Germany can't hold out long 
against a determined E/F alliance!

<p>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA): I don't vote anyone into a draw who isn't writing me.
Diplome me into believing you belong here.
             
<p>
(RUSSIA to GERMANY): Goz, you got it wrong. I don't particularly give a 
damn if they start paying 
second string bat boys a million a year or if they all go the way of ECW (the 
only sporting promotion that was truly worth a damn), bankrupt. Much better 
to participate, no matter how badly, then to watch a bunch of others play. I 
would actually be kind of happy if every pro team left Chicago, though it 
really doesn't matter. The only thing that bothers me is the corporate execs 
who take a tax deduction for going for going to things the average man can no 
longer afford.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) Remember that your A rider gets three or four cards to a total of 30, 
your B rider gets three cards to a total of 25, your C rider gets three 
cards to a total of 20, and your D rider gets three cards to a total of 16.

<p>
3) John Schultz is waiting in the wings as he wanted to ride, but didn't
make it in time.
He is welcome to send me cards and if any of you don't get them to me 
by the next deadline, I will slip him in!
So hurry up!!

<p>
4) We have one more note from Tom on the last game...

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Tom Howell (Thu, 03 May 2001 21:34:34 -0700)</b>

<p>
Jim,
I like the game so much, ... I shouldn't do it, ... but sign me up for
the next one anyway.

<p>
For Eric:
Well, I'm not gonna tell you everything I know.   However, I must say I
had my share of luck in this one.  
As far as strategy goes, I just tried to make sure no one got more
points than I did.  :)

<p>
Actually, at the first sprint line, I was seriously considering holding
back to retain some high cards, but when the opportunity presented
itself, I couldn't hold back...  :(  This is where the luck came in: I
ended up with adequate cards anyway...

<p>
I also tried to predict how the other riders would move and moved mine
in the hopes of getting good replacement cards.  Towards the end, I
mostly gave up on the players I hadn't been able to predict very well. 
I will say, and Jim should be able to vouch for this - if he remembers
some of my comments to the GM, that I find playing Breaking Away! face
to face a bit easier.  In face to face, each rider moves in sequence. 
Therefore, at least on some turns, I know where some of the opposing
riders will (have) move(d) to when it's time to move mine.  In postal
play, every move is blind.  It gets kinda tense some turns...
<i>((Yes, but as both a player and a GM, I find that part of the charm.
I'm doing pretty well in the game Dave Partridge is running.))</i>

<p>
As for agreements, I think I played this game straight.  ALICE on the
starting line, there's the finish, and first one there wins-shut up and
pedal!  (Well, ... press doesn't count, does it?)  In the second postal
game I played, I did engage in some conniving, and I think I'm in worse
shape than I ever was in MA.

<p>
I haven't played very many games of Breaking Away!, although I do enjoy
it and have done fairly well in all the games I've finished.  Thanks to
Jim for running the game.  I think I'll take another shot at the next
game.  Luck to us all!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.

<p>
3) A concession to the Ukraine is proposed.
Please vote with your Winter orders.
Failure to vote vetoes the concession.
Thank you for your time.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``I can never recognize what is in front
of me anymore, see anything for what it is, smeared with the murky film
of flayed defenses.
So easy to be wise after the event, even easier to be present and stupid.
Take it on the chin, the School of Hard Knocks.
The day spent keeping my head down, greeting people with a sickly smile....
and Heracles cried, at the first light of dawn.''
Background and Chorus from ``Myth'' off of the stellar 
<i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>.

<p>
(SPAIN-GM): That's just the thing I been trying, but my men can't find you 
anywhere in Spanish territory. Are you a Spy?? Or just so bump dumb that 
you make it out of our search teams??
<i>((Huh???))</i>

<p>
(DAVE - SEAN/JIM):  Well, I'd be happy to host that game in
Tinamou.  Kent, you want a seat?  Anyone else?
<i>((Sorry, I have to cut down, until a few games that I'm in end,
I'm on the sidelines.))</i>

<p>
(UNCLE JEFFY-POOH to SEAN): Let me get this straight, you don't have
time to play me and I live 10 minutes away, but you have time to
play Jim and he lives on the East Coast?
``I feel so inadequate!''

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): Looks like Germany and Italy wish to toss you the game, well 
that would end the game faster wouldn't it. Or did they suddenly realize 
there is no way we aren't stopping our thrusts.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY/ITALY): It's something about I was winning and now losing does 
this play any part in why you just want to throw in the game. Or did you get 
stabbed so hard that you guys have yet to recover your senses?

<p>
(THE REICH to THE UNTERMENSCH): What is the point to your existence?

<p>
(KLINGON AMBASSADOR-CAPTAIN KIRK): I do apologize for the shuttlecraft, but 
since the intersteller breaks wouldn't even break I decided to loan the 
shuttlecraft to the Ferengi when they tried to make a sneak attack onto the 
Romulans near the worm whole which is at the current time close to Earth. I 
leased the care to them for 20,000 dollars with a few modifications in the 
shuttlecraft, but I do apologize for the shuttlecraft, but I find it a bit 
ironic when the Federation shot at their own vehicle even though it was a 
hunk of junk. Not even Worf could help fix it before the Federation forced 
the Shuttlecraft off its course after phasering the shuttlecraft into the 
hyperdrive engine and its stellar battery which caused its inevitable crash 
into a asteroid belt. All that I can say is in my defense is it aided the 
assault on the Ferengi starbase. I still as of yet to distinguish why the 
Ferengi leased the shuttlecraft from the us, but I do apologize and spoken 
like a true Ferengi at least I made 20,000 dollars out of a 2,700 dollar 
piece of equipment and besides it hampered Ferengi advances around the 
wormhole.

<p>
(UNCLE JEFFY-POOH to SEAN II): Your writing has improved 
<i>((I agree, I've noticed it too.))</i> but to be honest,
I still don't understand 90% of what you write about.
The question is, ``if you were to write short story ripoffs about
my Star Trek press, would I understand it well enough to even notice?''

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG, UKRAINE): Let's see, light saber?  Nope.  Blaster?  Nope?
Cosmic Ray gun?  Nope.  Dang, what is it we use in this universe?  Oh
yeah, set feezers?, pleasers?, tasers?, on shun?, oh to hang with it, 
just chuck the holy hand grenade and lets get this ball rolling.

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Yeah I wouldn't have a chance, but unfortunatly I've made my 
bed you don't sleep in it anymore. I've seen one James Bond film too many.

<p>
(UKRAINE - ITALY):  IIInnncomingggg!!!!!!!!!!!!

<p>
(GERMANY-ITALY): Why should I help you when you can't even help yourself?

<p>
(UKRAINE-GERMANY): Soon you'll be mine.

<p>
(GERMANY-SPAIN): I'll get you for this.

<p>
(SPANISH PRESS): The Spanish press has been quieted becuase of the coming 
fall. We shall await and triumph.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG ``WHATEVER!''): Lt. Uhura has intercepted another transmission
from the ``Sultan'', complaining that his previous transmissions were phony
and did not come from him or anyone from Kragon.
Commander Data has analyzed the new ``Sultan'' transmission and has determined
that it also could not have come from the Sultan.
According to Data, ``it is plausible that the Sultan could have found a way
to communicate in plain English using a universal translator but, the poor
sentence structure, lousy grammar and misuse of punctuation could have
only originated from the Klingon ambassador for the purpose of
interstellar propaganda.
Future communiques sent from the `Sultan' on open comm channels should
probably be ignored.''

<p>
(CRAYZIE BONE QUOTE): If you did not come for war what the f*** you come here 
for?

<p>
(DMX QUOTE OF THE MONTH): If your gonna cut a ***** it might as well be his 
head.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): No hard feelings about the stab right?

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY/GERMANY): You do realize regardless this is just a game, not real 
armies and fleets. Though I think Jonas Johnson never could make that 
distinction. Though I have thought about telling him to watch the news to 
see what his forces did.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to SEAN): I assure you, they know the difference between a game
and real life very, very well.

<p>
(GERMANY-FRANCE): Maybe I should have risked a strong French government 
instead of dealing with that idiot in Spain.

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN/UKRAINE/EGYPT): Let's take 'em.

<p>
(JEFF to HARRY): I have a theory as to why you don't put in any more press.
For eight years your enviro``mental'' buddies led by Commander And Thief
Bill Clinton have passed so many Federal regulations on energy exploration
and production that in California it would take an act of God to build a
new power plant.
You can't use the Internet when the power is off and it's really hard to write in
the dark.
Al Gore has a lot of time on his hands.
Maybe he could improve communications in California by re-organizing the 
``Pony Express''.

<p>
(SPANISH NATIONAL TRIBUNE APRIL 16, 2005): Special STARS teams have been 
routed to police the streets in Madrid as the death toll from the unmarked 
killings of civilian people increase by the day. With more STARS units in 
the area only time will explain the unknown phenomenon.

<p>
(JEFF to HARRY): PS All kidding aside, I miss ya!

<p>
(JIM-BOB to JEFF): I will note for the record that the ``energy powers that be''
in California did not WANT to build new power plants.  
They wanted to use the half-assed regulatory rules (neither regulating nor
allowing the California power market to be competitive, but some impossible
``in-between'' model) to earn as more profit and new power plants would have
jeopardized that. 
Of course, they did ``miscalculate'', they intended higher profits but not
the blackouts - this just argues for going fully one way or the other more.
Probably ACTUALLY allowing market forces to fully work would have been better,
but now that they screwed it up, they might have to re-regulate all that.
And all of this did not have anything to do with Mr. Clinton.
Again, just for the record.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): I might be going on line.
Can you suggest a carrier.
<i>((I'm not really in a position or experienced with your situation to do so.
I will say that my general opinion is that local carriers are best, rather than
going with the big national and multi-national services.
But I know nothing about your local carriers.))</i>

<p>
(1995 PROLOGUE): The leaders of the super powers on the modern century met in 
Swi to discuss the tensions and come to a peaceful solution, but tensions 
only mounted instead. Forcing the 10 powers on the board to form alliances 
and decide how to proceed.

<p>
(1996-2005): The patterned result of the alliance that never stops shifting has 
come to pass the occupations of Turkey, France, Russia, and Poland by 
Britain, Germany, and Ukraine. Throughout it all Egypt had portions in 
Turkey that were soon overrun by Italian and Ukrainian forces while Spain 
has been in constant fighting the entire war and not gaining much ground 
beyond its own borders. As Paul of Germany and Eric of Italy band together 
against the 4 manned alliance of Jeff of Egypt, John of Britain, Dave of 
Ukraine, and Sean of Spain rush forward in hopes of expanding their borders 
more or to expand.
Chapter 1 next issue..

<p>
(SEAN-JIM-BOB): Is it just me or is everyone out against me? I feel that 
it's just them that's after me.
<i>((You'll have to figure that out on your own.))</i>

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLE``MENTAL''): Lt. Uhura has intercepted another transmission.
The Cardassians have attempted to contact and recruit ``Q'' into intervening
and to help expedite a possible break-up of the Federation/Klingon alliance.
<i>((By the way, I resent that implication..... I clearly have stayed quite
neutral and will continue to remain so.))</i>
Uhura says that ``Q'' has responded by suggesting the Cardassians adopt a new
National Anthem.
<i>((Uh, huh....))</i>
It goes something like this; ``it's my party, and I'll cry if I want to,
cry if I want to, cry if I want to...''
The Cardassians have not yet initiated any communications with Federation
on this issue, so I have to accept the possibility that the transmission 
was a hoax.

<p>
(SEAN-JIM PART 2): Well, since I can't find you to slit your throat I've been 
wondering how have you escaped capture from my security forces so that you 
can face your death in pain and on your knees??
<i>((I have my ways....))</i>

<p>
(JIM-BOB ON END OF VOYAGER): As most of you know, I was a faithful Star 
Trek watcher for years through all the series, but around the time that
Seven of Nine joined Voyager (and by the way, is it just me, but Jeri
Ryan is NOT especially attractive!  I prefer ALL of the other Star Trek
women over the years to her, including the other ones on Voyager) 
I totally lost interest.
The uber-plot stunk and so did the plots themselves.
Anyway, I watched the last 45 minutes or so of the final episode (since
the Red Sox were losing....) and wasn't expecting much, but....
it managed not to even hit those lowered expectations.
It totally STUNK!!
The final couple of scenes were especially terrible!!
And the final shot was the worst of all!!
Man, good riddance, good riddance, good riddance.
I will weakly look forward to the ``return to the Roots'' of Star Trek: Enterprise,
with the Enterprise before the Original Series one, set about 100 years before
Kirk and Spock.
It will have a female Vulcan first officer, I understand.
Scott Bakula is taking lots of flack as the actor choice for the Captain,
but I think he has a chance of being pretty good.
I bet they will take FULL advantage of the opportunity to back off on all of
the techno-babble that seemed to drag down Voyager especially.

<p>
(SEAN-PAUL/ERIC): Well, if you do decide to hand over your centers to Dave. Why 
do you think I even care? 
It's a game and this alliance eliminates the threat 
of Italy making another stab in the future and sorry Paul, but you blocked 
me in and I can't have that.
