<p><br><p><br>``Haltingly connected, happy commodity; The glory of shopping and fucking;

<p>
This great freedom, good fortune to work and play, I think it's the end of
the century.''

<p>
The beginning lyrics of ``Do I Know You?'' from <i>Retreat from Memphis</i>.
No, this probably isn't a szine for children, but at least I haven't gotten
into quoting from <i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i> where the Rock and Roll
band that blows Sonic Youth away teams up with Kathy Acker, yet.
But I will, I will.... anyway, yes, you get a twofer Mekons quote this issue.  

<p>
I could get used to this...
And that reminds me of the sublime Mark Cutler song of that name.
Mark is one of the house faves around here.
His latest album is out on Potters Field Records (check out Mark's web
page at http://www.mcutler.com), <i>Skylolo</i> and ``I Could Get Used To
This" is an old song that he's recorded before (I think... can't recall
when right now), but this version turns around the usual defiant bravery
he previously exhibited 
of having ``no one to hold, no one to touch, no one to kiss'' back to
poignant questioning.
Mark and I are the same age, so recording it that way at 40 has clear meaning.
Another deep record that probably won't be noticed any more than the last one....
I'm going to have to listen to it a lot more before I come to a conclusive
opinion about whether it is a damned fine recording, or merely an
inspired failure.
Either way, you are encouraged to check it out.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Consider this the first issue back from the ``two issue'' lull following the
big issue.
It still doesn't have half the stuff on my writing plate in here, but you'd
never want that plate to be empty.
As you probably can tell, I've made an effort to make Page 1 a ``reading'' page.
A little bit rock and roll first, then a little bit you and me and Diplomacy...

<p>
First, the bad news.
I'm going to have to miss World DipCon.
I'm not going to dwell on it, as most of you know, the problem with Cons in
general for me is that I travel a lot for my job, so I'm away from home
quite a bit.
And unlike most business travelers, I can't earn frequent flyer miles
so I always have to pay full fare for personal travel.
It gets tough for me as well as my wife to schedule Con trips with all that.
I also have responsibilities at my church on Sundays that fairly require
I give lots of notice before disappearing.
What made it worse this time was that I had the wrong date for World DipCon
in my head and plans.
One of you COULD have told me when you noticed it....
all things considered, I blew my big wad with the issue #200, now I have
to find a way to make one of Brad Wilson's cons this year.
Could we have details please, Brad?

<p>
While we're speaking about World DipCon, I'd like to comment on what has
been the big Con news in Britain this year - the various events surrounding
MasterCon.
Two big issues have exploded into angry discussions of varying 
severity: use of bribes in Diplomacy tournaments and use of NFP letter material.
I've seen some discussion in different places, but I am going to trust most
of my facts on Stephen Agar's accounts and the accounts of others in his 
szine <i>Spring Offensive</i>.
Apart from the fact that they have the ring of truth, I am not going to focus
at all on the personalities themselves but on the issues.

<p>
First, the basic facts of one of the key games at MasterCon:
John Boocock(Italy), Mark Wightman(France), Steve Jones(Turkey) were the
relevant players on the board involved.
Shaun Derrick was the tournament director at MasterCon and he actually 
was informed about the following situation as it was happening.
When Mark Wightman approaches John Boocock about a formal IF DMZ,
John tells Mark that Mark must give John a 5 pound security deposit
before he will even talk to Mark, which John will keep if Mark breaks the DMZ.
While Mark is talking to Toby Harris (who clearly knows what John is doing)
about John's request, Mark notices John approaching Austria and Turkey.
Steve Jones appears to accede to John's request, and ``something'' changes
hands.
Mark decides he had better accept the offer too and gives John the 
<i>$</i>5 security deposit.
The standard IF DMZ held until Fall 1905 (or '06, but it doesn't matter,
with varying degrees of difficulty between Mark and John),
when John asks Mark for support to Munich while John's Italian fleet 
moves to Western Med.
Mark says OK, but says the fleet has to stay in Tunis.
They agree, but both are lying -
Mark stabs by convincing the crippled Germany to support HIM to Munich
instead while John moves F Tun-Wes.
Mark tacitly agrees that this breaks the agreement and doesn't bring up
the return of the five pounds from John.
In the final season in the game, Steve Jones takes four Italian 
centers (using no supports with three of the centers potentially
defended by Italian units), so that Mark and Steve ``tie'' with
13 centers each.

<p>
Every ``fact'' here is cited by at least two participants in the
exchanges (I've left out some other speculations or statements
by only one party about the behavior of others).  
After tournament director Shaun Derrick was
informed, but with no direct complaints from players
(it's not entirely clear how much detail Shaun knew and
which players talked to him though), the scores stood.
If there were to be any type of sanctions or anything like that
anyway, it needed to take place on site, immediately.  Especially so
since the general details were known to the tournament director 
at the time.  Sanctions issued after the fact are unfair and pointless.
It reminds me of the way, in the US, where NCAA basketball removes teams
from the Final Four record book when the break rules, such as with
Marcus Camby and UMass.
It's basically a joke.
Once Mark and Steve were permitted to go forward with their scores intact, 
that game was over and the next one had begun.

<p>
Strangely enough, both Steve Jones and Mark Wightman ended up on the
``Top Board'' table and would have done so even if all of those
final centers had not changed hands.
I agree with what Shaun and many others say about what the tournament
directors can do in such situations.
If you ban particular behaviors outright, then you drive them underground.
It may be ``better'' for them not to be illegal so that they are openly
admitted and discussed, so that they can be dealt with ``within the game''
where (in my opinion) they belong.
These sorts of incidents have been escalating in the Brit hobby over the
last few years as the tournaments have become more and more competitive,
with some international debates between players of different 
nationalities - especially in the explicitly international tournaments.

<p>
In 1994, at World DipCon IV, I admit to being a bit surprised at how
many people carefully ``played the tournament'' by grabbing centers
at the end from players who were just ``playing the games''.
As most of you know, there also were criticisms about players assisting
fellow countrymen at their own expense.
Much of these difficulties arise from the three types of players one
finds at major tournament conventions.
First are the players who play in these Cons often, they are serious,
and they are there to win.
Second are the players who are just there to play and know they have
no chance of winning the tournament.
They may be naive about how tournaments are played, or like John
Boocock, they may see an ``opportunity''.
Indeed, John played in JUST this one game.
Third are the very good players who might get psyched into the
pitch of the tournament by a good showing in their first game,
but would never ``give away their place'' in any game for money or 
other bribes, nor would they be extorted by an offer like John made.
Most probably they would finish back in the pack.
Most tournaments deal with this by having a ``Top Board'' in the final
game to avert the problems that are even more likely in the final game
in a tournament otherwise.
At MasterCon, Toby Harris ended up winning the tournament as a whole,
Mark Wightman finished third, and Steve Jones finished seventh
after each made the final board.
As you can imagine, much of the British talk about this centers on the
personalities and issues with these particular individuals.
That is not my point.
You can see some of Mark Wightman's comments on this in the letter column below
as I verified some facts with him.

<p>
This is worth commenting on as many of you prepare to go and play
in World DipCon at Chapel Hill.
I talk a lot about ``levels'' of the game as a shorthand way of
analyzing what is going on in any particular game.
To me, this is a natural way of expanding the simple ``tit-for-tat''
idea in standard game theory where otherwise language fails.
As a simple example, consider first a gunboat game with no negotiation
allowed and no one knows who is playing which power.
The only ``level'' of the game is the tactical moves themselves and
the negotiation that those moves can communicate.
Then move to ``at the table'' open negotiation.
Everyone knows who each other are, but the level of those interactions
is limited because nothing can be said away from the table.
Some prior experience with particular players can be important here.
That's another level.
Then allow the standard FTF private negotiations where
personality and prior experiences between players can influence
what they do even more.
Another level.
Now things start to get subtle.
Having bribes or side payments going on is certainly another level
of the game.
So is the mere fact that the game is part of a larger tournament
with implications beyond that particular game.
Most importantly, so are a whole host of psychological and personality
oriented strategies that play to particular personality quirks in
the players in any particular game.
Most of these levels are added onto a game by the choices of 
the players involved, as opposed to where I began with ``big picture''
levels that everyone can see clearly.
But it is not always with full and open disclosure and permission
where the level of the game changes on this basis.

<p>
I cannot say this more clearly: It is the magic and the challenge of
the game of Diplomacy that permits 
and occasionally demands that the game be played on so many
levels within the same game.
To me, you play Diplomacy, you do it with the maturity and knowledge
that ALL THINGS are potentially in play.
You can take steps WITHIN THE GAME to try to keep particular levels
out of play.
For example, Mark Wightman could have stood at the table with all players
present and made the side payments completely public (either before
or after he himself ``paid'') in an effort to change the level of the
interactions, or perhaps to shame John Boocock into altering his strategy.
But, at the end of the day, the infinite combinations of decisions
by seven players determine what levels are in play and how they sort out
on the board. 

<p>
The other issue, that was a natural outgrowth of concerns expressed
on the aforementioned side payment issue, was the role of Not For Print
(NFP) letters in the hobby.
I want to take the opportunity in mentioning it that the official policy of
this editor and this szine is that there are no such thing as NFP letters.
If you would put an NFP label on a letter and send it to me, be assured
that I will treat the letter just as if the label wasn't there.
If you're uncomfortable with that, don't send it to me.
This policy always serves me well in keeping me out of feuding loops
I'd rather not be in.
Some of you are thinking, but I've written Jim NFP letters and he hasn't
published them.... well, yes, let me explain further.

<p>
Stephen Agar also presents a very useful taxonomy (Luke, that's your word
for this issue... c.f. typology) of NFP letters.
First, there are the personal revelations of family, illnesses, or other
personal problems which people make.
As many of you know who have sent me such letters, I have gone to 
great lengths to protect the details and nature of such personal
revelations from being items of debate in the hobby as a whole.
That's probably why I continue to receive these letters on a 
fairly regular basis.
To me, though, my dealing with these letters is a matter of individual
trust between me and the letter writer.
If you're near the border on an issue (you write me an NFP letter that
you're having financial problems and you're thinking of folding and
keeping all of your sub money while publicly you are ``pushing'' new
subs), see the policy above.

<p>
Second, there are the letters that make unfavorable comments about
the character or behavior of a third party that someone would put
NFP on so that the subject of the letter would not see the allegations.
Generally, I find these letters low, especially when they are conducting
MegaDiplomacy and I do not acknowledge the NFP labels on these letters.
I don't want to hear them.
In an interesting link back to the levels of the game, the exception to
this, perversely enough, is the ``game letter'' where the third party is
another player in the game.
Printing or publicizing game negotiation letters is, of course, letter
passing at its most shameful.
Letter passing is another ``level'' in a game, and must be dealt with
within the game as all such behavior must in my eyes.
But, if it's not in a game, where you accept assignment with a particular
group of seven players for a specific game, it's an NFP letter but I'll
consider it published if you send it to me.
So if you don't want it published, don't send it to me.
The incentive and result should be clear - it has always worked for me.

<p>
Third, someone can put NFP on a letter to me specifically attacking ME!
Ordinarily, this is done as an explicit feuding tactic to get the letter's
receiver to look bad in public.
No matter how one responds they are likely to have difficulty living
with themselves and can have lost ``tempo'' with the original sender.....
unless you have my NFP policy.
I print it, I laugh at how you are attacking me, and in fact I require
it in the press for my games if you are going to attack anyone else.
This tends to keep all abuse on the ``fun'' level.
It works for me, and I recommend it to Stephen Agar who is struggling
with the issue at present.
I apologize (a little bit) for going on at length about such difficult
issues, which may not be affecting the US hobby at all at the present time.
I've always argued that one of the ways that we keep out of trouble
is by putting these issues on the table in public... gee, that NFP
policy isn't a coincidence, is it?
I hope and pray that the more dynamic and active Brit hobby isn't torn
apart by feuding over these issues, and indeed, it is just a natural
extension of debates I've been watching at least since 1994 in the UK.
Let's have some fun and play some games!!

<p>
Now, I get to the ``boring stuff''.
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR DAN STAFFORD</center><br></b>

<p>
<p><b>Mike Barno (5/2/98)</b>

<p>
Hi, Jim, No, you apparently didn't send me issue 202 twice.
<b>One</b> hardcopy is the optimum number.
<i>((Agreed.))</i>
I finally got to view a current issue on-line yesterday.

<p>
If I remember while visiting my mother, I'll look through old
issues of Dan Stafford's United league.
That was the Sleaze's main positive contribution to the hobby:
When Bill Becker, who had pioneered United in the USA,
gave up running the K-League, Dan volunteered to take it over.
He did a good job GMing and publishing for a couple of years
before folding.
Both before and after K-League was rehoused, it featured a large and
active group of team managers writing plenty of press and discussion
of rule proposals.
So keeping it going was in the public interest, and I'm not just
saying that because my Team Grand National won the league 
championship both years Stafford ran it.

<p>
His sarcastic wit only occasionally appeared in that 'zine; mainly
he stuck to administrative notes.
<i>((Dan was the quintessential non-MegaDipper.
Most of his best writing was in private negotiation letters.))</i>

<p>
Another place to look would be the <i>Diplomacy By Moonlight</i>
issue where Eric Ozog, Dan, and I exposed one of Bernie ``Oaklyn's''
(Tretick's) pseudonyms.
<i>((I remember it well, I don't have my DipSzines especially 
well organized though...))</i>

<p>
(Later:) I looked through a few issues of Stafford's <i>Angst
United</i> but didn't get any particularly noteworthy quotes.
Mostly explanations of why Kevin Brown would never learn
to play or GM well.

<p>

<center>Later, Mike, 634 Dawson Hill Road, Spencer, NY  14883</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Yup, the same thing I found when I looked over all the
<b>North Sealth, West George</b>'s where his subszine was.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
Greetings From Peery in San Diego!

<p>
I am in the process of updating my address book; which now includes some
3,000 names in nearly 35 countries.  Some of you have addresses that are
hard to check (e.g. a compuserve number); since I am in a hurry.  So, I
am sending this to all of you.

<p>
THIS MESSAGE IS ONLY FOR DIPLOMACY HOBBYISTS.  

<p>
The rest of you will get other messages during the course of this
weekend.

<p>
IF YOU ARE A DIPLOMACY HOBBYIST OR PLAYER, PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE
FOLLOWING:

<p>
1) I have created a web page devoted to Diplomacy at the following
address:

<p>
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7969

<p>
This page now includes a ``shrine" to WORLD DIPLOMACY CON, complete with
information about this year's event, past events, photographs, and even
some music!  

<p>
It also includes what may be the first ``chat room" in a Diplomacy
magazine.  You are welcome to use that until we establish a formal
program for using the room.  I am hosting the room for the time being on
behalf of <i>THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH</i>.

<p>
If you visit my Diplomacy page, please sign my guest book (at the end of
the page), so I'll know you've been there.  I plan to update the rest of
the page soon.

<p>
2) I will be attending WDC in Chapel Hill in the next few weeks.  I hope
Dan Barnes and Borger Borgersen will also be attending to help me defend
the WDC Team event championship.  If they don't, and you'd be interested
in being on that team, please let me know.

<p>
We will be arriving on Thursday and staying over until Tuesday, if any
of you intend to make a holiday of it.  

<p>
I have made no commitments or promises to support any WDC event after
next year's event in Namur, Belgium.  

<p>
If you are a foreigner planning on visiting this years event and need
last minute travel advice, please email me SOON!  

<p>
3) I plan to resume operation of the WWPDC very shortly.  With luck I
may have the results out before WDC.

<p>
That's it for now.  If your email address is incorrect, or you know of
anyone who should be on my emai list (which hasn't been updated since
last fall); please have them contact me.

<p>

<p><br><p><br><b>Mark Wightman (Tue, 12 May 1998 12:13:34 -0400 (EDT))</b>
 
Good point about the three types of players. I think that at the European
Championships you should be able to `expect' a certain standard of play.
I've covered this further in my article in the <i>Sprout</i> #26. 
But what it boils down to is I think that you should be able to expect 
that everybody is playing with the same `game' goal in mind. 
John Boocock played simply to have a laugh (at the expense of the serious 
players) and to make some money.
Both reasons are pretty naff, but neither is against the rules.
<i>((Yup, and pretty much unavoidable.  It's an unfortunate part of the
game and why I support the idea of forming ``Top Board" games to
finish a tournament.
On the other hand, though, I think it should be dealt with within the game.
For example, you could have gotten together with Austria and Turkey to 
put Boocock out of the game with an even center split.
I know that is difficult to manage within the game, but ``who the players
are" must always be considered in one's play.))</i>

<p>
John's request was for my A(Bur) to support A(Tyr) - Mun in a spring
season. This suited my purpose in that it helped me secure the low-countries
from Gihan who was playing Germany. Gihan wasn't impressed that John had
done this as it completely ruined any hope Gihan had of recovering and made
his survival to the end of the game unlikely. It was fairly straightforward
then to persuade Gihan to play a `Pascal's Triangle' and support me into
Munich.

<p>
What annoys me, in retrospect, was that John could effectively spoil a game
for six serious competitors (Austria - ManorCon champ 96, England - London
Champ (then rated UK No 1), Germany - Gihan - Very experienced
international player, Russia - Per Westling who had travelled from Sweden
where he has probably won numerous competitions, Turkey - Steve is the No 2
rated UK postal player and was 5th in the tournament overnight (don't know
his ftf record though), France was me - ManorCon 97 champ and joint 2nd
overnight). He was hopelessly out classed and knew it, but decided to turn
the situation to his financial advantage, although he does this too in every
postal game he plays.
<i>((That's too bad.  He is raising himself quite a stink.
Eventually, people will refuse to play with him.
Responding to my comment on what he COULD have done to try to
defuse the situation on the spot...))</i>

<p>
I could have indeed done that. Some people believe I should have, whilst
several believe I should have walked out. Walking out never crossed my mind,
whilst when John made his demand the first thing I thought was `why would I
do that?'; because I knew if he had offered to pay me a fiver if I didn't
attack him - then I'd have taken it and laughed in his face when I did get
around to stabbing him.

<p>
<i>((I did notice that John VERY carefully chose the nature of his ``bet" to
maximize the chances that he was ``paid off".  You did about what
one can do in that kind of situation.  I certainly don't think you
should take any heat for your actions, either here or at future 
tournaments.
Then, commenting on letter passing....))</i>

<p>
OK, I wasn't going to comment, but I simply have to! I agree wholeheartedly,
passing letters on is beyond the pale. The first time I came across it was
when I received a photocopy of a letter I had written to one player from a
third player. One rather key phrase had been blacked out changing the
emphasis. After that I didn't trust either of them. It confused me though.
The first player had his reasons for passing the letter on, whilst the
second wished to show the first was an untrustworthy snitch, by being an
untrustworthy snitch! 
<i>((Interesting how letter passing changes the whole nature of a game, isn't
it?  Then, responding to my `Let's have some fun and play some games!!'...))</i>

<p>
So do I, but I think we are probably safe. I can only speak for myself, but
none of what has been said or written about the event has upset me in the
least, with one exception. I'll confess, that I am worried that myself and
Steve will receive some sort of backlash at the next convention, which for
me will be WorldDipCon. Perhaps I should play under an alias?
<i>((I don't think you need to do that.  You didn't start the business
and are EXTREMELY unlikely to start something like that in the future.
In Britain, it may be another story, though, I don't have the perspective.
In any case, most of the top US players are reading this now and will
undoubtedly judge for themselves.
I expect they would react about how I am reacting.))</i>

<p>

These are all available at the Modern homepage:

<p>
http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
It has results from 47 email games.  

<p>
Thus far there have been 17 solo victories, three each for Spain,
Ukraine, and Russia, 2 for Turkey, Germany, and Italy, and one each
for Egypt and Poland.  The overall ranking is
Spain, Ukraine, Egypt, Russia, Turkey, Germany, Italy, Poland, 
Britain, France.  

<p>
Which is totally skewed by the fact that all of the Spanish victories
are very recent.  A year ago, the leaders were Turkey, Egypt, and
Italy.  Egypt is a good power for getting into a draw, but very
difficult to win with, as getting good penetration into the continent
is difficult.  I initially thought Turkey was weak, but she holds her
own in the stats.  Russia is a nice huggy bear, Ukraine tends to get
trapped in the Balkans, Italy is a cool power to play, and Germany can
be fun too.  Britain has growth problems, as does Spain.  Poland
starts very small, and cannot grow quickly, but has a nice set of home
SCs which support each other.  But my fave power is France.  Ports on
both sides of Gibraltar, little vulnerability to England, and a
reasonable set of accessible SCs.  I still can't believe it's in last
place in the HoF!  

<p>
Incidentally, there are optional air force rules, which I'm using in
the hand-adjudicated game Air Force One.  You can read about them at
the homepage also.  But if people aren't used to the variant at all,
it's probably better that you're not using the air forces.  

<p>
I'm glad to see you running a Modern game.  I was tempted to join, but
I figure Show Me the Money is enough for now.   Modern is my fav
variant.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>
My leadoff comments in this section for the rest of the year will feature
some impressions of the great party singles of all time, from my perspective,
of course.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
Then, I'm going to set a slate of 10-20 or so and DEMAND votes from
you out there.
I may get a bit obnoxious on that score as the great freedom to work and play
will generate a responsibility to offer some opinions as we near the end of
the century.
``Do I Know You?'' won't make the list, but its message gets us started.

<p>
What will get us started is some ``One Hit'' wonder party songs.
As a representative from the 80's, I would nominate ``I Melt With You''
by Modern English.
If any of you own the CD single of this song, like I do, you will agree
that the ``Bass Mix'' crunches the stomach more than any number of curls
could do, but any version is great.
I don't know where Modern English came up with that killer bass line, but
it might be one of the better ones ever plucked.
When you add to that brilliant progressions and classic ``come fuck me''
lyrics, you have the makings of one of those songs that demand attention
and put people together on the dance floor.

<p>
Greetings!

<p>
Yes, I am on-line but only in a quasi-fashion. A co-worker showed me 
this Hotmail thingie and I have an account here. I find it useful, but I 
can only access it at work (no working modem at home) and then only at 
certain hours when the Internet machine isn't being used by people 
needing it for story research and the like. Thus, any email sent to me 
may not be seen for a day or two or three. Still, it's a useful thing. 
I have no plans to offer <i>VERTIGO</i> on-line and I do not wish to have zines 
sent to me via email. For now, it's just a communications tool. I will 
accept letters and orders for <i>VERTIGO</i> this way, though.

<p>
#200 was superb. Brilliant. I loved it. I really haven't looked at 201 
yet, and here comes 202! My, my. I reserve the right to comment on #201, 
but here's a run through #202:

<p>
First, Eric Brosius' request. I am awed that he can play any Beethoven 
sonatas. They are formidable even without all the baggage of being a 
masterpiece, etc., and then there's the spiritual side of things as 
represented by, say, Op. 111. The ``Hammerklavier'' is a symphony for 
piano.

<p>
I will make three recommendations for Eric, based on price.
First, at full price I recommend Richard Goode on Nonesuch. Powerhouse 
playing with plenty of emotion, but not frilly or overly romantic. Very 
direct, I think, and still spiritual,
if not in the Kempffian vein. Goode has awesome sound and the best 
annotations. I think Tower sells his set for around $100.

<p>
Second, at mid-price, Kempff on DG. The sound's a little dated, but what 
I have heard from this set is pure spirit and atmosphere. Kempff cannot 
match Goode's technique and his playing isn't as direct and impactive, 
- slower tempos too - but Beethoven's spirit shines.

<p>
Third, at budget price, Alfred Brendel's Vox set. This, his first 
traversal of the cycle (I think he's done four) is not as cerebral or as 
formidably granitic as his later ones, and the sound isn't as clear, 
although it has oompph. But Brendel's unmannered, yet brilliant, playing 
was what introduced me to Beethoven's late piano music and it is still 
my touchstone. His Op. 111 is sublime. 

<p>
Any of these should be available at Tower; Kempff sells for $60, Brendel 
for $40 or so. 

<p>
<i>((For the balance of playing, price, recording, etc. I think
I would purchase the Brendel if I were Eric.
I actually advised him of that fact as my very first impression
when he sent me the letter, then tried to generate the discussion,
which succeeded.))</i>

<p>
My personal cycle would be Barenboim in the early sonatas, Goode in the 
middle and Brendel late with additions and complements from Novaes, 
Gilels, Russell Sherman, Kempff, Schnabel, and Charles Rosen.

<p>
Barenboim's pianism is just about perfect in the 
Haydn-Mozart-Beethoven-Schubert department. I like brainy Beethoven, as 
you might guess. Yves Nat's hyper-romanticism turns me off in Beethoven. 
Then again, any hyper-romanticism in Beethoven turns me off because I do 
not find him an especially romantic composer. I see him as the 
culmination of 100 years of trends from Bach to Haydn to Mozart. Then, 
since classicism obviously couldn't go much further - just what would 
follow Beethoven's late string quartets, say? - Berlioz and Schubert 
and Mendelssohn and others led us into the hot-house of romanticism from 
which Western music has still not quite recovered. 

<p>
In re crossover and pop: Marsalis' classical discs are NOT crossover. 
They are straight classical, admittedly popular classics, and while I 
can get weary of his brilliantly vivid sound in Baroque music (I don't 
always find it appropriate) he is an accomplished classical artist who, 
also, plays jazz. Andre Previn is another; ditto Gunther Schuller. 
Marsalis could be principal trumpet in a major orchestra, or have a 
classical solo career, if he wanted to. The problem is that the 
repertoire for trumpet is much, much wider in jazz than in art music. 
Orchestras want only a few concertos - Haydn, Hummel, maybe Tomasi, 
Bach's Brandenburg #2 - from a trumpeter, and just try and name a solo 
sonata. Hindemith; Halsey Stevens; anybody else? As an artist, Marsalis' 
choice makes sense. 
<i>((I would agree.
Marsalis is the absolute best I can think of at that type of crossover.))</i>

<p>
Popular classics - Satie's Gymnopedies, Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, 
Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker, Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite, say - are not 
crossover. What is crossover is Yo-Yo Ma playing Appalachian waltzes. 
Opera singers performing Andrew Lloyd Webber. Vapid violinists arranging 
popular melodies in a ``Classical'' style. Michael Bolton - God help us 
all - singing (that's really not quite the word) Verdi and Puccini. 
That's crossover.
<i>((Agreed!))</i>

<p>
Now there is successful crossover. Rhapsody in Blue once was crossover; 
it's now part of the repertoire. I don't find crossover appalling per 
se; Ma's waltz disc is pretty and pleasant, nice background listening. 
Bolton's disc is an appalling mess. But I would rather listen to Ma 
perform Bach, Walton, or Beethoven than silly things such as folk 
waltzes. Still, Ma's disc is not an assault on music like Bolton's is 
and that's how I draw the line between crossover and classical. 
<i>((Yes, how do you see Richard Thompson's latest disc (which I 
will review in full next time) or something like Joel Cohen recording
the Weill <b>Johnny Johnson</b>, also perhaps reviewed next time....))</i>

<p>
I will even give David Helfgott credit for trying to be a real musician 
playing real music. He cannot, of course, and his discs are not so much 
crossover as horribly failed classical music. 

<p>
In general, classical musicians should leave pop music - as opposed to 
popular classics - to pop musicians and vice versa. A few, such as 
Marsalis, can do both with no loss of artistry or integrity. Marsalis' 
disc, In Gabriel's Garden, of Baroque music is stunning if, as I said, a 
little tiring to the ear (all that virtuosity and brilliance). 

<p>
You bring up opera singers. Bernstein's West Side Story is a perfect 
crossover work - not really an opera, yet more than a musical. Yet it 
works best with Broadway voices singing it, not Kiri Te Kanawa, whose 
recording (DG) is lovely but detached, and Jose Carraras isn't earthy 
enough. What I want in WSS is Broadway voices backed by a full orchestra 
(the NYPO would be perfect) conducted by (well, Bernstein, but RIP 
Lenny) someone like Skitch Henderson. I'd buy that disc! ``I Feel 
Pretty'' is one of my favorite songs.
<i>((I may go hunt that one up!))</i>

<p>
I will call you on Washington not being a great military leader. Even 
leaving Mike's points aside - and they are valid - I believe 
Washington was a brilliant, even visionary, strategist but an ordinary 
tactician. It's hard to fault the grand scheme of any of Washington's 
operations except perhaps the battles around New York in 1776, when he 
acted with a strange combination of rashness and lassitude. Boston in 
1775 was a strategic success. Trenton-Princeton saved the American cause 
from defeatism in that bleak winter of 1776-77. His manuevers around 
Philadelphia in 1777 were at worst unlucky and at best inspired. The 
central Jersey campaign in 1778 should have destroyed Clinton's army. 
And Yorktown was Washington seizing an opportunity the only time it 
would be available to him, coordinating large sea and land forces and 
executing with perfection. You will note that the only outright American 
disasters on land - Charleston and Camden in 1779-1780 - happened with 
Washington a thousand miles away. 

<p>
Now, what is true is that Washington's tactics were less than dazzling, 
especially at Long Island and Germantown (too simple at one, too complex 
at the latter). But I contend that his vision of what the American army 
had to do to win the war saved the cause and created America. I would 
argue that his strategy, generally counter to the 18th-century ideas of 
``strategic places'', was years ahead of its time in that he understood 
that what kept the Revolution alive was the Army and it must be 
preserved, even at the cost of major cities (New York, Philadelphia, 
Charleston). I would argue that as a strategist Washington had no equal 
in the 18th-century except perhaps the elder Pitt.

<p>
Even Washington's tactics might have been successful if his subordinates 
had been equal to them. His operational commanders were competent, 
usually, but little more; generals such as Sullivan, Wayne, Lord 
Sterling, Lafayette, and Putnam fit that description. Only Knox, in 
charge of the artillery, and Greene were distinguished and Greene's 
great gifts were as a strategist, not a tactician, as well; Greene's 
ordinary handling of his brigade in the Northern campaigns in no way 
foreshadowed the brilliance he would show as a strategist in the South 
in 1780 and 1781. The best example of Washington being let down by his 
generals was Monmouth Court House in 1778, when his plan, if executed 
even moderately competently and quickly, would almost certainly have 
inflicted a sharp defeat on Clinton. But the (pick one) 
lazy/arrogant/traitorous General Charles Lee's insubordination and 
inepitude cost Washington dearly there. 

<p>
If you want to charge Washington with not choosing the best generals he 
could have, that's perhaps legitimate, except that political realities 
not of his making tied his hands sometimes, and I admit that he, 
intimdated by Lee's ``professionalism'', gave Lee too much rope. But I 
insist that as a strategist Washington is unequaled in U.S. military 
history. Grant? He didn't operate on Washington's scale and he had 
material advantages far beyond Washington. R.E. Lee? The opposite of 
Washington - a dazzling tactician who didn't see the big picture all 
that well. George Marshall? I don't think so - Yalta and the Cold War 
were the result of misguided Allied strategy in World War II. MacArthur? 
No. Ernest King? See Marshall. Hyman Rickover? Close, but no cigar. It 
may have been true that Washington was fortunate in his foes, but none 
of the British generals in America were outright buffoons, and several 
- Howe, Clinton, Cornwallis - were above average. 

<p>
By the way, I would also contend that the greatest American tactician of 
the war was, without any doubt, Benedict Arnold. Arnold was the real 
victor at Saratoga, and he saved Albany in 1776 as well. He never worked 
under Washington; too bad. Arnold at Germantown or Monmouth would have 
been a very different story than Sullivan and Charles Lee. Richard 
``Light-Horse'' Harry Lee was a brilliant cavalryman, and Daniel Morgan 
second to none on the frontier, but Arnold's tactics and execution 
lacked very little except, frequently, enough men to win the battle (see 
Quebec).

Hey Jim, Tell Mr. Duxon.... oh hell - I'll tell him myself!
Hey, Pete - I knew you weren't one of those ``damned British
prudes'' when I saw you signed your letters Pete.
If you were, it would be Peter, right?

<p>
Okey - so America has a vein of ``Americs - love it or leave it - God's
on our side'' types.
So does every other country on earth - though the cause of the ``rightness''
of each may differ.
But, it's long past Manifest Destiny and the Moral Majority ain't that major.
The vast majority, I would venture, don't believe that way.
There is much about America (much as I love her) which, quite frankly,
sucks the big one.
But, even I get defensive when it seems like my country is being unjustly
criticized, not that this is what you were up to.
It seems to me that America takes a lot of guff for the world's ills we 
don't deserve.
Barring the political bent to any situation, our ``heart'' is generally in
the right place.

<p>
It just seems to me that when someone begins a sentence with ``I don't see how 
you...'' or ``I just don't understand how you...'' etc., they should consider 
replacing the pronoun first.
And, of course, I knew your comments were ``good-natured''.
As are mine.

<p><br><p><br><b>John Harrington (Tue, 12 May 1998 18:40)</b>

<p>
Jim,
There were a couple of things in the last <i>TAP</i> letter column that caught my 
eye but I can only remember one of them now - the other probably involved me 
wishing to hurl abuse at the whole pomp rock pantheon (ELP, Yes, et al) so 
it's probably best that I don't give in to something as futile and childish 
as trashing someone else's music tastes purely on the grounds that they 
disagree with my own.

<p>
The one issue I can remember was to do with Pete Duxon's comments about the 
insularity of Americans.  This is often commented on by we Europeans, often 
in a sniffy manner.  I think, however, that given that the USA is an 
enormous place, with a huge number of people and, as you say, with a very 
wide range of cultures and features, it is perfectly understandable that 
Americans don't pay much attention to what happens in the rest of the world, 
particularly when anything of any great import eventually makes its way to 
the States anyway.

<p>
Of course, what is less understandable is why some Americans are not even 
interested in what happens in the next town, never mind the next state or 
country, but that's another issue and I am sure there are lots of people in 
Britain with a similar mentality.  In the county of Yorkshire, for instance, 
you are practically ostracised if you so much as suggest that the county is 
not just the centre of the universe but is the whole universe itself 
(Yorkshire people try to pass this off as self-mocking but deep down 
....well, take Tony Dickinson, for example.)
<i>((Yes, take Tony Dickinson please!!
Just kidding, Tony....))</i>

<p>
Without wishing to put words into Pete's mouth, I think what rankles 
``foreigners" about the USA is the mentality of some of the people we come 
across on Internet newsgroups or news broadcasts who extend the concept of 
the USA's role as ``leader of the free world" to something more akin to ``the 
only hope of the free world" or the only country in the world that is truly 
free.  Or truly democratic.  The phrase ``only in America" is often 
guaranteed to get me reaching for a brick to hurl at the telly.

<p>
Of course, anyone who pays any attention to the nut-cases infesting Usenet 
groups or who appear on CNN vox-pops is a nut-case themself, particularly if 
they take the views of those people and extrapolate them to tarnish an 
entire nation.  Nonetheless there is a bit of knee-jerk reaction in Europe 
and we have to be restrained from observing that the Greeks might have been 
tootling around with this concept of democracy a while before America 
declared independence, and that Britain's Houses of Parliament pre-date the 
creation of Congress by a few hundred years if memory serves.  One might 
also feel inclined to argue that citizens in some countries - Holland and 
the Nordic countries spring to mind - have more basic freedoms than US 
citizens, but the whole argument might founder on the definition of 
``freedoms".   (By the way, is it OK to stand for election as a Communist in 
the post-Cold War USA or is that an invitation to get locked up PDQ?)

<p>
<i>((Oh, there is a legal Communist party now and has been for quite
some time.
There also is no chance of victory for their candidates.
Do you also have dozens of tiny parties who put up candidates who lose?
As I recall, in the Presidential election of 1996, there were about 25
candidates who officially made the ballot in one or more states.
The Communist party was one of them.
Remember, also, the assertion I made at one point, that the REAL democratization
of America that is different from the Greeks, the Brits, or anyone else of
which I am aware is the democratization of religion and the extent of freedom
of religion.
The history has its unfortunate stories (the persecution and murder of Joseph
Smith and forcing the Mormons to Utah), but by and large America is characterized
by the democracy of its religious tradition.
This really got going in the early 19th Century when the Baptists and Methodists
started using ``uneducated'' ministers, which shocked the Anglicans and 
Congregationalists, but started us on a democratic populist track that still
influences our culture today EVEN given the unreligious nature of the ``popular''
culture.))</i>

<p>
In that respect, encouraging Americans to learn more about the history and 
activities of other countries would be no bad thing, but then I was reminded 
when reading other parts of <i>TAP</i> that I know bog-all about the War of 
Independence; oddly enough, British history, as taught in schools, 
concentrates more on those occasions when we trounced the French or defeated 
the Spanish than it does on those events when we got our arses kicked by a 
bunch of Dutch farmers in Africa or erstwhile colonists in the Americas.
<i>((See more from Brad Wilson above...))</i>

<p>
The piece about Washington in the last <i>TAP</i> where he refused to be made king 
brought home to me for the first time (guess I'm a bit slow or unthinking 
some times) what an amazing step it was to create a new country without 
royalty.  Once this realisation clicked into place, I could then understand 
why the creation of this idealistic republic is equated by *some* Americans 
with ``the invention of democracy".  In 1960's parlance, I think I now see 
where Americans are coming from when they make these extravagant claims.
<i>((I think the lack of state religion is equally important, but perhaps
some would disagree.
Recall, this in a nation with the motto, ``In God We Trust''.))</i>

<p>
OK, so that's me educated about the birth of the USA, can any of your 
readershp now educate me about what was so great about 1789 and the French 
revolution ....?  Seems like just a bunch of people running round lopping 
heads off for no good reason.  We in Britain have been lopping heads off for 
no good reason for centuries and needed no namby pamby excuses about 
liberty, equality and freedom to do so (writes Major Phipps-Partington-Smyth 
[retd.]  of Tunbridge Wells).

<p>
You seem to have been disappointed not to have got more feedback from 
Britons on the Hong Kong issue last year.  If you could not get Pete 
``rent-an-opinion" Birks to write about it then clearly it is not an issue 
that has greatly troubled the chattering classes.  I'm not anywhere nearly 
as well read as Birks so don't feel qualified to pass an intelligent comment 
on it, beyond a gut feeling that we treated the HK subjects shabbily.  My 
view is only based on a few 10 minute discussions on news programs that I 
saw though - to get even a halfway decent understanding of the underlying 
issues one has to read the quality press and I must confess I zoomed past 
those articles to get to the football reports.
<i>((Could it be that the British policy was *wrong*?  ;-)  Nah....))</i>

<p>
I presume that if we ever do hand over the Falklands/Malvinas to Argentina 
that the mostly white islanders will be welcomed in the mother-land with 
open arms.  There's always room for a few more sheep-shaggers in the 
Shetlands.

Hi Boob!
Seems the only way I get mail from my French neighbor is to either pass
German notes (ha!) or relate it to your <i>AP</i> pubbing effort (cackle).  Of
course, it doesn't help when the ``speedy advance e-mail results" will
actually not arrive until I'm eligible for Social Security!  (And that,
by the way, is only 1.5 years ahead of you, Old Fart of Arsenic!)  

<p>
So, with no further ado, here's my sorry attempt at listing the Ten
``Fassio Desert Island Classics."  Two items of advance note, however:

<p>
1) I would much prefer to have 10 CDs on the island with me, i.e., the
ten favorite Faz Bands, thus allowing me greater song flexibility.
However, if 10 songs are the limit, then so be it.  Must've recorded a
pretty small 60-minute cassette, is all I can say!

<p>
2) Steve Emmert stole some of my good bands, which is natural, as we're
really twin sons of different mothers (Dan Fogelberg/Tim Weisberg,
1981?).  Unlike Steve and some of the other more, shall we say, educated
artistes who grace your 'zine (sniff...), my selections will NOT contain
lists from the following categories:

<p>
- Opera (fat white foreigners yelling in loud voices)

<p>
- Rap (fat black people with funny names, yelling in loud voices)

<p>
- Country (skinny white people with nasal inflections, singing about
coon dogs and drinking beer when their girl leaves them)
<i>((Except for Merle Haggard's ``Okie From Muskogee'', that's gonna
make the `singles' list I start above.
By the way, this was an album list, not a singles list, so you could
have way more music, we'd even let you choose Greatest Hits collections.))</i>

<p>
- Classical (dead white people who don't even sing, and title all their
songs in Latin).  

<p>
Ok, having got THAT out of the way, here's what you'd hear from my tape
player if we were on an island.  

<p>
- Enrico Snoop Latifah, Opus Fugue 61 (English title:  ``I'm Pickin' My
Nose, 'Cause You Picked Another"), played on oboe in C Flat Aggregato.
Hey, WAIT A MINUTE; how'd THAT get in here?!  Here's the real stuff!

<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<p>
- Blue Oyster Cult, ``Don't Fear the Reaper''.  A Cult classic, and the
defining song for the band.  The first song I heard on the radio when I
got discharged from the Army, and the one that hooked me on the band.

<p>
- Bruce Springsteen, ``Tunnel of Love''.  Anyone who doesn't include at
least one song from ``The Boss" or the ``Jersey Sound" (Eddie Money,
Southside Johnny, etc) is a Communist, and should be put on an island
with nothing but game press from Jim-Bob Burgess and Don Williams.
<i>((But there is no such thing as game press from Don Williams any more.))</i>

<p>
- Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, ``Suite, Judy Blue Eyes''.  David Crosby's
anthem to his then-girlfriend, Judy Collins.  Great harmonies.

<p>
- Dave Mason (w/Steve Wonder), ``The Lonely One''.  A personal Faz favorite
from the ex-Traffic star.

<p>
- Joe Walsh, ``Indian Summer''.  A slow tune from the ex-James Gang guy.
Listen to the lyrics.; how one reminisces about simpler days.

<p>
- Allman Brothers Band, ``Dreams I'll Never See''.  Legends of Southern
Rock, with a long, dreamy blend of blues/jazz wailing, and some great
guitar work.

<p>
- Todd Rundgren, ``Real Man''.  A nice all-around tune I never tire of.

<p>
- Steve Stills &amp; Manassas, ``Johnny's Garden''.  Stills had a great band and
this was one of their best tunes.  Are you sure I can't take their debut
album with me on the island, Jim?; there's too many songs to choose from
with this group!
<i>((Absolutely, you misread the rules!))</i>

<p>
- Quicksilver Messenger Service, ``Fresh Air''.  The 'Frisco sound was
captured by these guys, and this was their ``capstone song," imo.

<p>
- Bad Company, ``Electric Land''.  Captures the continuing Fassio obsession
with slow, brooding songs alternating with high-energy tunes on this
list.

<p>
<i>((Interesting how a year and a half makes us in different generations.))</i>

<p>
Had I had the option for 10 more tunes (I know, I know, I don't have the
option), I'd include something from Foreigner, Journey, Ambrosia,
Jefferson Airplane, James Taylor, Harry Chapin, Hall &amp; Oates, the
Outlaws, Traffic, and Carole King).

On the night of Friday, April 5th, session drummer extrordinaire Cozy Powell
was killed in a one car crash on the M4 near Bristol. He died of his injuries
in hospital. He was 50. It is believed that bad weather contributed to the
crash. He had recently recovered from a foot injury that took him out of the
Malmsteen tour at the time of the crash.

<p>
Powell worked with Page &amp; Plant, Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Keith Emerson &amp; Greg
Lake (under the name Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell), Blue Murder, Beldam, Yngwie
Malmsteen and many others. 

<p>
The private funeral was held on the 18th of April. Condolences may be sent in
care of: Thomas Free &amp; Sons Funeral Directors, The Parade, Marlborough,
Wiltshire, SN8 1NE, England. Further information can be found on his website:

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
I also would really like to open a game of Breaking Away.
Is there any interest at all??
Well, John Schultz and the game's designer John Harrington
are interested.
Others??
You don't need to own the game to play, I'm going to use 
Keith Thomasson's house rules that include the ``how to play the game.''
I printed Keith's rules a few issues back, but some of the shaded parts
didn't reproduce properly.
I'll print the rules properly if I get a bit more interest in the game.
I thank John Harrington for encouraging me in this.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) It's time to get those orders in NOW!
From everything I hear, there was lots of ``getting to know you''
communication getting this started.
Great!!
Now it's time to push the blocks.

<p>
2) Standbys for this game are the three who didn't get into the
game: Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Paul Kenny, and John Schultz.

<p>
3) I'm glad the larger map helped out.
I'll still take input on finding a better map.
This issue, you get the map with the units placed on it.

<p>
4) Thanks to Lee Kendter, Jr. for the 1998Ers31 Miller Number!
This is one of his last acts as Miller Number Custodian.
He reports that he has found the MNC replacement, and will be announcing
the person as soon as he gets a final <i>Alpha and Omega</i> out.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Well, the future is empty, as a dead 
girl's eyes...

<p>
The whole thing smells, but she can't even tell;

<p>
Another wide belly up, another name to forget;

<p>
We've been to Memphis, now let's see what we got left.''

<p>
Some assorted lyrics from ``Eve Future'' off of the Mekons 1994 ``Nashville''
record: <i>Retreat from Memphis</i>.

<p>
(KOKO THE GORILLA-AOL CHAT ROOM USERS): Hi, I'm typing this NAKED!
Are you naked too?

<p>
(A DESERT HERMIT): The nations of the world are like sands in a Desert.
Take heed!
For when a storm arises they are scattered before the wind.
Only then they settle to the Earth, and become dust....

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): Are you with me? 

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Although you keep printing that there are about
50 SCs in this variant, my last attempt to count them came up with 
63 SCs, so I assume that 32 are required for a win.
<i>((I get 64, so I say that makes 33 required for a win.))</i>
Next, are Jeff O'Donnell (Egypt) and Sean O'Donnell (Spain) related?
<i>((I think so, but why don't you check out the next item...))</i>
Finally, although you keep printing that Modern Diplomacy is
very popular on the Judges, I am not exactly sure what you are
writing about.
Yet I can see that the PBM Diplomacy hobby is in an irreversible
decline and that the future lies with PBEM.
So sooner or later I will have to break down, buy a computer, and go 
internet.
<i>((See Rick Desper's letter above.
I actually don't believe the PBM hobby is as doomed as everyone else does.
I think it will be different and smaller, but there is a place for
the kinds of games that I run in the way I run them.
I am absolutely positive of it.
What we are missing is all the energy of the college kids who ``can't
wait'' and are playing 24 hour (orders due every day) games on the
Judges.
Only a Judge can adjudicate that fast and keep up with games that move
so quickly.
Postal games will be those, like the ones here, with 3-6 week deadlines.
And pure postal szines might disappear, but hybrids will not.))</i>
But just what are we talking about in terms of computer power?
To play PBEM, will I need one of those web thingies?
<i>((Nope, people do VERY well with just free juno E-Mail accounts.))</i>
How much modem power?
<i>((Again, if you just do E-Mail, just about any modem will do.))</i>
What is all this going to cost me?
<i>((You can get a used computer set-up very cheap, or buy a cheap
new one for a little over a thousand, I think.))</i>
I'd like some feedback from <i>TAP</i> subbers so as to have some idea what I 
am getting into once I leave the world of the 32 cent stamp.
And what exactly are ``The Judges''?
<i>((Connected to the Internet are servers that support a series of
programs that collectively are called ``judges''.
They pass player communications between players in a game, collect orders,
and adjudicate the games.
GM's work with the Judge to do the extra `personal' stuff.))</i>

<p>
(PLAYER MUSINGS): Two O'Donnell's, both from Ohio, and living 
only twenty or so minutes away. 
Uncle and Nephew meet on the field of battle, seeing each other
most every day in the course of their daily lives. What is the lesson?
Don't be Italy between them. 

<p>
(MAP MUSINGS): What exactly is the point of BOS? It only boarders in 
two other areas, something that no other province does in any Dip 
variant this author has ever seen. Granted, Sakhalin in Colonial Diplomacy boarders only one, but there is a case to be made for that making sense. 
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork, I'm finally winning some converts on that
point!!))</i>
BOS seems to make no sense at all. 

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-FTF DIPLOMACY PLAYERS): The Post Office has FINALLY come around
with new work hours for me.
I now work Tour II, which is 7AM-3:30PM.
My new days off are Sunday and Monday.
So, does anybody know of places in my area where I could play Diplomacy
face-to-face?
Any game conventions in my area?
Clubs?

<p>
(A TURKISH ZEALOT to THE WEST): Ah!
Infidels!
You laugh at our flea bitten camels.
You make jokes about our women.
Worst of all, you despise the milk of our goats!
Be forewarned.
It is easier to thread the eye of a needle with a piece of rope than it
is to fool a herder of our sheep...

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): Are you being true?

<p>
(FRANCE-SPAIN): Thank you for your postcard of 16 April reading ``I would
to establish a non-aggressions pact and how to keep it.''
By now you should have received my return letter packed with the data you
requested.
I do want to apologize for the lack of e-mail, and assure you that I am
starting to think seriously about making The Great Leap Of faith To The
Internet.
<i>((I got that, I got that....))</i>
See PRESS to Burgess above.

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): You need to let me know exactly whats going on. Or 
are you trying to pull a Russia trying to get my eyes pointed away I 
really must know.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-MUSIC LOVERS): The Doctor Demento show is still being 
broadcast live in Los Angeles on Radio Station KLSX-FM, 97.1 on the
dial, with a new schedule of Sunday Evening, 6-8PM.
<i>((Have you heard the novelty single ``Cows With Guns'' yet??
It is said that Demento plays it often.))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN to G.M.): Keep me posted on opening games for Diplomacy for I 
think my survival in this game is not going to last more then 1997 or 
98.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR KENT MURAD ABDUL ATATURK POLLARD): Greetings Ambassadors!
I have given my full name here, but if you like you may all address me
as Ambassador Ataturk Pollard or simply Kent.
I look forward to the coming months of negotiations.
All of you have been written to, but some of you have as yet not
written to me.
My Government is anxious to know and learn your immediate intentions.
Expansion is on everyone's mind.
Let us be Diplomats first and foremost...
<i>((And warriors second???))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-BRITAIN): Thank you for your letter of 24 April.
By the way, I am quite embarrassed that I wrote you such a long letter
under the impression that Russia starts with a Fleet in Murmansk.
It would seem logical.
But no, the unit in Murmansk is an Army, and the 2nd fleet is down
south to annoy the Ukrainians.
Hopefully, with the larger map I won't make such blunders in the future.
<i>((What?
It's the szine above that tells you what everyone starts with...))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN):  HI HAVN'T TALKED TO YAH SO WIE GEHTS?  WAS TUST DU?
WO WHONST DU IN DIE STADT.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): Speaking of which, thanks for the larger map.
<i>((You're welcome.))</i>
It arrived with <i>TAP</i> #202, which arrived on 28 April.
I think I can actually work with this one.
It makes clear such things as Switzerland bordering on FOUR home SCs.
Fun.

<p>
(GERMANY to SPAIN): I hear Naples is beautiful in the spring, wouldn't
you agree?

<p>
(SPAIN to GERMANY): LETS SEE IF THERE IS ANY GOOD MOVIES ON BUT WHERE 
SHOULD WE GO TO SEE IT RUHR PARIS THAT NEW PLACE LYO I HEAR THE GIRLS 
THERE ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD.

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): Your letter of 8 April was the very first letter of this
game to arrive at my PO Box.
Alas, I must regretfully inform you that, at least the last time I checked,
there are no German speakers in Belgium, but lots of French speakers.
I hope you understand what I am hinting at.

<p>
(SPAIN to UNCLE JEFFY POOH): JEFF WHEN ARE YOU EVER GOING TO TAKE US TO 
CASCADE AGAIN OR AT THE VERY LEAST GO CLEAN A BUILDING THE LAST ONE IN 
CLEVELAND WAS FUN.

<p>
(FRANCE-BRITAIN): Your letter of 10 April was the second letter to arrive.
Alas, I must regretfully inform you that, at least the last time I checked,
there are no English speakers in Belgium, but lots of French speakers.
I hope you understand what I am hinting at.

<p>
(GEN. MUSTAFA ``IMPALA'' KEMAL OF TURKEY to WORLD): Remember: when someone
misinterprets the written word, that person may become confused, indecisive,
or perhaps even a bit defensive toward the writer.
But when unwilling to write to others, your actions become the words other
nations read.
And unlike written words, misinterpreted actions tend to be dealt with
swiftly and deliberately, and sometimes result in dire consequences.

<p>
With that said, peace and good tidings to you all!
And as the great Ataturk once said in his famous speech at Geneva,
``It would please me not to have to kill and maim all of you on my
way to total world domination.
Thank you, have a nice day.''

<p>
(SPAIN to THE ALL GREAT ONE): PLAY YOU IN POOL SOMETIME THAT JERRY MADE. 
ALSO HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SECRET SERVICE AROUND LATELY?

<p>
(NEWSFLASH!): This Just In!... in a sensational break in the Whitewater
Savings And Loans investigation, Kenneth Starr has forced Hillary Rodham
Clinton to admit, on the witness stand and under oath, to having had a
sexual relationship with the President of the United States!
Film at 11.

<p>
(UKRAINE-POLAND): You make your move, and I'll follow up.

<p>
(SPAIN to RUSSIA): ????????????????

<p>
(ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED FRANCE-VERBALLY CHALLENGED RUSSIA): I
am typing this on saturday evening, 2 May.
Time to send this PRESS in to the GM.
Alas, I have yet to receive your promised letter, in spite of the fact
that I wrote to you on 12 April.
For that matter, neither have Poland, Ukraine, or Egypt responded to
my initial letters.
You realize, of course, that this means WAR?
If I had a horse, I'd horsewhip you!

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): I WANT TUNIS CAN I PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE ERIC PRETTY 
PLEASE.

<p>
(FRANCE-TURKEY): Thank you for your letter that was received on 23 April,
the alleged birthday of William Shakespeare.
Can this be a coincidence?
We Think Not!
By the way, I have proof that the works alleged to be Shakespeare's
were actually written by somebody else who just happened to have the
exact same name.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): WATCH YOURSELF ON THE ROAD I GOT MY TEMPS AND IF YOU 
DON'T BELIEVE ME ASKE MY UNCLE JEFFY POOH.. EGYPT.

<p>
(BOOB to SEAN): Generally, using ``all caps'' is considered shouting.
If I have time, I'll ``take off'' the shouting, but I don't have time
this issue.
Many famous dippers of the past have gone to the opposite extreme, 
with NO caps.
Thanks for all the press though!
You know I love to get it!!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-ERIC BROSIUS): I don't have a current catalog of all the current
classical CDs, but I am quite sure there must be dozens of Complete
Piano Sonatas of Beethoven.
It all comes down to taste.
You are just going to have to listen to a few on the radio and/or at the store
before plunking down your money.
And do listen carefully, because that will be a lot of money.
Having written that disclaimer.... sample the recordings of Emil Gilels.

<p>
(PIRATE CAPTAIN ANDRUSCHAK-ABUSED GM): You're such a pathetic swab that
I have decided NOT to make you walk the plank.
<i>((Thank you, Jim O'Kelley is the Shark Chum around here....not me.))</i>
I am quite a kind-hearted person, and would hate to give the sharks an
upset stomach.
<i>((Oh.))</i>
Pay attention now!
Schooners are fore-and-aft rigged sailing ships.
You may have noted the triangular sails?
The sails and masts on the S/V MANDALAY, starting at the bowsprit (that means
the front of the ship to a lubber like you) are Flying Jib, Outer Jib,
Inner Jib, Fore Stay Sail, Fore Mast, Fore Fisherman, Main Stay Sail,
Main Mast, Main Fisherman, Mizzen Stay Sail, Mizzen Mast, and Spanker.
On a schooner, ``fishermen'' are the sails that complement the stay
sails.
On the MANDALAY, they were only used for daytime sailing.
At night, we ``shortened sail'' by bringing down the two fishermen, the
spanker, and one or two jibs.
<i>((Well, good that they let the fishermen sleep....))</i>
Oh come now, you didn't really think that I was talking about hanging
those human beings known as ``fishermen'', did you?
Although come to think of it, it might not be a bad idea.
Are You Now, Or Have You Ever Been, A Member Of The Fishermens Party?

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Wow!!

<p>
2) Terry's attempt to use the Suez Canal failed.
The rule is quite explicit.
f med-RS requires a unit to remain in Egypt for the entire turn, but the 
army moved to Sudan.
Given the dastardly Duck's moves, Terry may be pleased he's on the
``right'' side of the canal.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MULDER to SCULLY): Aliens have messed with your head, how could you even
suggest that the world order was going to be threatnened by backstabbing
conspirators supported by extraterrestrial beings.

<p>
(JAPAN-CHINA): I'm not blaming anyone for anything, I just hoped that you
have not decided to side with the Russian against me.

<p>
(FRANCE to CHINA): Who is the gruesome twosome?

<p>
(BOOB to JAPAN): If I read Roland right, and I usually do, I think he has
a better feel for what's up than you do.... I don't think speaking to the
Chinese about the Russian is going to generate that reaction.... there's
no wishin' and hopin' to be done.

<p>
(JAPAN-FRANCE): I hope that you do not plan on going any further north.
I don't care if you have Formosa, but anything further north than that,
I would not appreciate.

<p>
(RADIO FREE EUROPE WORLD REPORT): Russian, French and British Generals met to
discuss world domination over Chinese food provided by the now deceased
General Tso. Chinese troops were seen running for the border yelling, ``yo
quiero Taco Bell." Japanese navies were seen wavering in their commitment to
do anything of real substance. Meanwhile, Dutch navies were reported to be
sailing to India.
 
(TURKISH BARBARIAN'S LAIR):  The Chinese was kneeling before his new love,
``I've never known anyone like you.  Blonds are so uncommon where I live.
I must know if you will return with me to my home land!  I will have to
smuggle you past the British and French barricades but when you see my
land (except for the parts threatened by Japan and Russia) you'll fall in
love anew.  What do you say?  Will you be returning to Beijing with me?"
``Bahhhhhh..." she replied.

<p>
(THE IMPERIAL CHINESE PALACE, PEKING): His muscles bulged and his face turned to
red as he felt the soft skin between his fingers give. Saliva foamed on his
lips as he slowly crushed the life out of this new western looking concubine. 
      
The Imperial Aides stood about watching with the rapt attention that all
weak men display when witnessing a tragedy, or a death of an innocent, as
their Emperor strangled the small woman brought to him for just this purpose.
Carefully applied cosmetics accuentated her round eyes and pale skin 
while a silk dress, carefully and expensivelly dyed to resemble a Union Jack, 
that symbol the Emperor hated more than any other, hung provocatively about 
the dying woman's shoulders. 
      
The Imperial Aides had become accustomed to the sight. On even numbered
days, a woman, always small so as to not pose much difficulty to the Emperor,
was made up as a British Queen and brought before him. Occasionally the
Emperor toyed with this poor retch, talking or pleading with her in a language
she could not possibly understand, but this ended some months ago. Now, when
the Emperor saw the woman he instantly descended upon her, beating her in his
impotent fury as he would like his armies to beat the British. It always ended
the same, with the small Emperor wraping his meaty hands about her small white
neck and squeezing. He especially enjoyed those who fought back, feebly
striking at him as he imagined the British striking at his great empire. 
<i>((Methinks the Emperor wastes his energy on the wrong target...))</i>        

<p>
On even numbered days, a woman, resembling a French whore was brought to him,
with the same result. 
<i>((Ummm, perhaps that one too, but I still don't think he's quite got
the right one....))</i>
       
While the little Emperor released his fury on those he could, small
defenseless women who had no idea what was happening to them or why, military
setbacks continued to be counted about the Empire. The south was being lost
one jungle at a time while the west was collapsing at a remarkable rate. The
once great Chinese army was being defeated on every battlefield while the
Emperor, the supreme military authority killed women made up to look like his
enemies. 
      
The aides stood about as the helpless woman died in the little man's
clutches. Those who dared began to wonder at the irony of this daily ritual. 

<p>
(TURKEY to BOARD): Elderly house guests, first new horse of the summer
(little slate gray filly-Silver Lining), work picking up, just want to
tell you all to ignore Williams, he has NO Toady value what so ever.

<p>
(BOOB to TOADFATHER): Agreed, yet he seems to have gotten your attention.
 
(TBl): The duck was shaking himself off after a few laps in the bidet and
was running a towel in one ear and out the other.  ``Ya know, big fella, if
you don't find another house boy the rest of the board is going to catch
on."  At that moment the butler in all his finery entered and announced,
``Dinner is served, sir.  Will his duckness be joing us or should I lay out
the GOOD china and not the McDonald's happy meal boxes...?"

<p>
(JAPAN-RUSSIA): I do not want to fight you, but if you are not
comfortable in striking a deal where I keep Vla, then war it is.

<p>
(ROLAND to WORLD): Besides me who else has read the Wheel of Time series from
which I quoted last time? Best fantasy I've ever read.

<p>
(TO WHOEVER ASKED IN A <b>REAL</b> LETTER): You can get 
<i>NoSeWeGe</i> by offering to standby in the game, offering to standby gm, 
or writing press or other silliness, just like Don...doesn't...
<i>((As Ghod and his handyman the Toadfather is my witness, ``I'll never
rely on the Duck to write press again!''
Anyone, please, anyone, take over writing press in Arsenic and Old Farts
for the Duck.
We promise we'll wipe him out of the game as quickly as we can!!))</i>

Central Europe.

<p>
(VOCAB GUY to SD):  Aaaaaaank! on the bitter end thing.  It's nautical; old
anchors on sailing ships were held by ropes, not chains.  The end of the
rope nearest the anchor was exposed to seawater every time the
anchor was dropped, and so was generally in worse condition than
was ``the better end," the one farthest from the anchor, which rarely got
into the water.  When a particularly violent storm came, mariners often
dropped the anchor and rode out the storm ``to the better end" of the
rope.  This term eventually got corrupted into ``the bitter end."  Sorry; no
frequent flyer miles for you.

<p>
(BARNO to ELLIS): Common roadkill varieties in Tioga and Tompkins
counties, where I commute 20 miles to work: Whitetail deer, 
raccoon, gray squirrel, woodchuck, dog, cat.
A coworker hit a coyote last month, although they've been scarce here
for generations.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to MY FELLOW AMBASSADORS): Greetings gentlemen.
I have just returned from a wonderful vacation and I must say that
a refreshing experience!
I only recently went over the state of affairs with Admiral Langworthy
and I have a few things to say.
First, Ambassador Dwyer.
Even though we still are technically in a state of war and the French
are still Britain's enemy of choice, you are to be commended!
Your actions are dispelling all doubt in my mind as to the efforts
and directions of this Great World War.
Please keep up the good work!
Ambassador Emmert.
Do be careful ole chap.
We need you and your Army.
By the way, I do agree with you concerning Mr. Barno, but remember
a picture speaks a thousand words.
Ambassador Ellis.
You will be pleased to hear that Baron Von Steuben is here in New
Carthage with me!
Even now he undergoes an alcohol rehabilitation program which I'm
sure will bring him back to Austria, fighting on.
To Ambassador Sherwood.  Your butler mentioned ``Prestige'', I
would like to mention ``Respect''.
I, for one, have this for all the men participating.
As I have said, Britain is at war with France, yet I just
received a letter from the man who has conquered my Nation.
I respect that gesture.... 

<p>
(VB to SD): The on-line filing thing was fine.  The pain in the butt was
having to enter all that stuff from all those W-2's (Sondra has lots).  That
part took far longer than the old method (tear off and staple - which I
had to do later, anyway!).  Got the refund within about 2 weeks, which
is certainly a new record.  Grudging thanks; if I can ever do you a legal
favor, let me know.

<p>
(SECRET PRESS FROM EMMERT to EVERYONE BUT SHERWOOD): Just wait 'til he
takes me up on this offer.  I'll fix his wagon big time.  ``Ooops, sorry,
Keith, I guess we missed the statute of limitations on this one.  Well,
maybe the next time you get hit by a bus, we can sue on time."  Heh,
heh, heh!)

<p>
(RUSSIA): Re my diplomatic efforts: Just trying to keep in the spirit of
the game's name!

<p>
(A MAN FROM EDINBURGH): It was 'orrible, 'orrible!
They was havin' a gay time of it.
One hand on a bottle of vodka and the other stuffin' haggis down their
throats and then the bombs fell!
Men scattered like sheep to the slaughter.
I jumped under the table just in time.
The roof caved in and when I crawled out I could see the Frogs sailin' 
in and blowin' the bloody crap out of the Cossacks!
Men were vomiting and heads were flyin'!
I even saw a Russian sailor jump under an old woman, but she hit 'im
hard with her shears and ran off to continue cuttin' the wool off of
her sheep!
It was over quick.
Poor bastards.
Didn't have a chance....

<p>
(PARIS): Reports came in early Monday that the mysterious Russian
``Lost Fleet,'' truly is lost and has perhaps vanished.
Many sailors reported that she was floating along and they just
lost sight of her.
There are theories that the Loch Ness monster swallowed
her up, but that is pure speculation.
Nevertheless, strategizers in Paris were both elated and
surprised to see that a once major problem was now off their hands.
<i>((I'm not sure it helps you as much as you thought....))</i>
One such person was quoted as saying, ``Now that we have eliminated
that problem, we can concentrate on the Scandinavian Peninsula.''
<i>((Which is precisely what rebuilding the fleet on the north
coast protects for him...))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to KENT): Look!
In Fall 1909 you could have a useful role to play!
These clouding eyes have seen more novelties than a deckhand has
crabs, yet such as this they have not peered upon since von Steuben
was a virgin.

<p>
(SAN DIEGO): No to all draws. Concede or die.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is STILL
missing... someone find him!).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!
Although press in this szine is generally black, I will make the
exception here that I will say who has NPRed and is ``at risk''
for being dropped. 
It's all Williams' fault.
The Duck's army will not move in the Spring unless its orders are
accompanied by press.
Sending me ``cool cards'' with the play that shall not be named on it
does not count!

<p>
3) That FET draw is proposed for your consideration.
Please vote with your Spring orders.
Failure to vote vetoes the proposal.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
  
(CON): now here's an earth-shattering build.

<p>
(CON-SEV): Hey puppet, that's not the tune I requested!
<i>((Don's been positively feisty lately, though no press!
Since you got press in this time, note what I did above...))</i>

<p>
(RUS-GER): My sincere sympathy goes out to you for being so shamelessly
abused by your supposed allies.  PS: Is it time to talk suiciding out yet?

<p>
(MPL-BOOB): Jim just wondering if you've heard the new Kristin
Hersh CD <i>Strange Angles</i>?  
I like it, though I thought <i>Hips and Makers</i> was better.

I didn't rush out to purchase the new one, though I'm sure I will eventually.))</i>

(MON-SEWER to SULTAN): Mon cher Stanley, can't you see it?  Is Kiel
standing tall in the ranks of supply centers?  Count em:  Ruhr, Hol,
Den, Hel, Bal.  Looks like five on my side.  Germany has Mun (cut)
and Ber (cut).  This one is wrapped up:  a sure thing.

(MIKE B to CHARLES J): Why, you ask, was I in a remote desert canyon?
Well, I was leaving Yellowstone after nearly five years.
Being in wilderness in my free time, and near wilderness the rest 
of the time, brought profound effects on me.
I'd visited Arches and Natural Bridges back in '95 and knew 
I wanted to see them and other places I'd missed.
I didn't know if I'd end up back East, and perhaps not get to see those
wondrous places for years.
So I spent three weeks hiking and driving, usually alone with my adopted
dog.
Met up with a friend (also leaving the Yellowstone area) for a few days
in Canyonlands.
Hardly anyone there in February.
Soul-cleansing.
	
(GERMANY-TURKEY): Okay, I appreciate your letter.  I will continue to
propose and vote for a 3-way draw and am glad that you have finally come to
some senses and will vote for it also.
	
(BLARNO-GERMANY): A bit paranoid, eh, or else a little short on the
creative side - a secret mission, maybe I like camping?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): I still would like to see Austria die.
Can it be arranged?	

<p>
(BARNEY-TURKEY): Are you in?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY AND AUSTRIA): I want a three way draw.
I will insist that both I (Germany) and Harold (France) are 
part of that draw.
This puts you both in a dilemma.
Harold has said that he will let me eat his centers until this issue is 
forced.
Time will tell.
Harold has done exactly what he has told me that he will do in all the
games that I've played with him (Which I believe has been three.
I can't find my game notes since I moved and I can't remember if it's
two or three.).
Anyway, this is the deal.
Austria, if you help me break the stalemate line that Turkey has now and 
move south you can have part.
Turkey, if you let me kill Austria you can have it.
	
(TURKEY-FRANCE): Why do you even play Dip if you don't like the intricacies
of mid/end games?  Do you believe in stabs?  Do you believe in changing
alliances?  Do you believe in negotiating?  Do you believe in fairy tales?
Do you believe in altering strategy after Winter 00?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): It's clear to me that this game can last forever.
<i>((It hasn't been going on ANYWHERE near forever yet.
Once a game gets to the mid-1920's then you can start talking like that,
but not yet.
For all of everyone's ``discussion'' about nothing happening, there 
hasn't been ANY game year where nothing has happened so far.))</i>
Jim isn't going to force the issue like it was always done in the
<i>Rebel</i> at this point in a game.
<i>((Nope, because those aren't my house rules on that issue.))</i>
Austria is probably not voting, and Turkey is probably voting No in
most cases.
So this is my best move.
Drop me a line if you want me to move back and I will.
I will move slowly and allow you to keep the MED sealed.
I will <i>not</i> kill you.
I'll eat only one or two centers at a time until the turkey,
playing Turkey, gets desperate and votes for a three way.

(JAMES to WORLD): My position is not as good as it might first appear.  
18 is not assured yet (although it might be after this season).
 
(GERMANY to FRANCE): You're in a very good position, but it seems a mite
early to be counting chickens.  We ain't dead yet.
    
(JAMES to STEVIE GUESSER): I don't think so!  I'm sending in my orders 
and builds by email, fax, phone, and pony express.  You don't really 
think that I would NMR now.  By the way, in my six years in the hobby 
I have never had a single NMR (or NBR).
     
(FRANCE to GERMANY): How about I let you have another Army in the West 
and you let me have one in the East?  Remember when your orders got 
messed up in Turkey and your file orders were used - it saved 
Turkey's neck and it just might save yours!
 
(GERMANY to AMERICA): Okay, right about now would be a good time for
you to intervene.  Think you can land on the Normandy beaches?

<p>
(JAMES to BOOB): It looks like Stevie is starting to grasp at straws.  
I might hand deliver my orders for the Fall in person - if all goes 
well, they will be my last.

<p>
(ANK-SER): Hey - Mike - wreak a little havoc on that darned Frenchman,
make things interesting for him, at least.
     
(FRANCE to RUSSIA): It looks like you will survive.  You are correct.  
I can't get you without an Army.  Come to think of it I am sort of 
glad.  What is amazing is that Austria will survive as well.

<p>
(JOHN BOY-BOOB): Everyone just sort of ignores ya when you're down to one.
No biting jabs from a single soul.
I'm feeling unappreciated.

<p>
(BOOB to JOHN BOY): I hope not from me!
You're very appreciated from me.
I can say that even though I've submitted moves to kick your butt in
Ann Arckey!!
We'll see if they work.
Keep writing great press and letters and I'll abuse you, even if no one
else will!
How dare you turn down my support to Piedmont!!!???

<p>
(AUSTRIA-GERMANY): McGwire won't hit 62 home runs this year because of
where he plays.  NO ONE could break Maris' record while playing half of 
their games at Busch stadium.
     
(GERMAN MUSINGS): Sondra and I went to see <i>Les Miserables</i> yesterday.  
I have always had some trepidation of seeing any screen adaptation of this, 
my favorite novel, since I've always feared resenting the unavoidable 
omission of this character or that event (the novel is 1200 pages, 
so there's no way to do it otherwise).  
But this is a wonderful presentation, beautifully
photographed and well-acted.  I think it compares favorably with my
favorite film version, a made-for-television movie from about 20 years
ago starring Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates does
Inspector Javert - talk about an easy character to despise!).  Now if I
can only persuade the same people to remake The Count of Monte Cristo,
I can be really happy.

<p>
Baseball is a mess.  Accordingly, if the powers that be can see their
way to making me commissioner for a while, I will make a few changes.

<p>
1.  There will no longer be interleague play.  The only times the Yankees
should play the Dodgers are in March in Florida or in the World Series in
October.

<p>
2.  The leagues will be divided into two equally-sized divisions.  At the
end of the regular season, the winners of the eastern divisions of each
league will play the winners of the western divisions.  The teams with
the second-best records in each division will each get early tee times. 
There should be no reward for finishing second in baseball.

<p>
3.  I guess I'll need a drug policy.  We'll publish and widely publicize a list
of banned substances.  For a first violation, a player will be suspended
for three years, and sent to a mandatory drug treatment program.  For a
second violation, there will be no program; just a mandatory eight-year
suspension.  Okay, the players' union will scream at me.  They want to
go on strike for the right to use illegal drugs and get away with it?  I'll take
my chances in the court of public opinion on this one.

<p>
4.  No designated hitter.  What's next - a designated fielder for a guy
who can't catch a cold?

<p>
5.  At least four of the World Series games will be scheduled to begin no
later than 3:00 pm eastern time.  This midnight nonsense is insane.

<p>
6.  Umpires will be directed to call the strike zone as it's written.  Right
now, it's like Eddie Gaedel is standing in for every hitter, and only Greg
Maddux can find where the zone is actually called.  I hear some people
complain that most hitters will never be able to catch up with some
chest-high fastballs.  If those people would kindly explain to me how Ted
Williams and Lou Gehrig could do it, but modern hitters can't, I'll be glad to
listen.

<p>
7.  Marge Schott will be sent to Sri Lanka with George Steinbrenner to do
a comprehensive twelve-year study to see if baseball can catch on
there.  I'll expect a report on my desk at 9:00 am, June 15, 2010.

<p>
8.  This is very, very hard for a Dodger fan to say, but the next Hall of
Fame ballot will include the name Peter Rose, unless I get proof that he
bet on games that he had the power to influence.

<p>
9.  For all the crybaby whiners now in the bigs (and not yet in the bigs,
including J. D. Drew), I will impose a tax of 85% of their lifetime earnings. 
The money will be used to go to the only sports figures who really
deserve that kind of money:  The hockey goalies.

<p>
There.  Now I feel better.  I figure I would last maybe thirty-six hours,
tops, before the owners gathered up the votes to fire me, but it would be
glorious while it lasts.  I will take the game from the corporate barons and
television moguls who run it now and give it back to the fans.  Please call
Bud and the boys and suggest my name for commissioner.  I don't ask
for a lot of money; the same as Giamatti got will be fine.  But I do insist on
the greatest perk of the office:  Front row seats to any major league
game you want to see.  Now that will be living.

<p>
(MORE BASEBALL MUSINGS): Well, actually it's Aaron.  
Today's <i>USA Today</i> has a comparison chart of
the ages at which Hank and McGwire reached various milestone HR's. 
McG just hit #400 at age 34.  Not bad.  But Hank got his FIVE hundredth at
34.  McG is a lock (barring injury) to reach 500, and should finish his
career with 600 (joining Hank, Babe and Willie).  But Aaron is probably
unreachable.  If McG has five more good years left in him, he'll have to
AVERAGE 71 a year to catch Aaron.  No dice.

<p>
Junior Griffey has a far better shot than McGwire.  I think he has 309 as
of this writing (294 coming into the season, and I think he hit #15 of the
year yesterday).  Aaron got #300 at age 29.  Junior will be 29 in
November.  If he hits 30 more this year, and, say, 45 more next season,
he'll have over 380 (half Aaron's career total) before he reaches his
thirties.  If he does a little better than that, he could reach 400 by the time
he's 29.  Barring injury, we're looking at the next guy to hit 700.

<p>
As for hitting .400, well, I love Gwynn; I think he's the best student of
hitting since Rod Carew.  But I don't think even diluted pitching will carry
him over .400 at this age.  Now, when the AL eventually expands to 16
teams, to match the NL, THEN we might see some guy with 20-15 vision
and quick wrists challenge Ted Williams.  When there are over 350
``major league" pitchers, some serious hitting records will fall.  That'll help
Junior, too.

<p>
I think all of the really unbreakable records in baseball are pitching
records.  Nobody will ever approach Cy Young's 511 wins, or Walter
Johnson's 113 shutouts, unless they change the rules of the game in a
way that drastically affects statistics.  But eventually, somebody will hit
a 756th homer, and the age of the .400 hitter will return, ushered in by a
thinned pitching pool.  Maybe somebody on the Rockies will drive in 191
runs, but for now, I think Hack Wilson is safe.

<p>
The record I want is shared by three guys at the turn of the century. 
(When I played, I was an outfielder.  I was a fair hitter, not very quick,
but I had the best arm on the team.  So I got to play a lot of right field and
threw out my share of guys going from first to third on singles.)  Most
assists in one game, outfield to home:  Three.  What I want to know is
what happened to the three third-base coaches who each sent three
guys to their deaths at the hands of the same guy.  Man, I want that
record.
