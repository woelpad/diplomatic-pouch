This issue was going to fix up the 23 Tunes game, but it is taking me forever.
I totally confused myself with the randomizing of the order of the submissions
to keep them secret.  I need to make myself a little table, but I've spent a
few hours organizing them already and it still isn't close to done.
Sorry, but I can't hold up the szine any more.
It has a few sets of orders in the games, 
rebirths Peter Sullivan's <i>Octopus' Garden</i>, and gives the second issue
of Doug Kent's subszine, as well as another Andy York production.  
In that sense, this quick hitter has more to read than you might have expected.
I didn't manage to get this out so you all could join Jamie McQuinn's NCAA basketball 
tournament Challenge group.
I am doing this just before the finals, as my two choices for the finals, UCLA
and Georgetown lost.  I should have gone with my first gut that Florida would
win it again. As I write, that's what I expect to happen tomorrow.
Ohio State, coming from a weak Big 10 conference, has continued to surprise me 
though, so maybe I am just totally wrong about them.
Billy Donovan is a wonderful coach and played the go-around just right with that
talented Florida squad.
Other than that, I'm an upset special kinda guy, so I am going to be at the bottom of
Jamie's group, as this was the most by the book tournament ever.
I think the reason (the only thing different) is the new NBA rule that has all the
top freshmen playing in college instead of the NBA.  
I think it is a good rule, even if it is unfair to the superstars, who make more money
if they go straight to the pros and obviously value the choice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We moved the deadlines back yet again to get me back on track.  I really think I should be.
As most of you know, I moved one of my offices in February and it was FAR more disruptive
to my whole life than I had anticipated.  I'm still not recovered, but I think the
szine can stay on schedule.
The worst part was finding the time to do the mailings, so for the THIRD time on this page,
I will remind you, SIGN up for E-Mail alerts and mailings if you're playing here.
If you're not on the list, it WILL hurt you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ERIC JUST - JEFF KEY IS FOUND!!!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Edi Birsan has found Jeff Key!
Thanks, Edi, and Edi is donating his $25 to a fund to get New England area
players to World DipCon, and I'm adding to it.
If you're here in New England and going to World DipCon this summer, apply to me!
And since Jeff mentions Eric Just, let's find him too!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<br /><br /><b>Jeff Key (Mar 23, 2007 10:33 AM)</b>   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,
Actually, I think I only played one face-to-face Diplomacy game in NYC.  I
remember meeting John Boardman there (weren't you there as well, Edi?).
Most of my face-to-face was in Oklahoma City and at various DipCons around
the country... Youngstown, Lake Geneva, Chicago, Dallas (I actually won that
one), etc...  The last face-to-face game that comes to mind would have been
in Oklahoma City about 1985.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Eric Just once published that the strongest weapon I had was my reputation
for honesty... that I could be counted on to keep the letter of any
agreement I made.  I always felt that reputation was what enabled me to play
the Lepanto Opening so many times so successfully.  I always got a kick out
of the expression on the Turkish player's face when he/she realized what was
happening.  That said, I still feel that Austria-Hungary was my favorite
position to play because I always felt that it was the most difficult.  I
cannot remember ever letting an Italian player try a Lepanto Opening with me
as A-H!

Jim,
My introduction to Diplomacy was, in fact, an accident.  In one scene of the movie 
"The Mouse that Roared," all the diplomats were sitting around outside the borders 
of Grand Fenwick waiting to get in and playing a board game called "Diplomacy."  
That looked interesting so when I saw the game that summer of 1959 at Foley's 
in Houston I immediately purchased it.  I was initially disappointed to find that 
it was a different game and required seven players.  Flash forward a bit.  
I was at Oklahoma City University and was able to introduce a group of my 
friends to the game.   We became regular players.  By 1967 that group had 
scattered to the four winds and I was in the Army.  Eric Just, one of the original 
members of the group, came up with the original idea (for us) of playing 
Diplomacy by mail... after all, there was no form of luck such as a die roll 
involved.  We ended up with several games in progress before we eventually made 
contact with mainstream postal Diplomacy.  The rest is history.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer, Doug Moore,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.
Actually, the Semifinal games began in October.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen anything on progress in these games,
and that's why.
More on that next issue!!!
Thomas Franke and David Partridge are in a game together that seems
on first glance to be the weakest in the rest of the players.
So my first thought is that one of those two will have a slot in
the finals.
I am getting raked over the coals for it, but I just ended a game
in a three way draw between me, Thomas, and Ray Setzer that I might
have had a chance in ekeing out a win mostly because Thomas asked
for it to end so he could focus on this semi-final.
Sorry, David, but I had to do it.....
Of course, after saying that, David Partridge is in England getting beaten
on by Guy Thomas in France, who is allied with Thomas Franke in Italy.
But Italy has a Juggernaut bearing down on him from Mike Tombu and
Julio Cardoza.
And Toby Harris just got crunched in his game where he is Turkey, but
I don't count him out yet, he has more lives than a cat!!
But never mind, I don't know how ANY of this will turn out!!!
Doug Moore is doing pretty well as Russia in his game so far, but
Russia can always be crunched after doing well early.
Buffalo is doing pretty well in his game as France taking down Germany
and now attacking Adam Silverman's England, I think, that part is still
developing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where some of this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
I had to go the main Worldmasters site at www.worldmasters.net/wm04/ to
find some of these results.
The new Tournament rankings for FTF also are out there that supercede the
ones that were on 18centres.
Go check out:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://eurodip.nuxit.net/php/ranking/index.php?lang=Ang

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It ranks 4792 FTF players and is the most complete known compilation of FTF play
ever in the hobby.
You really want to check it out.
Poor Eve Smith ends up 4791st, having been in 33 tournaments in the last ten years,
an achievement in itself!
And of course Don Del Grande is down near the bottom at 4787th, off of 13 tournaments,
two of them in Australia.
For having the Don Challenge Cup named after him, he didn't do THAT badly in his
tournaments Down Under, better than I'd been led to believe at 54/78 and 34/57
And Frank Johansen is a well deserved #1.
And I'm amazingly in the top quarter with a ranking of 1154, accurately reflecting
the nine tournaments that I know I've been to (i.e. I don't see any missing).
Yann Clouet (if I counted right) has been to 95 tournaments, I'd be surprised if
someone surpasses him in number, and he ranks 11th.
Guaranteed to be a fun browse....

<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
late.
Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number, scores are in parentheses) 
is, in alphabetical order, 
Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper (1), Dick Martin, Richard Smith (3), Joakim Spangberg, and Brad Wilson (4).
The linking theme thing didn't seem to go over too well.
No one really figured out the true linking theme.  
Rick Desper was using Underground tube stops and songs with that as the title,
they were things like that.  
I'll let you guys talk a bit to each other on that with your guesses.
I have added some kind of comment on each tune.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: two more tunes (seven if you're joining up new, four if you NTRed (NO TUNES
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.
This part is a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,
Syracuse was completely hosed by the NCAA committee.  It made absolutely no
sense to take Arkansas, Illinois, or Stanford over SU.  I think we clearly
got a glimpse at how politics works on the committee.  It wouldn't have
bothered me as much if the last spots were taken up by mid majors rather
than average teams from power conferences who had representation on the
committee, while the Big East had none.  I'm hoping that Georgetown wins the
championship and SU becomes the last team to have beaten them - and handily
at that.  To make matters worse, SU only received a 2 seed in the NIT and in
the South Region at that - West Virginia got a #1 seed over SU!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Well, to be fair, they did end up winning.
I think that was deserved, Beilein is turning into one of the game's great
coaches for that type of team.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clearly the NIT was figuring that Arkansas would be the #2 seed in the 
South and then just dropped SU into their spot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Good point, I think you're precisely right.  I guess the two committees
don't coordinate.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the bright side I was able to go to 2 additional home games that were
incredibly entertaining.  What a difference it makes when the fans in the
best seats are the most rabid fans - the ones willing to get on line early -
rather than the wealthiest fans.  A lot of fans called into radio shows and
said how they or their kids were able to see a game up close for the first
time ever from the first level of the Dome.  I enjoyed the fact that the NIT
games weren't commercialized.  Everything at the Carrier Dome is always
pre-programmed.  The same events - be it promotions, the dance team, or
whatever - happen at the same time outs in every game.  There was a lot of
negative publicity in Syracuse after the Notre Dame game (SU was totally
blown out) because the fans even booed the cheerleaders.   I hate it when
fans boo period, but a major contributing cause was that the cheerleaders
went on the floor to lead a cheer at a totally inappropriate time because
that was the pre-planned slot for that cheer.  The NIT games had no sponsors
or promotions and only cost $10 for adults and $5 for kids so lead one to
remember what college basketball was like before ESPN.  So, yes, I enjoy the
NIT games but I hope it is a long time before I have the chance to go again.

<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Mon, 2 Apr 2007 14:01:07 -0400 (EDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, it's time for the annual ritual where Jim, Dave and I all pick
the Red Sox to do spectacularly well this season, while Goz laughs
at our deluded optimism.  But hey, we've been right at least once
in the past thirty years, which isn't so bad, is it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, let's look at this division by division:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:
Yankees have monstruous hitting, even though ARod and Jeter are having
a spat, and bringing Pettitte back should help the pitching somewhat.
OTOH, they've lost Randy Johnson and Wang won't be as lucky this
season as he was last year.  (His stats were horrible for a 19-game
winner.)  The question with the Yankees in recent years has been
their age.  They are pretty much using the same cast of characters
that they did in 2000 (excepting Giambi and ARod), but most of them
aren't as good any more.   ARod has been exposed as a postseason
liability, and Giambi is only really scary when he's on the juice.
And Sheffield is gone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree with all this and think they will hugely miss Sheffield for the
balance he offers.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile, the Red Sox have picked up the hottest young pitcher in
baseball in Dice-K.  I'm thinking that, at the end of the day, Matsuzaka
will be a legitimate ace at the Santana/old Pedro level.  In addition
they'll have Schilling and Beckett, and we can hope both pitch better
this season than last.  At least with Beckett that seems like a
reasonable proposition.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Dice-K has an Ace mentality, which is half the battle.  No starter on
the Yankees now has that mentality, the Blue Jays have more of that now
than they do - Halladay.  I think Beckett is going to have a monster season
too.  And I think Julian Tavares will surprise people by being the best
fifth starter in the league.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rather than try to predict the finish, I'll put both of them in the playoffs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Blue Jays have one tremendous starter in Halladay, a good starter
in Burnett who gets injured too much, and a good deal of hitting, but
I'm still not scared of them.  (Except they seem to have a habit of
knocking Red Sox pitching around.)  The Os and Devil Rays will be also-rans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think the Yankees will take the big third place fall this year.
Boston, Toronto, New York, Baltimore, Tampa Bay.
This is not wishful thinking, I really think their pitching will be
another order of magnitude worse this year, and it is even possible that
they'll burn out Mariano Rivera and that would be certain death.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:
Word is that this is the loaded division.  I'm still going to take a
Show-Me attitude towards the Indians, though.  Writers have loved them
in the past two offseasons, but they haven't done much.  The White Sox
are a bit concerned because Jose Contreras and Freddy Garcia regressed
a bit in the direction of their historical levels of mediocrity, after
being lights-out pitchers in 2005.  The Twins have the best pitcher in
baseball and a great closer, and a good deal of hitting, but I'm going
to go with the young arms of the Tigers here. Let's pencil them in for
the playoffs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think Detroit will be helped immensely by Sheffield as the Yankees
suffer from losing him.  Most of the rest of this I agree with, Detroit,
Minnesota, Chicago, Cleveland, and poor Kansas City.  I don't think
the second place team here makes the playoffs, I think the other team
will come from the West.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:
Going to ride with the Angels again.  I'll look great until the As
make their annual September run.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think Texas will be in there too.  But I see the Angels and A's both
making the playoffs, probably Angels first, then Texas and Seattle.
It will take a while to get adjusted, but Piazza will be a steal, and the
A's STILL have the best rotation in the division.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:
Mets, Mets, Mets.  They were the only team in the NL to win more than
90 games last year, and they won 97.  I'll just pick them out of
inertia, presupposing they won't fall off very much.  Sure Pedro's
a year older, but Glavine is still pitching decently and they have a
ton of hitting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Pedro will not do much this year, but might in the playoffs.
The Mets are a bit of the leader by default, I don't think they have
that good a team, but there aren't any stunning teams in the NL.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Curiously, the Braves seem to have stopped their run of success
completely.  I don't quite get what the ownership's plan is, but they
are not stacking up the talent like they used to.  Phillies are a popular
Wildcard pick, but I'll defer that question for the moment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Mets first, but I disagree with you, Atlanta will finish second and
capture the Wild Card.  I think the Phillies, Washington, and Florida
will be bring up the rear in any order, probably the Phillies third,
but not sure.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: I'll go with the Cardinals.  They had a weird season
last year, as a number of their starters completely fell apart in
midseason.  But when they replaced them for the postseason, the
talent showed.  I'll pick them to win the division again, and with
more wins than last season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Cardinals for sure, lots of questions after that, very close, no
one except Pittsburgh is way out of it.
This "large division" is so hard to pick the exact finish.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: I'll go with the Dodgers again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Dodgers will win, Giants will be second, Padres third, Diamondbacks
fourth, and Colorado fifth.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, that's a bit lame, having picked all the NL division winners
of last season to repeat.  I guess that means I'll have to pick the
Padres to miss the playoffs.  Well, I don't want to pick the Phillies
because they've been predictable in recent years in underperforming.
So I'll take the Marlins and their young Red Sox cast-offs to be the
Wild Card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree that the Marlins might be good, but I really think Atlanta
will surprise.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Sox over Angels  <i>((Sure))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tigers over Yankees  <i>((Tigers over Toronto))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Marlins over Cardinals  <i>((Atlanta over Cardinals))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets over Dodgers  <i>((Sure))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
LCS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Sox over Tigers  <i>((Yes!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Marlins over Mets    <i>((Mets over Marlins))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Sox over Marlins  <i>((Red Sox avenging 1986.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wow, I have to say I'm as surprised as anybody else that I
picked the Red Sox to win the World Series.  But keep this in mind:
last year I picked the Cardinals at this point, and I was right!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But it'll really suck if Hanley Ramirez is the World Series MVP.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Spring 1902's deadline is delayed to April 21st to be sure everyone is on board.
We have one anonymous press item to fill the time.
I actually had all the sets of orders but one
(you should know who you are!!!), but at least one of the sets I had was questioning time to deadline, 
so I held it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that Jeff O'Donnell now has an E-Mail address.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS): 
Damn, this is tedious, I looked at the page I was on. 
"What good is a szine without risque stories, dubious plot themes, 
and full frontal nudity?"   
I was trying to remember what szine I was in, what the continuity was, 
or if I had paid this month's rent.  Way too many details, and I have 
always found that details can be; let's say "emulsified" with a little brandy.  
But the Cheater's was out, so it was time to head downstairs to McGillicutty's and freshen up.
"Okay, moving the theme forward can wait, at least long enough 
to grab a cold shower and a hot beer", so McGillicutty's it was.  
Simone was still out so I headed toward the door. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There was a rattling banging knock on the office door.  
I immediately knew that it was not a client.  Ah, the deductive mind.  
Often there is the tentative tap, of someone who is embarrassed to hire a private eye, 
or the imbroglio pound of a fist on the door of someone who is 
angry that they have to hire a private eye... or that their wife had. 
Even the ambivalent knock of someone who is passing the pizza menus from 
the local pie shop and doesn't really care if you get one or not.  
But no, this was Burgess's rattle, snap, knuckle that denoted that the 
rent was late and he had had enough.
I debated with ignoring the knock, but quite frankly that would leave us 
with half a page of knocking, escalating to pounding and me either 
cowering under the desk (not likely) or gazing out the window (boring).  
Either way, you "gentle reader" would be subjected to uninspired 
space-filling narrative.
I flung the door wide,  "Burgess, my goodness I've missed you. 
Where have you been keeping yourself?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'll have none of that," said the short, squat landlord, "You're late.  
You're incredibly late. Oh, Hell your deadline is past. 
It's come and gone. Long past. Much, much too late.   
I lease you a good eight paragraphs (excluding dialogue), 
I keep the margins crisp and the font clean.  
I expect you to pay your rent on time!"  
He pulled a folded over calendar from his waistcoat and waved 
it in front of my eyes.  I could see where the months had been "exed" out. 
I could see where he had erased his deadlines and written in newer, 
later ones, but nevertheless it was still clear I was behind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, one of my questions is answered…"  he looked perplexed... 
"I haven't paid my rent."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You're two issues behind!" he blurted.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Not to worry."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Not to worry!!??"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"No, I have a case!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You have a case?" he echoed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Are you going to repeat everything I say?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Dialog is not included in the rent... I'm helping you stretch it out."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I appreciate the contribution; but seriously, don't help me."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You said you had a case..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didn't have a case, but I could hardly see being evicted 
over a small technicality such as that, so I decided to "embellish".
"Yeah...it's a missing persons case." I said, pulling a cigar from my pocket.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wow, a missing persons case!"  (There's a reason he doesn't charge for dialog.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, yeah that's the ticket!  
A well to do family, a young girl asleep by a stream, 
a secluded location for a picnic, and "poof" she disappears... yeah, that's it."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"A young girl, or a young lad?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Whatever, I'm not into questioning lifestyles...  
I just know the family is concerned, and I have been retained.  
The rent cannot be far away," I lit the cigar, 
pulling to get the ember going.  I knew I had him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, it sounds most urgent.  I won't stand in your way.  
I assume I can count on your rent."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Oh, certainly.  
You'll have it by Issue 310, I promise. 311 at the latest, or my name isn't...

(CONSTANTINOPLE (DEC 31, 1905)): Sultan Hatas I surveyed the

what can he possibly gain by this perfidy?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to STAR TREK FANS): In a MAJOR boon to me getting this issue out, Star Trek Press is now
submitted on line, rather than postally, so I don't have to type it in.
In the translation, the Federation computer seems to have lost its capital key.
No problem. 
We'll just Mark Lew/Dick Martinize it with lower case all the way....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS, 7 OF 9'S LOG): down but not out! 
"i thought it was over so much so that i had made calculations to escape 
to my last reality with captain kirk. things are still pretty bleak here. 
earth and mars are occupied by the cardassians and vulcan is under siege. 
on top of that i've been forced to decommission a troop transport. 
on the other hand thru my diplomatic effort i have received help from 
of all people the grand negus (good thing he is not holding a grudge) 
and the andorians. together we managed to blow up a cardassian transport 
with the loss of all hands (die cardassian scum...) , 
defend vulcan (barley) and as a result of the battle one of our transports  
occupies a cardassian world called thesness 3. in addition,  
the andorians are occupieing cardassia prime. i don't know what 
makes gul dukat more nauseating, the fact that he can't be trusted 
or his bumbling incompetence. of course i can't talk after i ran 
the federation in this universe into the dirt but i can at least 
try to take down the cardassians with me, 7 out".......

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) We're pushing off to April 21 for spring deadline.
Also, I looked at Matt's order of FLEET Berlin and wrote ARMY Berlin.
Sorry about that, this is corrected here.
Then I had saved the file as Sundstrom.309 instead of sundstrom.309 and that made it 
initially difficult to re-find.
Sorry, Matt!!!

(BOOB to WORLD): See item above on other Star Trek press....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS): "breathing room", a conversation: kirk K, spock S, and lt. uhura U,
spock on the bridge looking at his sensor monitor not believing his eyes...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S captain,this is curious, i can't pick up any sign of the romulans in the neutral zone. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K is it possible that our tachion scans are no longer effective at detecting a cloaked ship?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S i don't think so. we can still detect 3 birds of prey in the andorian neutral zone 
although we have no idea as to there exact location or destination. 
they are there. also they have abandoned deep space 2. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K what do you make of it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S it can mean only one thing captain. our gorn allies have put up a briiliant fight 
but they are losing badly to the tomarians. also the tomarians have  
2 galaxy class starships 3 light years from mars and deep space one. 
they are no longer needed to defeat the gorn. the romulans are either very stupid 
or they have made a deal with the tomarians and as you know captain the romulans are 
many things but stupid isn't one of them. they have fought us too hard to just quit  
(suddenly lt. uhura's station starts beeping, kirk and spock look at the lieutenant)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U captain i'm getting a message from commander worf from his hiding place in exile 
on the planet grafton.
he's sending us data for a new and improved communications array and tactical 
suggestions as how to deal best with the romulan/tomarian threat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S fascinating, apparently mr. worf has been monitoring our situation to kill time during his exile.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K any chance the data will help?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S the array will probably help us to communicate more efficiently with everyone 
and may even help us talk to Q.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K why would we want to? 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S good point. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Maybe Kirk and Spock don't want to, but ***I*** might want them to, 
so says Q.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K maybe his tactical ideas will help.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S they better because as it stands right now the tomarians are projected to 
take over this universe and if what's left of the gorn are forced to join them then...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K we better learn to speak tomarian!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S considering that their language is not comprehendable by the universal 
translator i'd say that's not likely.
(as the bad trek music starts playing kirk and spock just sit there contemplating)
