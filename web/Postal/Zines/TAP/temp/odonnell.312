jim; i just sent you my star trek press for spirals and flip flop.  i forgot to put my name on it. im guessing you knew it was from me but i figured i should let you know anyway.
yt/jeff odonnell
ps
sean withdrew from the new modern game because he beleives that some of the players object to me and sean in the same game. he is thinking that is why you have been unable to get the game going and   he did say that he would be willing to play if you needed him for a 10th guy or a stand by if the other players did not object...

star trek press;  captains log," i think i am going to go comletely insane. WE HAD EM!  the romulans were completly surrounded.  we attacked and the romulans saw it comming.  they  used a multyphasic sheild to withdraw a troop transport then they used a galaxy class bird of prey to transport them to andorian deep space 2.   there attack destroyed an andorian troop transport killing everyone on boarrd.  the romulans are now in position to do serious damage to andorian forces.  to make matters worse our  long range scensors have detected 2 tomari star ships heading this way.  we cannot allow the romulans and the tomarians to link up.    we can still win this war  but we and our allies are running out of time,  kirk out".

jeff to carl; nice move! [bastard!]
france to england; why won't you just DIE!

spirals game press
star trek press; 7 of 9s log, "im confused! things are looking up for the beleagerd federation.  with the help of our andorian and ferengie allies we have conquored all 3 of the cardasian home worlds including cardasia prime and we are in position to take space station tarok floore. cardasia still controls earth and mars and thats where the confusing part comes in. gul dukat in his infinite wisdom has moved his remaining forces away from vulkan, our last federation home world. since we dont have to defend it we can concentrate on our kardasian campaine and then we can start our plans to retake the federation.  im also worried about our packlett allies.  having conquored the romulans with the help of the ferengie they had the romulans comletly surrounded at there last deep space base.  instead of finishing them of they withdrew and now are in no position to take the base.  no offence to idiot  federation morality but we are at war.  the only good romulan is a dead romulan. 
 i have to ask myself wheather the packlett commander is the care bear of the century or if he has a alterior motive in keeping the romulan empire still afloat.  im suggesting that my ferengie allies watch there back. 7 out".
