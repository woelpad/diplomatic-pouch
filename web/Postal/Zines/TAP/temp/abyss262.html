<i>Deny Everything</i> did end up making it into last issue of course.
In this issue find another ballot for the 2002 Hobby Awards, 
please vote by September 1!!
I really want to get Rip Gooch's subszine going, but he needs to hear from some
Railway Rivals players!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.

<p>
<br /><br />Yes, we have another hobby obituary to report.  
This issue it is another of our Colonia players, Gene Prosnitz.
Gene passed away peacefully in his sleep recently, after struggling
against brain cancer for most of this year.
Gene kept hoping against hope that he would be able to return to the
Colonia game, talking about it often, but of course in the end that
didn't really matter.
The players have called a draw and ended the game here.
This was not my most pleasant game in terms of mortality, with three
players dying in the last year.
Gene and his wife Sandy were avid game players of all types and they
were excellent bridge partners.
I've offered Sandy my condolences.
I'll miss Gene a lot.
I hope that's it and that all of you are EXCEEDINGLY healthy and happy!
Other than all this, I am.

<p>
<br /><br />I decided to can the sub price increase, the postal rate increase
really is peanuts, or it seems so at the 3-5 ounce level that I live it.
So, no problem, let's keep selling subs when I can at this price.
You all know that I'm an incredible softie anyway.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.

sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest

You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.

Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the

He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that

Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl

Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals Underway!!

<p>
This is possibly the most prestigious and hard fought E-Mail
tournament around (only challenged by Doug Massey's Vermont
Group Tournaments or the Australian E-Mail Tournament), now
with FOUR full rounds.
The final players (with current SC standing, which is what
counts in a C-Diplo based tournament) are:

<p>
AUSTRIA: Jack Brawner - Find Jack at TrojanOwl of aol.com,
and he back down to 5 centers at the end of 1906, after
Turkey stormed back into the game.

<p>
ENGLAND: Mike Weinzimer - Find Mike at mweinzimer of yahoo.com, 
and he is down to 2 home centers at the end of 1906, 
losing London, and is in even more trouble.

<p>
FRANCE: Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu - Find Joe at janbu of online.no,
and he is now up to 8 centers at the end of 1906, and is still
laying low, but is starting to crunch England.

<p>
GERMANY: Douglas Vaughan - Find Douglas at vaughan4 of mindspring.com,
and he is holding at 6 centers at the end of 1906, and I'm not entirely
sure what he is up to.

<p>
ITALY: Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira - You can find Egg at egbert of salavip.com.br,
and he is continuing to get crunched with only 1 center left at the end of 1906,
congratulations to the Brazilian World Cup team for its victory, perhaps
that will make Egg feel better as he heads toward elimination.

<p>
RUSSIA: Darren Koch - You can find the Aussie Darren at koch_family of bigpond.com,
and he is storming up to 7 centers at the end of 1906, after a slow start,
but he just has ONE fleet in the Norwegian Sea and it isn't clear what he
is going to be able to do with that.

<p>
TURKEY: Frank Johansen - Find Frank at frank.johansen of diplomacy.no,
and he is back up to 5 centers at the end of 1906, following his disasterous NMR
with a big comeback.

<p>
The wondrous Peter Richardson pjrich of ntlworld.com is the GM.

<p>
 The history of the WorldMasters tournament is that it is not necessarily
THE best player who wins, but the format and style seem to reward effort.
The player who works the hardest likely will win.  
Jack, Joe, and Douglas all look good at this point, with Egg and Mike
struggling to survive.
I know lots of you can't stand C-Diplo, but that's the way it works....
I think the game goes until 1912, so there is lots more play in it, though
France looks quite strong.

Subject: Manorcon Team Diplomacy

<p>
Hi Jim,
Can't resist on updating you on the results of the Team Diplomacy at 
Manorcon, just in case Toby Harris ``forgot" to.  I notice when looking at 
the favourites he didn't mention last year's runners-up, those seven 
no-hopers from Oxford, comprising no stars or anyone you would have heard of 
(with the honourable exception of Mark Stretch), just seven players who all 
attended the Oxford University Diplomacy Society at one time or another, who 
were licked into to shape, put through their paces and allocated countries 
by their non-playing captain (me).  Well, blow me if we didn't go and WIN 
the damn thing - and win it by a very substantial margin, what's more.  I 
wish I'd played now!

<p>
Toby, the team will be changing its name next year to ``Last Year's 
Winner"...

<p>
<i>((Well, you might have seen (if you looked at the web
version of <b>TAP</b>) that Toby was bragging a bit prior to the event.
I remember the Oxford group well from last year.
In fact, you might recall that until the ``seventh'' showed up at the
last minute I almost was the ``extra player" for that team. 
It WAS of course easier with the stupendous ``battle" going on between
Toby's team and Vic Hall's team for someone to walk off with
the crown..... 
Good for the team, did you win at Croquet again?))</i>

<p>
I did see Toby's gloat in TAP, hence my reply.
Yup, I also retained the croquet trophy and so will be going for 3 in a row 
next year.  It's just as well I did OK in the Dip and the croquet as I 
played another 14 games and maanged just 2 wins and one joint win!

<p>
Subject: Manorcon Briefings

<p>
Dear Jimminy,
Many thanks for another humble offering of <i>the Abysmal Prince</i>. 
Princely as ever, and not quite so abysmal ;-)

<p>
So, Manorcon, no doubt you've heard the results? Niclas Perez won for the 
second year running and was greeted with many a ``wow, second year running 
Niclas, must be a record". Of course, one only need check the past results 
of Manorcon to see it was done before ('90 and '91). 
But you know me, not one to gloat about things like that .... much.
<i>((But congratulations to Niclas, too, he is an excellent player
too, if a bit less boastful....))</i>

<p>
Convention write-ups are always a biased affair. 
Biased towards the author's experiences no less. 
But if folk want to say their own piece then that's where 
the hobby's pretty good - you just pipe up and say it !

<p>
Manorcon started a little early for me, picking Niclus (I always thought 
this spelling of his name was better) up from Birmingham International 
on the Thursday. 
As our captain, he was after a pre-tournament beer and a chat about 
where to find our 7th player for what I have always believed is the 
best f.t.f. team tournament in the world. 
For my own sins, I hadn't planned to be there and it was my first Dip 
convention since WDC '01 - some 12 months prior. 
Niclas had his 7 players already sorted out in March - in the shape of 
Leif, Thomas Sebeyran, Twerg, Brian <i>((Dennehy))</i>, Cyrille <i>((Sevin))</i> and 
Yann <i>((Clouet))</i>. 
But with Thomas off to Peru to grab the Peruvian 
Diplomacy Championship trophies (phoo ... shows he can't hack the pace 
in the big game ;-) ) and Leif in hibernation, 
Niclas was two short and my previous ``reserve" status won a promotion. 

<p>
Three days prior to the tournament, the six of us that comprised our 
team had been badgering Vic, who became sorely tempted. 
but in the end he just could not face stabbing the mighty Simon `Button' 
and jumping ship. 
We knew he'd whimp out ;-) 
Rather than taking ``any old rubbish", my advice to Niclas was 
``wait - and select carefully". 
I cannot disclose some of the team's pre-tournament discussions 
for fear of insulting some folk more than they deserve, 
but to give the gist of it: 
several names were banded about and to each one, 
one of the other team members would give a very blunt 
(and sometimes amusingly rude) reason why we wouldn't want him on side. 
It was getting to the extremes like ``Nah, can't ask Emeric ... 
his dandruff might encourage his neighbours to stab him". 
And that was one of the more polite comments which I've 
only repeated because, to my surprise at the tournament, 
he has obviously started using PH-balance Vosene ;-) 

<p>
Anyways, Niclas did wait for our 7th, and it proved to be a good move.

<p>
On the friday we picked up the two Irish boys <i>((Brian and Twerg))</i>
from the airport and made our way to .... to .... to .... to the pub of course !!!
There are some hip bars by the canal in Brindley Place 
(centre of birmingham) where we were later joined by two more 
Irish guys and the Guinness started to fly. 

<p>
And then on to the convention itself, where we were greeted by the usual 
array of crumb-filled beards, sweaty armpits, beer-bellies 
(peeking out from below an undersized T-shirt) and, of course, 
the scantily covered arse-cleavages which where in their usual 
high abundance this year: visible as their owners lean over their 
gaming tables to take their turns at whatever game they're playing. 
<i>((I love it!!!))</i>

<p>
Yup, it was another Manorcon, another weekend in the `trendiest' place around (sigh).

<p>
Whilst registering, I offered Niclas the best tip any Manorcon captain 
could ever get (when they are a player or two short) .... 
``look at the registration desk". 
For there, for all to see, were well in excess of 50 name badges of 
folk yet to arrive. 
Sure, it contained known 18XX players, non-dippers and total patsies. 
But, if you play the numbers game, you would think that from 50 or so names, 
you might be able to find one piece of wheat amongst the rather low quality chaff. 
Niclas watched as I picked each badge up and tossed it aside in turn, 
muttering ``chaff, chaff, chaff, chaff, chaff, chaff, chaff, ....". 
Steam train Toby, I thought! 
But eventually ... ``ahhhh, WHEEEEEEEEAT !!!". 
In fact, the only darned bit of wheat in the whole pile! 
It read: ``Paul Cook".

<p>
Paul Cook? Who's he? You well might ask. 
<i>((Yes, who's he??))</i>
To most he is completely unknown. 
In fact, to most English players he is completely unknown!!! 
Paul used to play in the mid-late eighties for the Ode team, 
and only ever played Dip at manorcon 
(as opposed to the various other tournaments going) and then only 
played the one round - the team round. 
So he never won a tournament. 
But year after year he got 14 centres with reliability like clockwork. 
Having been there to see it (though I never actually played him), 
I had a favourable eye on him as a team member for many years afterwards. 
But he retired from Dip in 1991, along with his close friend Pete Mason 
(slightly better known because he was UK National Champion in 1990). 

<p>
It all changed in 1997 when I finally persuaded Pete to join our team 
after 6 years out of the frey and, with him, followed Paul Cook for his 
one and only Dip game between 1991 and, well, Manorcon 2002. 
At that tournament ('97), Vic and I had formed our own teams and we 
made up our 7th by each picking one of the two star frenchies to 
play at Manorcon that year: Vic plumped for Cyrille 
(well, he had just been crowned world champ ... for the first of his two times !) 
whilst I was more than happy with '94 WDC winner Pascal. 
Vic's Cyrille played Germany to my Paul's Turkey and it was one 
hell of a game to watch. the pair of them rocketed ahead and, one year 
from game-end, it was clear they would equally top the board well 
ahead of the other five lame horses on that board. 
As captain I gave Paul some advice (as is perfectly within 
the rules of this tournament ... foreign players please note). 
``Sacrifice a centre to France, the Oxford player. 
Oxford are doing really badly. In so doing you can ensure he uses 
it to build correctly and will end up taking two centres from Cyrille". 
Paul complied. the net result that instead of equal 1st, Paul came 
(as planned) 2nd. 
The Oxford player topped the board and Cyrille came 3rd. 
At first this sounds a bit silly, but in respect to the team tournament 
it widened our gap on our closest rivals and we went on to win the 
team tournament for the third consecutive year ... a record for 
which no other team has ever managed to successfully defend a title, 
let alone go on for a third year. Cyrille was miffed but later understood. 

<p>
So, imagine Cyrille's delight when we announced our 7th team member ;-) 
Yup, after just `that' one game in 11 years, Paul Cook was our man. 
``A most worthy 7th player", Cyrille smirked. 
Once Cyrille had explained his last experience of Paul to the rest of the 
team, they too offered him their welcome and lost their nerves over 
the initial thoughts of ``has Toby gone mad ... who the hell is this guy?"

<p>
After agreeing to meet us at 8.30 the next morning for the team round, 
Paul went off to play other ganmes whilst the rest of us signed up for 
the Friday night individual game - the first of the tournament.

<p>
`` .... .... ..... .... Board X .... Toby Harris Austria .... 
Simon Bouton Italy ...."

<p>
Awe, bloody hell ! Now don't get me wrong, 
I aint scared of some previous WDC-winning numpty: they're ten a penny ;-) 
It's not that at all. It's just that, well, every game that Simon 
and I have played in for the last 13 years has had him lie to me 
pretty much every season. 
<i>((Yeah, and why might that be??))</i>
The pinnacle of his ``anti-Toby" campaign came in Sweden where 
he was Turkey and I was England. 
Each season he spent every moment available in the Dip period grabbing 
Russia, Germany and France together telling them their 
best course of action against me. 
Simon ain't happy unless I'm out of every game he plays in.
So Germany (bless the folly of this numpty - I'm sure one day he'll 
learn the game) opens to Tyr and then supports Simon into Trieste. 
<i>((Hasn't he ever heard of the importance of Austria/Germany Anschluss
alliances??  
I know you know this, but allow me to quote from the Diplomacy AtoZ on the
Anschluss....Richard Sharp's strategic 
notion that Germany should, in the early game, strive to keep Austria strong 
to reduce both powers' vulnerability as central (and surrounded) powers. 
Although they take their name from the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany 
in March 1938, Anschluss alliances are generally regarded as essentially 
pro-Austrian, with Germany using diplomatic leverage to discourage other 
powers - in particular Russia (with the threat of standing him out of 
Sweden in 1901) - from attacking his ally.  Tactically it entails 
F(Kie)-Den and A(Mun)H or standoff in Bur or Tyr, or even entering Tyr, 
and Italy is told that this unit will aid Austria if Italy attacks.
The advantage for Germany is that it is statistically provable that the
latter power is far less likely to win if Austria is eliminated early in the
game.))</i>

<p>
Of course, Germany was eliminated by F/E around the same time 
as I bit the dust, but that don't matter to him. 
``Hurrah, I beat Toby Harris", I believe was his view of the game. 
Er, yes, um, well, I think any player can ``beat" another player 
if you put it like that. 
It don't take too much to screw someone over if you're their neighbour, 
but I guess the skill comes when you go on to win yourself. 

<p>
A bit miffed, I grabbed a couple of other eliminees (it was about 
10pm) - Brian Dennehy and Cyrille (how the mighty fall ;-) ) 
and took them to a nightclub in town. 
Not some rave joint with teenage busty blondes bouncing their 
wares up and down, but just some laid back, armchair place with 
soft jazz music to accompany Brian's choice of a round for 
all .... .... ... Vodka Jellies! Nice one Brian ;-)

<p>
Getting back to the con and picking up Yann and Niclas after the 
round had finished, we headed back to mine with the two 
frenchies sound asleep in the back of the car and sleeping like babies. 
``ZZZZZzzzzzzznails, ZZZZZZZzzzzzznails ...." came from one and 
``ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzentres, ZZZZZZZzzzzzentres ....." from the other 
as they were both obviously each having a favourite dream. 

<p>
Next morning we were there bright and sharp for the team round. 
And, as is customary, half the teams there were ``great" / ``strong" / 
``in with a shout" / ``keep an eye our for them" / 
``one of the favourites" etc, whilst half of the teams 
were ``no hopers" / ``full o' chaff" / ``duff" / 
``6 numpties and another numpty" <i>((Hahahahah!))</i>
/ ``about as impressive as stumpy O'leg McNoleg's 
personal best in the Market Harborough marathon" etc. You get the gist.

<p>
You'll probably find these comments all the more amusing 
when you get to the results, but they were a genuine flavour of the time. 
The so-called top teams were, aside from Niclas' team of course:

<p>
Superzeroes (Simon Bouton, Demis Hassabis, Chetan, Gihan, 
John Colledge, Vic and one of their friends from the Magic club)

<p>
Fat Bastards (Mark Wightman, James Hardy, Simon Hornby, 
Dave Wreathall, Emeric, and two other fat sods)

<p>
The Cunning plan (Neil Duncan, Pete Mason, Andrew Greco, 
Richard Williams, Ivan Woodward and a couple of other folk of 
similar talent - s'cuse my memory)

<p>
The rest of the rabble comprised teams like Keith and Eve Smith's motley 
crew (usually last), a bunch of trophyless foreign players 
from various corners of Europe and of course, 
what Manorcon team tournament would be without them .... The Oxford Team.
Ah yes, Mark Stretch, Nicholas Parish, Dan Lester, Mark Sheiham, 
James Pinnion, Stephen Othen (absent this year) etc etc etc. 
These are the teenage boys who would, years ago, have been my 
favourite jibe as total no-hopers. 
In 1994 OxCon was born - a one-round dip tournament 
which appears at the end of January each year. 
And it's still going today. 
Usually gets 4-6 boards. 
1998 was my first outing to Oxcon and, on the way down in the car, 
I asked Vic ``so, you've been before, what's it like? Is there a bar?"
``Well, says Vic" (getting ready for a first-rate piss-take) 
they serve free drinks all day! But there's no beer - you get 
these little infant-school sized cups of lemon barley water". 
From that day forth, OxCon became well recognised as the 
tournament that had no beer but plenty of lemon barley water 
and the ``tough guy image" associated with the tournament 
followed the Oxford players at Manorcon ... and their results, 
typically lapping it up in 2nd or 3rd place each year. 
Second or third place from the BOTTOM that is ;-)

<p>
The team round started. Niclas was eliminated faster than, well, 
faster than you lost your home centres in WM9925 Jim ;-)
<i>((As fast as that, eh??  How could it be??))</i>
And from that moment on he did a superb job of playing 
captain and keeping us all posted. 

<p>
Manorcon scoring is not easy to calculate and the only real way to 
do it is to list the top 3 or 4 teams (by player and country) on a 
bit of paper and, against each name, put the current centre count 
and table position. It's pretty much gut-feel from there. 

<p>
By mid afternoon, the tournament had two clear leaders (though 
the other favourites were not a million miles behind); 
our team and The Fat Bastards.
I got elimiated for the second time in two games (never done 
that before at a con!) but we did have some other great 
table-topping results. Paul Cook only ended on 6 centres but when 
you consider Vic tried to shaft him right from the start, 
Paul did a superb job to get back into it and teach that 
cheeky little pixie a lesson by relieving him of his last centre! 
Poor Vic ... I guess he just wasn't mighty enough on this occasion ;-)

<p>
All results totted up (but results not yet announced) we figured that 
we should just pip the Fat Bastards and were way in front of the 
Superzeros and The Cunning Plan. Yippeee, the team trophies were 
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine all mine. 
Oups sorry, nearly got carried away there ... the trophies were 
ours, ours, ours, ours ours, all ours. 

<p>
And then the results were posted (team results are not 
``announced" as such until the end of the Sunday round - they 
just get posted on the board on the Saturday evening).
So, starting from the bottom: shock horror, not Keith and Eve's team. 
Indeed, Eve achieved her first ever table topping result 
over the weekend. 
<i>((Way to go, Eve, I knew she had it in her!!))</i>
All be it an equal top, but a top all the same. Nice one. 
Nope, the hobour went to some other bunch of losers. 
Reading up the list. Well well well, Superzeroes well 
down the stack. Nice one. 
The Cunning plan a bit further up - no real surprise, 
then the Fat Bastards. 
No shock there either - we were pretty confident. 
But then the surprises started to flood in. 
In third place was the team of foreign players 
(Michael Gutsen, Erland Janbu, William Attia etc). 
<i>((Joe and William are excellent players, I assure you, don't know who
else they had, but that wouldn't have surprised me!
William is one of the best board analysts I have ever seen.))</i>
Oups, we hadn't really considered them in our calculations, 
but what the hell, we beat 'em.
In second place .... oups, that was us. 
We thought we'd done it. 
Who else could have possibly beaten us? 
And then it hit us .... the Oxford Team! 
``There was one on my board and he did quite well" 
were the comments from the team. 
Indeed, Mark Sheiham came second on my board too. 
And, from memory, Vic Hall's nemesis, Mark Stretch, topped 
that board with our Paul Cook on it. 
Bloody hell, the barley-water-guzzling boys with bumfluff for 
beards from Oxford had done it !!! 
Indeed, they're not kids anymore. most are late twenties / 30-ish. 

<p>
It was hard to hold back the laughter. Y'know, 
I was absolutely thrilled for them Jim. Honest. 
Everyone likes surprises and I genuinely felt 
(and still do feel) that they deserved it and am 
pleased they each got a prize. 
Mark Wightman summed up the mood of the moment when Mark Stretch 
collected his trophy and was walking back the crowd, 
staring down at it with admiration. 
``Yes, it's a TROPHY Mark!!!" 
Possibly Mark Stretch's first ever, I don't know. 
Even so, it was great to see it. 
Vic was laughing afterwards about getting a good working-over from 
Stretchy too. 
And, in my game, Mark Sheiham was very pleasant throughout 
and made an enjoyable opponent. 
I think Dan Lester was a bit of a sour grape in his game - he 
seemed to be edging on the side of losing 
his temper a couple of times, but other than that they all played, 
well, like a nice bunch of guys. 
<i>((See, it can get you somewhere in this game.... sometimes!!))</i>

<p>
Yeah, I gots no prob with them taking the silverware back home. 
They deserved it. And very high entertainment value too, to see them win it. 

<p>
And that was that for my Manorcon this year. 
No Sunday game for me .... way too busy nursing a hangover from 
the night before where half the convention piled back to Sital 
and my new house to party. 
Sital has banned me from smoking in the house, 
except for my study .... so at one point, half the party 
was in that room having a cigarette. 
All I can say is that it was a good thing that Mark 
Wightman and Emeric were the only two of the seven 
``Fat Bastards" to attend because the room is quite small!

<p>
But, popping back to the con late Sunday afternoon to watch 
the results come in, I brought in a bag of left-over beers 
for those that were there the night before. 
They all seemed quite thirsty after a solid day's diploming ;-)

<p>
And that's that Jim. Another Manorcon, told in a way that you 
almost certainly won't hear elsewhere. 
Possibly even innaccurate in places but what the hell.
<i>((No, indeed, but much appreciated. 
It makes me chomp at the bit to get back there for World DipCon in 2004!
I'll be there, count on it!))</i>

<p>
So, onto other things. 
The EDC in Malmo this weekend and the Denver WDC next year. 
Can't go to EDC for what is now the fourth year running. 
<i>((Results on that follow below shortly...))</i>
Last time was '98 ... and I've still got the winners 
crown as a keepsake ;-) 
And Denver is now a no-go either. 
Sorry mate, can't do it. 
Sital and I were planning to come but we've recently learned that she's 
now in a delicate way and due to give birth early next year. 
Came sooner than we'd planned: she only came off the 
pill what could have only been a week or two before she conceived! 
(he says, shaking pelvis in a manner suggestive of high fertility ;-) )
<i>((We didn't even have to give you any encouragement, did we??))</i>

<p>
In fact, by my reckoning, that rules me out of the Dip scene now for 
the next two years. Manorcon 2004 and their 3rd WDC will be my 
next surefire tournament. 
And this time I'll not be going for two eliminations. 
Nope, I want the silverware for Best Italy, Germany and France, 
Captain of the Winning Team, Best Diplomat, Biggest Stabber, 
Golden Blade, Biggest Piss-head, Best 'Harris', 
The Tournament Directors Discretional Award for anything he deems worthy, 
and of course the big one ... Individual World Diplomacy Champ of 2004. 
<i>((I'll have to join Eve and Keith Smith's team and wipe up the floor
with you!!  Watch out!!))</i>

<p>
Ok, I'll start packing .... toothbrush, changes of clothes, mints, 
10 packs of fags, a sneaky bottle of spirit for 
when the bar's closed, a couple of spare pens, 
sunglasses and a great big sack to carry the prizes home in ;-)

<p>
See you then but not before. In the meantime, if you don't hear from me 
it's coz I'm focusing on family, work and life in general.

<p>
Please feel free to help us get the word out by distributing this note
to any and all Diplomacy email lists.

<p>
Effective immediately, the Portland PiggyBack Society has accepted the
resignation of founder and President Jeff Dwornicki. Piggyback is
grateful to Jeff for his excellent leadership and contribution to the
hobby in founding and growing our club.

<p>
As of your receipt of this announcement, Jerry (JT) Fest has been
appointed to serve as the new leader of the Portland PiggyBack Society,
along with a management team consisting of Edward Hawthorne and Matt
Shields. Any information or business that formerly would have been
directed to Jeff should now be directed to JT at
jtfest of piggybackdip.org. The first order of business is to formalize the
structure of the club with a written charter, and to continue planning
for our Dress Rehearsal Con in January 2003
<i>((For World DipCon in Denver!))</i>, Piggyback 2003, and
positioning our club to bid on a future DipCon and/or World DipCon.

<p>
Once again we would like to thank Jeff for all of his hard work, and we
all look forward to the opportunity to game with him at future PiggyBack
events and Diplomacy tournaments.

<p>

<i>((Thanks, Jerry, I appreciate your efforts.  I will publish your note
in <i>TAP</i> and urge people to think about going to your January 
Convention (I won't be able to make it but will finally get to meet you in 
Denver!).))</i>

<p>
PS You're welcome, Jim. I also look forward to meeting you in Denver. One request
about any 'urging' for our January con. It is intended to be a `dress rehearsal'
for players attending the WDC in Denver later. While we welcome traveling players
from outside of the Pacific Northwest, we are also asking folks not to attend the
con in January if it means that they wouldn't be able to attend our regular
PiggyBack con in April. They may, of course, attend both - but if it's a choice
between one or the other, we'd rather see them at our big con in April.
Andy Marshall and the Pitkissers are also going to run a DR con on the same weekend as
ours, though theirs will probably be more of a large house con than a
small Con-con. You might want to let people know about that option as
well, and if you are anywhere near the Pitkissers, you might want to talk
to Andy about attending.

<p>
<i>((I'll make that emphasis, I did understand what you were doing.  
In fact, I'll just reprint it!!
Hell, as someone who's never played Manus' system, but only studied it for
the past few years, I really NEED to go to your Piggy Pre-Lim.  But
I simply can't.
I don't have the detailed results from the World Boardgaming Championships
(i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;DonCon) in Baltimore Hunt Valley from recently, but I do want to
announce that Andy Marshall, Pitkisser extraordinarire, won and Boston's
own (by way of New Zealand) Melissa ``Pox" Nicholson pulled off SECOND.
Congratulations, Mel!

There's been a lot of discussion of scoring systems on various forums lately,
but let me go to Buz so he can advertise the ONLY FTF event where you

<br /><br /><b>Buz Eddy (Tue, 6 Aug 2002 12:24:34 EDT)</b>

<p>
I think I have the purest ``Kill more people get more points" system around at 
Dragonflight. Divide 60 points among the winners and that is it. I want play 
to be focused on that sole objective, so I have no awards for best country, 
no center counts, no survival, nothing that can be negotiated. 

<p>
I do have lots of prizes (actually a few classy plaques and trophies, and 
large box of Dollar store items that everyone get to pick from in order of 
finish. ) I do add class awards for best performance in NADF Rating groups, 
but those groupings are based on rating before the tournament so they too are 
(win, draw, or die) based awards.

<p>
Tie-breaking is also ot of control of players. (other than kill, kill, kill, 
control). I assign countries, and those achieving the same score are placed 
in order by having achieved it with the statistically more difficult 
countries. (From lastest NADF records).  

<p>
Melissa <i>((Nicholson, see above))</i> 
wrote she wanted to play in more US tournaments, so I jumped at the 
chance to extend her a special invitation. The non-northwest players so far 
are Edi Birsan (CA), Manus Hand (CO), Andy Bartalone (MD), AND your former

Jim Bob,
I just wanted to drop you a note saying that I had no idea Bob Acheson was
that sick, but mostly to say how much fun I had with him the few times I was
with him. His 18 hour drive to Vertigo games in the early 90's was classic.
I asked him why he came and he said ``For the beer". How can you not like a
guy like that? Plus his zine was a great read as Bob had his viewpoint on
just about everything. Anyone who refers to himself as ``The Canadian Dip
Deity" is going to be a great read and Bob was. I will miss his sense of
humor and his Canadian nationalism. I think we should all have beer in his
memory as I am sure Bob would have appreciated that, although I'm sure he
would complain it doesn't do him any good now.

<p>
I did go and see ``The Sum of All Fears" and it was a decent movie but
somewhat predictable in the end. Overall it was well done since the movie
didn't drag at all until near the very end. I liked the editing and the
direct, the acting was decent if a bit pedantic.

<p>
My Phillies are again in last place, hopefully this will mean we'll finally
clean house. We need some serious power hitting. Unfortunately I think there
will be a strike this year since the players won't have a contract and this
is their best time to strke. What do you think and how are the Red Soxes
doing?

<i>((Finally getting rid of that whiner, Scott Rolen, seems to me to be 
a step in the right direction.  I think Sammy Sosa is getting frustrated
by the no-winning Cubs attitude.
I'm still extremely hopeful about the Sox.  
Pedro has reinvented himself as a finesse strikeout pitcher, Derek Lowe
is brilliant, and we got ourselves a pretty decent new hitter in Cliff Floyd.
If we can hold our own for the rest of the month, there is no strike, and
they can beat up on the patsies they play in September, they'll be there.
Most likely as the wildcard with the AL West teams beating each other up,
but they'll be there.  
And last year showed that the two great starters can win it all.
I'm not predicting it, but I'm hopeful.
Thank you very much for the words about Bob Acheson, I was at that MadCon
too and he just wanted the beer.))</i>

<br /><br /> First off, I've been threatening for the last couple of issues to review
the stunning new Cornershop CD and it's time to make good on at least one promise.
Where we last picked up on this group, we were talking about four years ago
about the sad news that Cornershop had split. 
For such an anticommercial bunch of musicians, the stress generated 
by the worldwide success of the album <i>When I 
Was Born For The 7th Time</i>, and in particular the stupendous smash hit, ``Brimful 
Of Asha", practically ensured that frontman Tjinder Singh would decide to 
pack it in. 

<p>
But this would not last forever, as the media rush died down, Cornershop
began jammin' together again and I wouldn't have believed it, but they
have outdone themselves!
<i>Handcream For a Generation</i> (a spot rock on title) gives you a 60's
soul rock mixed with a bit of acid rock landing square in the middle of 2002.
Tjinder Singh draws favorable comparisons to Lou Reed (listen to ``Wogs Will Walk''
and yes that is REALLY the title of the song!)
and Bob Marley (listen to ``Motion the 11'')
and amazingly enough, the comparisons are apt.
The audacious ambitions of this record are hard to place but you know you're 
hearing something completely new that still celebrates the old.

<p>
It begins and ends with something called ``Heavy Soup", that I could hear three
or four times interspersed on the record. I haven't even come close to
losing the spontaneity in the grooves - even after many repeated listenings -
but it sounds like it could collapse in ruins at any moment.
The reggaeish ``Motion The 11" has these false starts that just enrapture you,
reminds me of the best of Throwing Muses!
The musicianship capabilities of the band also are finally matching their 
subtle songwriting.
The amateurish crap that sullied <i>Hold On It Hurts</i> (and believe me, that
record sometimes does HURT!) is completely gone!
They even have a hard rockin' single with the scary title of
``Lessons Learned from Rocky I to Rocky III".
It isn't the point of the song, but it reminded me of the roommate I had in 1980
or so who used to get up every morning about 6AM blasting the Rocky theme in
his room to psych himself up to go out for a run.
I soon began running early in the morning too - never with him though, and usually
striving to be out on the road before he awakened....
they currently are touring in Europe, darn it.

<p>
If I wrote a political album like this one is, I'd probably make it all sorts
of cynical and not just a little bit whiny.... hey you guys know, you read
the crap I write!
But Cornershop have a deep seated warmth and an amazing sense of humor. 
Charlotte hates the discoish ``The London Radar'' (and she is screaming about
it right now as I type) but hey it has a great beat and I can dance to it!
And then it passes into the ``Asha'' like bounciness of ``Spectral Mornings'',
perhaps my favorite song on the record.
But they still are releasing their music on their own Willja label, so
they are completely uninhibited by any desire to fit into any music 
industry marketing niche.

<p>
Sonically, the reach of the band's influences stretches for miles and
miles and miles, with an infectious cheekiness about it all that just
makes you smile.
But there's one big problem. If there's any justice, this album is going to 
be totally huge - worldwide. 
So, will Tjinder Singh and Cornershop run away and hide or will they
keep making more music? 
I don't know but until then, this is the best record I've heard this 
century so far..... a few more pithy comments on each track, just
to show you a tiny bit of that range and how great each track is....

<p>
1. ``Heavy Soup'' (The Intro): this is the soundcheck that also 
is the essential beginning. 
So, start off with some soul, why not grab the legendary Otis Clay, 
recorded specially in New York City, with some scratches by the
ubiquitous (on this record) Rob Swift.
I just don't get it... ``Daddy, that crew swings like a gate". 
The gate gives you slices of the melodies that you will 
soon be hearing on this album.  It's so obvious, but I've never heard
anything like it before.

<p>
2. ``Staging The Plaguing Of The Raised Platform'': Great pop song!!!
It sails in with a completely joyous ``Brimful of Asha'' type of 
rhythm, but it is a better dance tune.
If justice has anything to say, this will be one of the top radio hits
of the year, justice is silent more than it speaks these days, so that
probably won't happen, but it should.
The chorus, that repeats the song title, brings in a mini-chorus of 
children (six of them listed on the CD) that is just delightful.
I love JUST the right amount of cello in a great pop song, and Penny Holt
delivers just that amount, without falling over into the saccharine.

<p>
3. ``Music Plus 1'': I think the ``one'' might be God.
This is a deeply spiritual song which I find it difficult to find
appropriate words to describe.
So I won't. 
This starts out underwater, then adds a serious monster beat, but
that's just form and describing the function admittedly eludes me here.
This is one of the songs with strong house influences and is
related to ``Motion the 11'' a few songs following.

<p>
4. ``Lessons Learned From Rocky I To Rocky III'': Yet another classic
dance number.
There is the damnedest sense of groundedness while you sail with 
``chicks with dicks''.  It's only been out a few months and it's
already a classic.
Too allegorical for me to completely have figured out yet, I'll let you
know after a few hundred more listenings.
When the Motown chorus pops in toward the end, you'll think you're 
somewhere entirely different, but you're not, you're trapped in the Cornershop.
This forms a bit of a bridge to the cultural stew in the next song....

<p>
5. ``Wogs Will Walk'': Whoa, here's Rob Swift again, co-producing
this hip hop street song,
but is it from Tokyo, Berlin, New York City, or is it really just floating on
the web as the song suggests??  Damned if I know.
Obviously, again, a panoply of words in the soundscape.
No, we've been taken prisoner by the X-Men!!

<p>
6. ``Motion The 11'': we're already up and dancing, but then we are slayed.
This is a a dance movement extravaganza.  Hands are thrust firmly up in the air 
as demonstrated by the album cover. 
Cornershop has never made a dance song like this one, by way of Jamaica.
Take off.... no BLAST OFF!
The lyric ``handcream for a generation" appears in this song and a couple
of the others, like ``Music Plus 1".
This music is good for you, as it is not shy about telling you.
Supposedly this was initially released in the summer of 2001 
as a limited-edition white label, but I missed it.
This had the critics buzzing that this was the song of the year
even before the whole album came out.
I can see why, but it isn't even the fourth best song on the album!

<p>
7. ``People Power'': on anyone else's record this would be a great dance song.
Here it is merely another excellent track.
Now <i>TAP</i> people, arrest yourselves.

<p>
8. ``Sounds Super Recordings'': Anoint the sacred beat, bring in just the
right amount of soul music, and commemorate the passing of Supa - 
an Indian songwriter.
Perhaps the most Indian song on the record, and its most essential.

<p>
9. ``The London Radar'': Fly out of India back to London via Genoa!
This song takes place on a plane with all sorts of wacky soundeffects.
``You won't find all that you do here easy'', well that's for gosh
darn sure.
This will be played in the rave houses around the world for sure!
``Is there anything wrong with the passport YOU are carrying?"
After you've checked out others, you had better check yourself!

<p>
10. ``Spectral Mornings'': Let's see what else can we do to make
this record special??  Bring in an electronic sitar for Tjinder to play
and ask Noel Gallagher to guest on guitar.
But don't just ask him to play, ask him to layer himself on top of
himself - about 20 layers of it. 
This may also make the pop charts (probably just because of Gallagher,
but it really is a great song beyond that).
Supposedly this track was streamed over the world for a full day
straight back in February
to become the longest track ever to have been aired.
The version on the CD is over fourteen minutes long. 
Noel himself is said to love it and play it back to himself all the time,
but I don't know if I believe that. 
I can't understand all the lyrics completely, but it seems to be saying
something like, ``if we all just keep playing this over and over, we 
can't kill each other, we can be one as a people.'' or some similar
sentiment to that.
It's just fun to listen to.

<p>
11. ``Slip The Drummer One'': what, a Mickey Finn?  So we can bring 
back Rob Swift on the dip switch again. 
Call the ambulances to take away the dancers after this one!!
I love the electronica and vocoded sound of this ethereally 
deceptive dance song.
This might be my favorite song on the entire record, competing
equally with all of the others.

<p>
12. ``Heavy Soup'' (The Outro): Unfortunately, Mr.&nbsp;Otis Clay 
has left the building, but we're still swinging with the gate.
This crew has done yeoman work, so let's remind ourselves of
one of those killer melodies we've just heard and let the crew
free jam a bit in the background.

<p>
Plus Bonus Track: Let's just hear Tjinder and some of the others fooling
around at a celebration party after the recording sessions.
Why?  Why not??
This record reminds me why music matters.
You can hear St&#233;phane Sudrot ``working the room'' while the sounds play
on over him.
Why?  Why not??
Perfect ending to a perfect record.

<p>
Well, Jim (and a couple of friends copied), I have my first live concert 
notes of the year for you... but not for the event that I had planned! 
After last year's Hickory Smoked Blues festival was such a kick that I 
reviewed it in <i>TAP</i>, I was set to go Saturday, but stayed out Friday 
night until five AM and didn't awaken until hours past showtime. 
Instead I attended a concert by the current bands of two former Grateful 
Dead members.

<p>
Bob Weir's band Ratdog and Bill Kreutzmann's band the Trichromes played a 
concert at Binghamton University.  I went down to Bingo, dropped Mary Jane 
at my mom's, and hiked some of the nature preserve trails behind the 
university.  But the sound didn't carry up there well enough, even when I 
went up the hill so campus would block it less; so I came down and sat 
outside the fence for free.

<p>
Bill's band played ``Sugaree", ``Black Peter", and new Trichromes tunes after 
I got down near the Anderson Center and its outdoor portion with bleachers.  
They played less than an hour.  Ratdog, however, played for two hours 
without a break.  They just came back from touring Europe; they had the 
Stars and Stripes hung but didn't play ``US Blues".  Highlights were 10 to 12 
minutes of ``Eyes of the World", and a free jam that went on about that same 
length.  It was a gentle show, not much loud or fast material, but never 
lifeless, just calm.  ``Shakedown Street", ``Ramble On Rose", ``Brown-Eyed 
Women (and Red Grenadine)", and ``Eyes of the World" were among the `classic' 
Grateful Dead songs that expressed the feeling of this show.  They played a 
few newer tunes these people had composed together, and played a few 
out-and-out jams.  In some cases I'm not sure which category applied.  For
an encore, Bob donned a gray beard and played ``Touch of Grey" in memoriam.

<p>
Not much dancing and I was surprised to see no hackysack circles.  I wanted 
to kick it (like I did in Yellowstone the night Jerry G died, with coworkers 
playing live guitars/bass/drumset/congo on Dead songs) but hadn't brought my 
own hackysack and saw none.  Crowd was a mix of old Deadheads, BU students, 
and assorted locals.  They weren't very lively but they were happy enough.  
I didn't see anyone I knew until after the show when I sought out my 6'5" 
blond bearded buddy among the spilled crowd.  That succeeded except it helped 
keep me out all night in the middle of my workweek.  All in all, I had plenty 
of fun and enjoyed the music and the mile of woods hiking.

<p>
It was the best live music I've heard all year, notwithstanding the fact 
that it's the FIRST live music (other than friends' practices) I've 
heard all stinkin' year.

<i>((Thanks, Mike, I know you're one of the ones who doesn't get excited
about our movie reviews, but I think Steve and I come after it from near
similar perspectives.
I watch virtually no TV (which actually hurts me of course watching some movies
and figuring out the context) and on a Friday night after working hard all week,
usually I'm looking for a relatively mindless movie to laugh at or get scared
at or get excited about a bit.
It is true that a large number of movies are ``products'' and most of them have
very, very limited emotional palettes, but I find most of the art movies made
these days extremely pretentious and are products on a different level.
I actually wonder what the future of audio/video entertainment is?
Don't you??
Well, we'll see, for now let's talk about some mindless movies.
Let's start with a fluffy piece of pure delight....))</i>

``Stuart Little 2" === a movie

<p>
The rule that a sequel is the same story with more car chases and a
bigger body count does not apply.  This is more a case of the same story
picking up a few years later and continuing on.  Stuart has settled in
to family life.  The Littles have a new baby, the littlest Little and
Stuart has moved up to his position as the middle Little.  He's the only
kid in the third grade who drives a convertible to school.
<i>((The story is MUCH better too.
Stuart's ``brother'' is a much better actor this time around,
and there is a whole subplot where he tries to help Stuart
that is just warm and winning.
Yes, perhaps this is a bit treacly, but the treacle is quite yummy.))</i>

<p>
His only problem is that he has no friends.  He is size challenged.
There isn't anyone his size in his class.  None of the other kids want
to play with him out of fear that they might accidently step on him.  It
is a problem.

<p>
Then Margalo falls (literally) into his life.  She is a canary escaping
from Falcon.  She has a sore wing and a dream of flying south for the
winter.  For Margalo every day is an adventure.  She makes a great
friend for Stuart.

<p>
Then the story really takes off and indeed becomes an adventure.
I loved it.

<i>((Wow, one of those sequels that is better than the original,
I liked the original, but loved this!
I agree completely.
Some of the twisty plot devices you can see coming a mile away, but
in the end they don't really matter.
You are left with a classic story of the little guy with a heart of gold
who won't quit.
And Stuart's mom and dad are well drawn too.
Lots of fun, but everyone grows and learns in the end, Stuart, Margalo,
Stuart's brother, the parents, Stuart's friend, and EVEN the littlest
Little - in what is sort of a joke, but still funny.))</i>

``K-19:  The Widowmaker" === a movie

<p>
Based on an incident in the early sixties, the age of Mutually Assured 
Destruction.  The United States had developed a supremecy in delivery 
systems, nuclear submarines that could launch missiles with a range that 
included Moscow.  Many in the Soviet High Command were sure that with such an 
advantage the United States would deliver a first strike.  They had to 
forestall that by showing the United States that the Soviet Union too had a 
submarine missile delivery system.

<p>
The K-19 was such a system, the first nuclear powered Soviet submarine.  
Unfortunately it was still a work in progress.  It was in the shipyard being 
fitted out.  The crew was training.  There were lots of problems.  High 
Command wishful thinking swept them all aside.  

<p>
Liam Neeson plays the captain who was demoted to executive officer because he 
thought first for the safety of his men.  He was only allowed to remain on 
the boat because he was the closest to an expert that the Soviet Union had.

<p>
Harrison Ford plays the captain who replaces Neeson.  He is an experienced 
submariner, and he understands that the mission will succeed.  There is no 
other option.

<p>
The boat is launched, and the bottle fails to break.  The ship's doctor is 
killed (the tenth to die and they haven't even left the docks) trying to stop 
the truck that had delivered the wrong drugs.  Just one of many such 
deliveries.  Instead of radiation suits they had chemical hazmat suits.  
Backup systems either didn't exist or didn't fit.  

<p>
Ford puts the crew through simulated emergency drills non-stop.  The upside 
was that the crew did gain experience.  The downside was that the drills were 
destroying the boat and the crew's moral.

<p>
I never really got to know any of the characters.  There were too many of 
them to deliver more than vignettes.  The final character growth from Ford 
was hard to believe.  He went from Captain Queeg to Jean Luc Picard in a 
matter of minutes.  Tough sell.

<p>
But despite that it was a fascinating movie.

<i>((Lots of the movies I've been seeing this summer (and that Steve and I
have been describing) have been kids or adventure movies.
I found it quite a lot of fun to have a movie with adults.
I'd respectfully disagree with Steve on the characterizations, I really
grabbed character from the radio operator, the party apparatchik,
the Christian sailor, the kid nuclear engineer, the chief petty officer,
the bridge officer with the moustache (I'm not sure what his rank was).
I did miss all those Russian names, but I did grab character.
The movie had a lot of momentum shifts and lots of surprises for me, even
though I knew the original story and had seen innumerable previews.
In the end, the screenwriters pushed a little too hard (Harrison Ford
was one of the Executive Producers and no one reigned him in) and the
director Kathryn Bigelow did a brilliant job with the color palette of
a mostly drab set.
Without trying to be sexist, I was shocked that a woman directed this
very, very male movie, but that it was Kathryn Bigelow is not totally
unexpected.
She has perfectly captured with framing and movement a whole lot of subtext.
And I quickly reminded myself that
she also directed another interesting little film that you can probably rent
from 5-10 years ago called ``Strange Days'' working with James Cameron 
(who I think was her husband for awhile) and 
starring Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett and a gripping Juliette Lewis performance
(she's one of my favorite actresses).
Strange Days is sort of a police scifi thriller with people vicariously 
pumping into other people's lives via technology.
It has the equivalent of a ``snuff film'' at its center (which it shares
with a Nicolas Cage movie that I also like), which should get inside your head.
Hmm, I'm impressed.
More women like Kathryn should be making movies.
I realize I wandered away from Widowmaker, but this movie succeeded for me
even if Harrison Ford didn't.))</i>

``Signs" === a movie

<p>
M. Night Shyamalan really blows me away.  He tells a story!  On the surface 
this is a film about aliens coming to Earth for evil purpose.  That makes it 
a `B' rated flic by convention.  Underneath is revealed the story of loss and 
redemption that lifts it into the or maybe above the `A' flic label.

<p>
It would not be fair to say much more about the story than I have.  This is 
nearly a play.  There is almost no cast at all.  There is only a small set.  
The story is unfolded (or perhaps peeled away would be a better metaphor) in 
interaction between the characters about what is taking place, or in 
flashback.  

<p>
The acting was brilliant.  The two kids were especially effective.  However 
this is not a movie for kids.
Yeah, blown away pretty much describes it.

``Master of Disguise" === a movie

<p>
Once I saw the `Turtle Disguise' in the trailers I knew I had to see the 
rest.  The story (amazingly there actually is a story) isn't very 
complicated.  A young man, Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey), is denied his 
heritage by a protective parent, Fabbrizio Disguisey (James Brolin).  He was 
born into a long line of super-hero Masters of Disguise who use their amazing 
powers to secretly fight evil and support good.  He feels the urge to 
disguise but never got the training.  Instead he got nonstop discouragement 
and training in the arts of being a waiter in his fathers Italian Restaurant.

<p>
Then the evil villain (Brent Spiner) kidnaps his parents.  The villain used 
threats against the mother to force the father to use his powers of disguise 
to steal national treasures.  Pistachio, the last in the Disguisey line, 
receives last minute training from his long lost grandfather and he saves the 
day through the use of some of the funniest disguises attempted by a Master 
of Disguise.

<p>
Remarkably this seemed to be a date film for young teens.  At least that was 
the majority of the audience that I observed leaving the theater.  Maybe they 
were the only ones left by the time I left.  The ending credits alone were 
worth the price of admission.

``Spy Kids 2" - a movie

<p>
``Spy Kids" was a truly innovative exciting work.  ``Spy Kids 2" takes off from 
there and has even more fun.  Being a super secret agent is a kid's fantasy.  

<p>
These kids dance and sing and still manage to play with really slick 
technology.  After all ``A spy is only as good as his gizmos" or so says the 
bad kid spy.  Yes, there are both good and bad spies.  Although by the end 
the differences between them are a little difficult to define.  

<p>
That's part of what makes the ``Spy Kids" genre so good, even the worst of the 
villains really are not bad.  Just strange.

<p>
The villain in this one is planning to take over the world.  He's brought to 
his knees begging for mercy when his daughter says she is going to tell her 
mother, his wife, that he was trying to take over the world again.

<p>
I really like ``Spy Kids" whatever the number might be.

<p>
But the kids are getting older.  Maybe the next one will be ``Spy Young 
Adults".
<i>((I just read that they will only make ONE more.
The main girl, Alexa (I forget her last name) got a lot older, a lot
taller, and a lot more busty since the last movie.
She's probably just 13, but you know what 13 year old girls look like
these days.
I also thought the gadget thing went a bit overboard.
They make a big deal about a rubber band, that clearly will be marketed
for over a buck when it will cost three cents to make that they use in
a horribly stupid way.))</i>

<p>
You have a point about the rubber band.  That was a bit lame.  But mostly 
what I like about Spy Kids is that it is essentially about nice people, not 
terribly bright nice people, but nice just the same.  But you are right, I do 
love the ridiculous gadgets.

<p>
<i>((OK, but I liked Stuart Little as a kids movie a LOT better.
I didn't hate Spy Kids 2, but after I liked the first one SO much,
I was expecting better!))</i>

<p>
I found myself smiling all the way through both movies.  Come to think on it, 
I smiled a lot in `xXx' too.

Disappointing.

``xXx" - a movie

<p>
This was fun.
The premise as demonstrated was that the secret agent who slips out of his 
jump gear wearing a tuxedo doesn't cut it in a world where everyone wears 
tattoos.

<p>
`xXx' (Vin Diesel) is an X-treme Sports political activist who steals a 
Corvette from a right wing Senator and stunt jumps it off a bridge to make a 
political point.  I think the point was ``Kids just want to have fun".

<p>
He gets busted at the celebration party by men in black SWAT with automatic 
weapons and wakes up in a diner.  Things get stranger from there.

<p>
Lots of great action stunts.  Bike jumps over and through explosions.  Vin 
Diesel is a skateboarding, snowbaording, parachuting, parasailing, 
motorbiking, fast driving, rock climbing super hero.  If he isn't doing most 
of his own stunts he has a stunt double that must be a clone.

<p>
His one-liners are not quite as limp as the usual fare delivered by all of the 
`Bonds'.  I especially liked his telling one of the cops who was pinned down 
by a sniper.  ``Stop thinking Prague police and start thinking Playstation.  
Blow things up!"  He follows by sending a heat seeking missile at the sniper.

<p>
There is plenty of room for serials if this makes money.  The story only 
needs a villain who wants to rule and/or destroy the world.  No shortage of 
them.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I think we just hit Adam's summer vacation and he forgot to tell me,
but we'll see.
I'm calling Doug Kent to submit orders.
You may make Summer retreats conditional on who is playing France and
I must hear from Adam by the Summer deadline, or Doug replaces him. 
Whoops, but France has the only retreat, so of course France can make
its order conditional on who makes it....

(DESPER ON SPORTS): 
So...you're in favor of the Vin Baker trade?  Thus far I hate it.  The C's
were almost finally out from under the last of the massive useless contracts
from the Pitino era, and they have to go out and basically put all their money
on Vin Baker, who's been a non-entity for three years?  It's just way too much 
of a risk.  Which isn't to say that it won't work (even though I think it's very 
unlikely), but that they would have been much better off keeping the players 
they had and then trying to get a real start next seaon, when Kenny Anderson's 
contract ran out.  
Chris Wallace does not impress me as a GM.  The Celtics continue to consistently 
draft the wrong people, and the latest trade ties up most of their cap space for 
the next four years.  
Well, Vin Baker had better start riding the bike two hours a day.  

<p>
<i>((We'll see, I like Chris Wallace, and I like this trade.
Go, Vin!
I like it even more after New Jersey's trade for Mutombo.
I think New Jersey and Boston run away from the rest of the East 
in the NBA this year and meet in the Conference Finals again next year.
I like the Celtics chances better with this trade, I do.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passes and
the concession to Spain does not.
This passes under the 102 centers or 3/4 of all centers to
get the draw to pass.
This ending is VERY definitely affected by the passing of Gene Prosnitz.
I thank Doug Kent for being willing to walk into the difficult situation.
It turns out that is not necessary and Gene will be credited with the 
survival in the SEC draw.

<p>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and would like
to volunteer to guest GM a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next ``big'' game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, so we need eight more to get it going.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FRET and FREGT draws are rejected but only the
FRET is reproposed.
Please vote again with your Fall orders.
Generally you need to vote again unless you insist to me that
a vote you have made wants to be perpetual.
Any failure to vote vetoes the draws.
I should note that I don't have a specific rule about calling
a draw with no movement.
You just play on, BUT what I am doing is calling on my rule
for allowing failure to vote on the draws counting as a ``yes''.
This is done with warning.
Starting with the Winter orders, you have to vote EVERY season
or your no vote or failure to vote becomes a ``yes''.
This is the ``fair warning'' before I do that.
Initially this will NOT count those of you who have given me 
perpetual draw votes, but after another period of no movement,
everyone will have to vote on the draws every season.

<p>
2) I've had requests about ``speeding up'' the game.
This is certainly possible, but it only can be done (i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;making this
deadline Fall instead of the quiet summer) with the permission of
all players.
Thus, I'm not sure it matters in this situation, but feel free to 
tell me that your orders for future seasons are good for a quicker 
run of seasons.  We could sail through a game year every other issue
if you want.
If there are no Winter adjustments, be sure to tell me if you are submitting
Spring 1912 orders that can be used right away.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(VIENNA to LIVONIA):  I'm still unimpressed, and your press (in lieu of 
letters or e-mails) doesn't raise my opinion at all.

<p>
(TURKEY to WORLD):  Sultan BRUX hereby announces the ADIG policy:  
All Draws Include Germany.  Those that don't will be mercilessly vetoed! 

<p>
(FAR SOUTH GERMANIC LAND):  ADIG!  All Draws Include Germany!  Yeah! 
Prove otherwise, muhfugguh!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
2) Reminder that Sandy wants to be E-Mailed at her address above, not at
husband Paul's.
Thanks!
And John Schultz has a new E-Mail address too.
Also note Harry's change of postal address.
Got all that??

<p>
3) Lots of changes in the rankings after the second year, eh?
Next time I'll set up the new map and we'll get you ready
for the third year.
Jack moves up to take Austria and the rest of you all move
``down'' a country.
Note that nuke deadline of September 14th, it will pop up quickly,
so get to negotiating!

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM):  I will be moving in a month or two, exact address not yet 
known, so revert to sending mail to PO Box 5309, Torrance, CA 90510-5309 
which should be good for another few months. The bankruptcy court will not 
allow a PO Box as part of my budget. My Chapter 13 Bankruptcy starts formally 
with what is called a 341(a) meeting with creditors on 26 August. By the way, 
I had a visit from a REAL (gosh! wow!)  FBI agent concerning the investment 
fraud that landed me in this situation. Several of the ringleaders have been 
arrested. I turned over all my documents in the case to him, of course. 
Details at http://www.rdi-receivership.com/

<p>
(PAUL to SANDY):  You're asking for a good nuking (next season).  I can 
oblige.

<p>
(BOOB to PAUL): And who held this turn and who tried to move into a home
center?

<p>
(RUSSIA to GERMANY): Did you take any home centers?  May decide future
enemies.

<p>
(GERMANY - ITALY): I could have waltzed into Naples or Tunis, but didn't.
I hope that satisfies you.  Of course, you'll be up near the lead, so
why wouldn't the board again choose to "bomb the leader"?  Seemed like a
reasonable course last time, right?

<p>
(RUSSIA to ITALY): Be glad you aren't on the pissed me off list, or I would
have tried for Naples.  The black hole paths get really weird.

<p>
(GERMANY - RUSSIA): So many unguarded centers, and they're still yours.
Us low men on the totem pole have got to stick together.  Of course,
you're probably way above me now.

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): I know how it feels.  Sucks, doesn't it.

<p>
(BOOB to NYEEDITES): Yeah, it does suck not to be able to participate
in the Fall fun, but your example goes to show you that missing one
year isn't all bad...

<p>
(HARRY-PLAYERS): Paul Rauterberg (France) has assured me that he did not write 
that insulting black press to me that appeared in <i>TAP</i>-260, and I believe him. 
Last issue's ``Andruschak to Kendter" press was also black. The Sara Reichert 
press was black. What's the point?

<p>
(ENGLAND SAYS): I sure wish I HAD written the Royal Queen press.  
Very creative and witty.  
As was all the other black press.
<i>((Some people disagree, I have implemented the <b>TAP</b> house rule
that the Black Presser must abuse the GM (i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;me) at least as much as
any of the players, but he NPR'ed this season.))</i>

<p>
(BOOB to NYEEDITES): Not much very bloody happening this fall....
no bounces at all.
Saving up your bile for the future, eh??

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) Congratulations, Tom, for running away with the victory here!!!
The battle for second place was extremely tight, and when David
made a bit of a mistake a few turns ago he was just barely knocked
out of that running.
But Eric takes second with 25 points, Rick takes third with 24 points,
and John takes fourth with 23 points.
It can't get closer than that, nor could Tom have won by more with those
62 points meaning a 37 point margin, WAY more than the 29 points someone
could get by taking the top four places in a sprint!
Thanks to everyone for playing, I really enjoyed GMing it, think about
joining the next one!!

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ABBOT BUMBLEFACE to BOOB): Only if shouting distance is second or better
at the finish line.  Otherwise, I'd have had to get second or better at
BOTH sprint lines.  I'm just not up to it.

<p>
(ERIC): Dana sips his lemonade and buys beers for Halbert in an
attempt to learn Tom Howell's zen secrets to playing this game.

<p>
(BOOB to ERIC): Tom says he is writing a very detailed endgame
statement for next issue that might say more of what you're looking
for than you might expect.
By the way, about three turns ago Tom told me precisely what the
finishing order of the riders would be (through scoring number 8),
but he didn't tell me who would finish ninth.... ;-)
Yes, I know that doesn't matter a bit!

<p>
(PETEY - &gt;  WORLD): I think I speak for everyone when I say...we got our butts 
kicked badly.

<p>
(BOOB to WORLD): Come and get Tom in the next game!

<p>
(QUABS to BOOB):  Sure;  sign me up for the next game.  Tom's four
consecutive wins must mean he's due for some bad luck soon<font face="symbol"></font
>

<p>
(TOM to ALL):  I sent Jim an outline on Breaking Away strategy and
tactics, but asked him to hold it for the endgame statements.  I might
want to add some more to it.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
2) Note that John Schultz has a new E-Mail address.

<p>
3) I don't know what happened to Sean, I've been E-Mailing him repeatedly to
both of his E-Mail addresses above, and I don't have a phone number.
Sean, you need to give me a phone number if you want me to follow up.
I'm assuming Sean will return, but just in case, we'll call Kurt as a standby.
Builds and removals, but NOT retreats (there's just the one for John) 
may be made conditional on who is playing Spain.

<p>
4) I'm holding some press on Ted Williams from Jeff O'Donnell, partly
due to time and my ability to respond to it at the moment.
I hope to get it in next time.
One quick answer, no, Ted Williams was basically an AWFUL fielder,
but OK in the small Fenway leftfield, like others we could name such
as Mike Greenwell and Jim Rice. 

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``The old glass eye has had its day by
Christmas; And there's talk of death in soft familiar lies; A monopoly
on faded hope; Illnesses and pain; The wet behind the ears just
cannot fill the shoes that size.''
One of the verses in ``Keep On Hoppin','' a not entirely politically
correct song from one of Eric Ozog's favorite Mekons records, <i>Honky Tonkin'</i>.

<p>
(BRITAIN):  I must not manage my time well.  It 
would have taken me about three years to write the Kirk/Spock 
dialogue.

<p>
(JEFF to DAVE): At least the game is no longer boring.....

<p>
(VOICE OF THE POLISH FRONTIER):  Getting bored yet, Dave?

<p>
(UPN TALKS TO RODDENBERRY AGAIN): 

<p>
UPN: We want the Federation to attack the Romulans.

<p>
GR: NO way, I just had them attack the Klingons.

<p>
UPN: You've got to.
If the entire universe doesn't unite against the Romulans pretty soon
they will occupy all of space.
And besides, do you have any idea how expensive those ears are to put
on all those actors?

<p>
GR: This is nuts, I've developed a good working relationship between
Kirk and the Romulan Commander and besides, aren't those Klingon 
foreheads kind of pricey too???

<p>
UPN: We have surplus Klingon outfits from Star Trek VI and Next Generation.

<p>
GR: So you want a Federation-Klingon-Cardassian and Bajoran alliance to wipe out the
Romulans???

<p>
UPN: The Romulans did try to invade the Federation earlier in the series.

<p>
GR: Yeah, but that was because the evil Captain Kirk from the Mirror Universe
was really stupid.

<p>
UPN: You mean you WROTE him stupid.

<p>
GR: O yeah, these guys aren't really real, are they?

<p>
UPN: Not really.

<p>
GR: Is it possible that in the next series Kirk and the Romulan Commander
could form a better alliance.

<p>
UPN: I suppose that would be up to the Romulan Commander.

<p>
GR: Whatever....

<p>
UPN: By the way, are you still dead?

<p>
GR: Why yes, how could you tell?

<p>
UPN: Can you tell me if Bin Laden is up there?

<p>
<i>((Which one, there are oodles and oodles of Bin Laden's.....))</i>

<p>
GR: Rumor has it that his accomodations are ``much warmer'' but I can't 
confirm it.

<p>
<i>((Much warmer than Roddenberry's???  
What do you know about his personal life, UPN, I'd be careful....))</i>

<p>
UPN: Whatever....
