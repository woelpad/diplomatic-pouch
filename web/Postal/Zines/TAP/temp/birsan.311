I also recall that you played this version where the armies and  
fleets were numbered
and if the unit was destroyed you could not bring it back and played  
one unit short forever or
maybe it was that you had only 8 Armies and 8 fleets and regardless  
of your center count you could never get more
that those on the board...
What was the exact weirdness around that anyway?
