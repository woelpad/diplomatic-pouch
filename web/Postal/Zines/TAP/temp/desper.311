Ah yes, the bike race.  I got their responses but I was going to do the same thing in any case.

I'm expecting overstacking on the first turn, but what the heck^TM.

I'm happy to do a DW demo game.  We can pick through the WM04 semifinalists who didn't advance, for starters.

Another cool hilarious movie English that's out it "Hot Fuzz", have you 
seen that yet?  If you can't go wrong with "Afternoon Delight", well....

Also, did you get both Brendan and Andy's responses to the card changes in 
Breaking Away, do I have first turn orders from you?

AND, for Diplomacy World, are we still going to start a new DW demo game?  
How do we want to do that??  Any ideas, I don't have any, but I could come 
up with some if I thought about it.

I posted a brief response to the film on my blog titled "Meet me in Montauk," just a few days before reading the 'zine.  Didn't realize that Doug's zine grabbed its title from the film, and that his film review bit was also titled "Meet me in Montauk".  Part of my thinking about what I'm looking for in SF.  (And not just Kate Winslet, who is probably the best actress of her generation, though I wish she would do more films like ESSM and fewer period dramas - but her latest film "Little Children" was also good.)

One of my grad school colleagues, Tom Bohman, was at MIT when Affleck and Damon were researching this film.  He was fairly dismissive of them, and they later included a postdoc character "Tom" who was a bit dweebish.  Anyway, I'm digressing.

The latter is really becoming an anthem of the Goofy 70s.
