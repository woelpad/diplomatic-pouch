ICFMM - Winter 1913 - France - YES to all proposals -
remove A Par, F Bre.

PRESS - France - All: Regarding the Austrian failure
to mobilize...I believe the Archduke was busy dealing
with the death of the Crown Prince.  It all has
something to do with a magician, Eisenheim the
Illusionist, but details are sketchy.

Secrets - Winter 1921 (really 1921?) - England - ret A
Kie-Ruh, rem F Nat.

Propose E/R?T, E/F/G/R/T

see ya!
