All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
The next <i>Tinamou</i> deadline should be February 18, 2002.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Yes, this is very late, in fact the latest this ever has been in 18 or so years 
of publishing.
The primary reason for this was an insane work schedule on my two jobs (both
of which are nominally full time) and a desire to make sure that Charlotte
didn't feel short changed first.
I think that was met, but I see what happens with folds now better than I
ever have before. 
With each day that you don't publish it seems easier to go another day
not publishing.
But I don't like the feeling and I have a feeling that posting this issue
is going to feel especially good.
Thank you for all your understanding.
Deadlines should be pushed back sufficiently (February 2 and 23) for everyone
to get caught up.
Let me know if you have any other questions about the delay.
I make no promises that I have included everything that should be here,
feel free to nudge me and I'll get completely caught up next time.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Since I've had a few questions about my E-Mail address lately, probably
best to just update everyone.
My Internet Service Provider, The World, which claims to be the first public
subscriber ISP, though I'm sure that is dependent upon how you define an ISP,
is substantially upgrading their equipment and the capabilities for me to 
connect to them.
They are doing this through a ``new'' address, so that mail from me looks
like it is coming from either burgess of TheWorld.com or burgess of shell.TheWorld.com.
But I'm kinda attached to the old Software Tool and Die (the official name
of the company that generates the world.std.com address) and besides I probably
have millions of listings of that address in various places, too many to
try to correct.
So, I'm not changing the official address, but know that each one sends mail back
to precisely the same mailbox.
It makes no difference.
A lot of you have been sending me two copies of things.
But if I hook up to world.std.com instead of shell.TheWorld.com, I run at about
1/4 the speed, so you know what I'll be doing.
It also interfered for a few weeks with me posting to the rec.games.diplomacy
newsgroup, but that also is corrected.
Thanks to those who asked about it.

<p>
I want to say a few words about my subszines.... thanks for being understanding!!!
In here, we have <i>Houdini Blues</i> #8 from Michael Lowrey and he would like
me to plug his Dip and Outpost games - sign up now!!  
Please see Michael's subszine down below or on the Web Page!
Don Williams had been through a bit of a tough time (losing his hard disk on
his computer) but is back publishing with a vengeance and we have lots of
catching up with him down below, helping to make this issue a bit huge....
and David Partridge had a few errors in adjudication, but I believe this is
ACTUALLY the final version down below.
And Dave Partridge is trying to start a new game too, so let me take a 
seat back a bit and not start a new game for a bit and urge you toward
our subszines.
They are uniformly excellent and right now more timely than I seem to be....
;-)

<p>
Mark Kinney is folding his small szine, <i>League of Nations</i>, which had one
game in it that I was playing in (as is Warren Goesle and David Partridge).
If Don or Michael or Russ would like to pick up the game and run in <i>TAP</i>
they would be welcome and could contact Mark Kinney for details at
alberich of iglou.com - I think there is only one player who is not a <i>TAP</i>
subber and I would offer one free if it is picked up here.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My Red Sox team is looking great for next year and so I'm very excited.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW NEW PLAYERS!!
Contact John Caruso at commishjohn of att.net or me for more details.
We have two teams left open at the moment.
 
<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter is unlikely to be starting any new games in the <i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 
I think we have Rip Gooch as the representative volunteer, but he should
get back to me about his plans.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR BILL QUINN</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Bill Quinn was the Boardman Number Custodian in the mid-1980's and won the
Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service to the Hobby in 1986.
More specifically, he was Publisher of <i>Everything</i> during the 
Don Ditter and Kathy Byrne Caruso Custodianships (issue numbers 53-62)
and then took over the Boardman Number Custodianship itself from 
August 1984 to August 1986.
Bill was known for his efforts to organize the BNC records and as
a tireless worker at the task, during a period of one of the highest
rates of game starts in the history of the position.
Naturally, Bill burned out on this eventually and has dropped out of sight.
I think it is time to find him again.... you have until Issue #255!!
Action on the search for's has been lagging lately, use the Internet
for something, search for people!!
The name ``Bill Quinn" only generates 2,630 hits on Google and ``Al 
Pearson'' only generates 728!!
You'll really kick yourself if the AREA person named Al Pearson is the
one that I'm looking for, for example and you can track him down pretty
easily.
Ask our AREA Diplomacy pal Glenn Petroski, gelp of juno.com, if you don't know what
AREA is.....
I'm not amused that the rate of searching seems to have dropped lately,
go find these guys!!!

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<p>Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Goes ON!!

<p>
The second round is now over.  This year a large number of
players went on to Round 2, before they narrowed to the Semi-Final Round
of Seven games to determine who goes to the Finals. 
Prominent semifinalists include: David Malloch (one of last year's finalists),
Paraic ``Fred'' Reddington (tall Irish elfin Diplomat as hard as nails!),
Jack Brawner (best known as Dick Martin's childhood pal), Paul Riley (GM
extraordinaire who proves he can play too!!), Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu
(I'm learning Norwegian so I can talk to him and Frank Johansen in their
own language... my first E-Mails to Joe were more or less understandable),
Yann Clouet (one of France's greatest exports to the English speaking world),
Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira (extremely, even by Dipping standards, arrogant
Brazilian... don't let him bowl you over), Thomas Franke (long acknowledged
as the best German player in the world, showing he's not washed up),
Stephen Agar (my <i>Diplomacy World</i> co-editor is showing he can
play the game with finesse!), Fearghal ``Twerg'' O'Donnchu (the Irish
wildman!!), Christian Dreyer (winner of tournaments and demo games,
extremely dangerous!), Brian Dennehy (wow, he is just a great player,
not second in any book of mine), Jody McCullough (yes, our very own Bay
Area whiz!), Frank Johansen (the aforementioned other Norwegian and the
President of the Norwegian Diplomacy Association), and Chetan Radia
(he of the only 18 center win at this summer's World DipCon). 
Expect this Tournament not to end for another year, though we are obviously
already well into 2001.
The next tournament in the series will be WorldMasters 2002, starting sometime
next year.

<p>
Jody McCullough had the dubious distinction of being the first semi-final player
eliminated, after being jumped by Frank Johansen and Yann Clouet.
Watch out for Frank and Yann now!!!

<p><br><p><br>The Boasters game was a ``demonstration game'' being run within the 
2000 Tournament, but separate from it..... I also have been playing
in another similar demo game there called Road to Rio that you can watch 
at the top of the Webforum page (how come Road to Rio gets such a prominent
position.... ;-).
We have now called it quits on Boasters and I declared Toby Harris the winner,
or at least the Board Topper.
We couldn't generate any interest in picking it back up after World DipCon.
Now Road to Rio also is in a bit of trouble for similar reasons.
It's been a fun game so far, but we have been on break until the first of
the year, waiting to see if we can reignite interest, and have just run
one lackluster turn.
We'll see where that goes.

Deadwood Con Oct 20th/21st

<p>
Jim, I was able to visit Eric Ozog, his wife Cathy and family for the 
second time. I met Buz Eddy and a family up from Oregon. The first game 
we played was `Bounty', a game of collecting cargo of varying value and 
getting this back to home port. Piracy and warships (the law) make for 
interesting twists. I was able to go pirate and nabbed a valuable cargo 
without being pinched by the law. With that haul I was able to win the 
game by the exact count of 150 `doubloons'. Of course, Sarah, whose 
cargo I pirated, wasn't too pleased. The next game was my variation of 
Kingmaker (has some extra `chrome') played by Cathy, Buz and me. Cathy 
Ozog got a good lot of nobles, Buz got some and me, I got none (of any 
consequence). It was only a matter of time (1475) before parliament was 
called (on turn 25) where Henry VI was declared the one and only King by
the (Cathy) Ozog faction. She got the outright victory by a single Lords 
vote. We then played a Seafarers of Catan game which Eric won. I found 
it more complicated than Settlers but this may be because I have not 
played this game much and the board gets some `getting used to'. Our 
Saturday nightcap game was this ``Exploding Cow" game - a hilarious money 
game where the object is to blow up the most valuable cows in your field 
before all the town cards are used up. I think Cathy won this one too.
 
<p>
On Sunday morning, after pancakes and coffee we were able to play one of 
my several variant Risk games. This was my British Isles game with four 
players plus a `rampaging neutral'.  The `rampaging neutral' is a rule I 
have devised to include an extra player (or players - you can use more 
than one rampaging neutral) which is played by all the actual players. 
Cathy, Eric, Samantha and I played British Isles. Eric had the bad rolls 
and was out first. I almost won but for the dreaded 1-1-1 die roll 
followed by a 1-1-2 roll right at the end of the attack I made on Cathy. 
A few turns later Samantha was able to eliminate her and then me to win 
it all. British Isles is a small Risk game with 24 territories to the 
regular game board that has 42 territories. It is `fast and furious' 
(the way all Risk games should be played). In the afternoon, after the 
family from Oregon left, we played another three player game of 
Kingmaker.  In this game, we all got some valuable nobles, Eric having 
the weakest faction, then Cathy and with me having the most nobles and 
eventually the strongest faction. Unfortunately, bad fortune followed me 
throughout the game. An event card dragged the Constable to London (my 
noble - Roos) where he subsequently got plagued. Then my siege of 
Nottingham got delayed by bad weather not once but twice in a row (this 
is almost unheard of). Lastly, when I did take a town by siege who died 
but my Percy (the best noble of my lot). This bad luck cost me the game 
as it prevented me from destroying Eric's faction. If I had done so I 
could have dominated parliament. As it turned out the game lasted until 
1484 (turn 34) when, in parliament, King Henry VI was declared the one 
and only King (as in the first game). The game could have gone on longer 
because there was no clear winner (but time was) and we had to end the 
game. The one other strange occurrence in this game was Cathy getting 
virtually all the ships (the odds of this happening are very high and my 
version has more ships - some of the `chrome' I referred to). Neither 
game of Kingmaker was particularly bloodthirsty (very few nobles were 
killed) except for the royal heirs who were `disposed of' in one manner 
or another (a beheading, a poisoning, a drowning and even an abandonment 
of a five year old in the wilderness). Ah, the `elimination' of your 
rivals, how satisfying! It is great to get together and play some old 
(and new) favorites. Here's one: ``When is a `stab' in the back a good 
thing? If you leave it in you won't bleed to death."

Dear Jim-Bob, I am sorry about the noncommunication lately.
I am equally sorry to tell you that I must withdraw from my games.
I have been very short on free time lately.
I don't think it is fair to the other players to keep them on hold.
I am only going to retire from the szine for awhile.
I will get back into the gaming later on down the road.
I am enclosing a check for you for the two games that I had been playing.

Regarding baseball and the Tony Clark acquisition, I'm with Sports
Guy Bill Simmons, somebody has to clamp down on Duke now before he
can do more damage.

I've heard most of the Gammons stuff before, but not the part about
Billy Beane.  That would be great!  Maybe he'll be able to get
one of those young A's arms somewhere along the way.  

<p>
The Celtics still need a point guard, even after having three picks
in the first round of the draft this year.  Joe Johnson might be
enough to get them over the hump and into the playoffs.  Considering
how many dinosaurs there are in the NBA these days, the C's are
pretty much due.

<i>((Yeah, Billy Beane would be interesting.  He'd revive the farm
system which is desperately needed for sure.
I actually think that Kenny Anderson will surprise you.  He
has played great for the last three games or so, dropping
Palacio to about 10 minutes a game where he belongs.  While
one can certainly question picking Forte (who will never be
more than marginal, I think) over Tinsley, the Celtics are
far from the only team to underestimate him.  And I think
there is progress being made.  Expect the Celts even to 
challenge for a home advantage in the East first round
and in any case I think are one of six teams with safe
playoff spots nearly in hand..... too optimistic?
Perhaps, but that's what I think.
[Late addition to this: that's precisely where things are
going as the Celtics are even challenging for the top spot
in the East....]))</i>

Just a quick acknowledgment that <i>TAP</i>-251 arrived today. You may publish this. 
Procedures have been changing at the Postal facility where I work in response 
to the death of two Postal workers to anthrax and the infection of several 
others. Hopefully, this won't affect my vacation to Mexico starting this 
weekend. Eleven days in Mexico's Copper Canyon region. I have been working 
with a new Therapist-Counselor in adjusting to my post-surgery physical and 
mental condition. She has been a big help in many ways, and I seem to have 
settled well into the ``eunuch calm".  My latest tests confirm that my prostate 
has been put to sleep and I will NOT die from prostate cancer. So there. I 
intend to go on living for quite some time yet. 

<p>
As far as the music section goes, I did indulge myself and buy the CD of the 
soundtrack for the movie FARINELLI. The main interest, of course, was the 
well done blending of two voices to produce a new sound. Nowadays we have no 
real idea what the Castrati sounded like, since much of their abilities and 
sounds came from over 15 years of rigorous training after the knife. Those 
training methods have been lost. How did they manage to achieve a vocal range 
of three and a half octaves? So the CD presented an interesting idea, 
something like a soprano on steroids. Even if nowhere near authentic in sound 
and story line, it represents an interesting experiment.

``Jimmy Neutron ... Boy Genius" - a movie
       
<p>
Animation was barely okay.  Low budget computer animation with some mats.  
Not really appealing.

<p>
Story very limited.  This is a kid's movie, and unlike ``Shrek" and ``Monsters, 
Inc." there isn't a level for adults to enjoy.  This is strictly a kid's movie.

<p>
Luckily I am still a kid in many ways, so I enjoyed it for what it was.

<p>
``Jimmy Neutron" and his dog, ``Goddard" are an appealing pair.  Actually, I 
think ``Goddard" has the edge.  ``Jimmy's" nemesis ``Cindy Vortex" is pretty 
cool too.  So the movie has something going for it, just not a whole lot.

<i>((It also was pretty short, so it held my interest - even though most of
the cool bits were foreshadowed by the previews I'd seen.
I liked it better than Charlotte, probably 'cause I could do the kid thing
more easily.
I also liked Cindy Vortex a whole lot.
What little work they did do on animation was on the space fleet of kids' ships
and they were so overdesigned that they were just lame.
I'm sure you can buy the models for 50 cents apiece at the after Christmas sales.
I also would challenge a bit of Steve's Shrek/Monsters, Inc. comments, I thought
the best bits about BOTH movies were the kid oriented parts of them, I thought
the ``adult interest'' items were just lame and too predictable.
Perhaps I'm just drawing the fun line in a different place though.
I thought the best part of Monsters, Inc. was the simulation or test room,
but I didn't consider that adult interest, just neat.
And it says a lot for Jimmy Neutron that I didn't find Goddard just totally
annoying, since I usually hate dogs..... but he reminded me of Doctor Who's
K-9 a little bit, who I also loved.
Anyway, Jimmy Neutron is not offensive, and it could have been.))</i>

``Ocean's Eleven" - a movie

<p>
Back in 1960 Frank Sinatra and some of his close personal friends thought 
that it would be fun to spend a month partying in Las Vegas and have a movie 
studio pick up the tab.  In order to pull off this scam they made a movie 
about stealing from a Las Vegas Casino.  There wasn't a lot to the story 
beyond having some really top talent mugging their way through a fairly 
pedestrian heist.  Amazingly, or maybe not considering that Sinatra's career 
was peaking just about then, the movie made a lot of money at the box office.

<p>
Forty one years later, George Clooney, with a slice of ``The Magnificent Seven" 
thrown in, has attempted to pull off the same movie.  I'm not sure about the 
close personal friends part.  This time the heist is larger, and the heist is 
a lot more complex, but it is pretty much the same idea made 41 years later.  
Who knows, it may even have the same sort of success.

<p>
``The Magnificent Seven" reference has to do with the gathering of the crime 
crew.  Clooney in the Yul Brenner role and Brad Pitt as Steve McQueen go out 
and enlist as unlikely a crew of `professionals' as has been collected on the 
big screen.  Sinatra already had his crew when his movie started.  They were 
all ex-military and had been working together for years.

<p>
From where I sat it was difficult to remember what the character's names 
were.  They did the mugging required, and may even be more talented as a 
group than the originals.  There isn't a whole lot in the story that requires 
the level of talent offered.  

<p>
Brad Pitt gave probably the best performance as the second in command who 
actually held it all together.  Clooney enlists him from his job teaching 
young television talent how to play poker.  That was probably the funniest 
scene in the movie.

<p>

<i>((I actually really liked ``Ocean's Eleven'', not as much as ``Zoolander''
say, but a lot better than a lot of movies this year.
Brad Pitt was just wonderful, though you're right that many of the other 
supporting actors' excuses for character were a single distinctive ``schtick''
(like Don Cheadle had a British accent and Elliott Gould had a cigar).
And I found Julia Roberts completely silly as a character, but since she isn't
my favorite actress this did not bother me much.
And I love George Clooney, he is just so much fun to watch.
Hey, it more than held MY interest, which is all you can say for a cheap thrill
movie like this one.))</i>

``The Lord of the Rings" - a movie

<p>
Remember when I advised you to read ``Harry Potter" to get a better idea of 
what was going on in the movie?  Well, I am given to understand by two 
friends that the opposite works better for ``Lord of the Rings."  According to 
one of them it is too distracting to keep hearing yourself say, ``But that's 
not the way it happened in the book."

<p>
The first of the trilogy, ``The Fellowship of the Ring" doesn't exactly follow 
the book.  What it does do, in a truly wonderful fashion, is give the flavor 
of the book.  It is true to the spirit of the story if not the details.

<p>
If you are not familiar with the story a being of great evil and power 
fashioned rings of power that were distributed to the elves, the dwarves, and 
to the kings of men.  What none of them know was that there was a final ring 
that held power over all of the others.  That ring was lost following a final 
battle between good and evil in the times of ancient myth.  It was recently 
uncovered, because it was ready to try again to rule the world.  The ring 
itself was sentient and evil.  It made a small miscalculation.  It got itself 
discovered by a hobbit.  Turns out hobbits are harder for evil to turn than 
any other of the manlike folk.

<p>
And so the story begins.  A hobbit has the ring, a shy homebody type who 
really doesn't have a taste for adventure.  His task is to take the ring 
across the world, protecting it from all those who would take it from him, 
and ultimately to destroy it.

<p>
The movie tells the start of the tale and the start of the adventure.

<p>

<i>((I found a couple of problems with this movie and ultimately 
didn't like it all that much, though it seems perfectly designed for
12-15 year old boys, which may be its target audience (he says as someone
who usually likes good movies designed for 12-15 year old boys).
Let's see if I can describe them in ways that won't ruin the movie
for those of you who haven't seen it and will.
First of all, I will see all three movies in the end.
Whereas, I am seriously thinking of NOT seeing the next two George Lucas
Star Wars movies that have a similar problem.
I actually can't believe George actually is subtitling this one ``Revenge of
the Clones''!!
What will the revenge be??
That they go behind the cameras and play with a computer generated George Lucas
before going to one of George's famous bar hopping downtown SF parties??
More likely, we will see far too many computer generated armies producing
far too much video game inspired computer mayhem.
Perhaps it is that I don't play video games, not at all.
But the pacing of Lord of the Rings reminded me of what I think video games are.
I haven't read the books in quite some time (long enough back that I didn't
have the extreme reaction Steve suggests), but I still at one extremely key
point of Orc mayhem and computer generated mass battle wanted to scream ``wasn't
that off camera in the book and why can't it be that here???''
I went home and verified that it indeed was totally ``off camera'' in the book
and wished there was more of that restraint in order to play up character a bit
more.))

<p>
((Also, I played D&amp;D for years in the mid to late 1970's and acquired and
retained a working vocabulary of orcs, rangers, and elves but that part totally
lost Charlotte and she too had read the books a long while back.
Characters and races are thrown in and almost needed subtitles to keep track of.
Boromir and the Ranger look too much alike and sometimes can't be distinguished
and the same goes for some of the hobbits.
You'd think that you could at least keep track of the nine members of the 
Fellowship, wouldn't you??
Well, you can't.
The VERY late production choice to make what was going to be two movies
into three left them breaking off Movie #1 in a somewhat awkward place
(technically just after Chapter 1 of Book 2) and as a bit of a letdown.
In a couple of years, I would probably sit through a marathon of all three
movies together and enjoy it.
It certainly is not a bad movie, but it is NOT the best movie of the year
and I don't think it even is better than Harry Potter.
For sure there is WAY more good character development in Harry Potter than
there is in Lord of the Rings.
I think they did a pretty good job of following BOTH Baggins hobbits
but Boromir got about a minute and a half of character development and
Gimli the Dwarf got even less than that!
Finally, they tried hard, but the Hobbits just didn't look like Hobbits.
The character who played Samwise actually gained 30 pounds for the role,
but he didn't look it and needed to gain at least thirty more.
How can you have skinny hobbits??
But still, by all means, go see it.
It may well keep winning best movie of the year awards.
Perhaps I'm just saying that it is nowhere near that level of quality.))</i>

Very complex story.  Very well acted.  Conspiracy, madness, some of both,

``Not Another Teen Movie" - a movie

<p>
``Not Another Teen Movie" is really all of the teen movies ever made rolled 
together.  I think it will appeal mostly to dirty old men and teen boys.  
There is a lot of female teen skin.  

<p>
The plot is an amalgam of "She's All That," "Cruel Intentions," and "Pretty 
in Pink" along with bits and pieces of every teen movie I have ever seen 
thrown in.  Probably bits and pieces of every teen movie I haven't seen as 
well.

<p>
Most of the funny parts were put in the trailers.  But not all.  I laughed.

<p>
It did get me to thinking how really pathetic teen movies are.  How many teen 
movies have you seen where they take a beautiful girl and hide her behind bad 
hair and glasses, only to fix the hair, remove the glasses, give her a pushup 
bra and a sexy dress to reveal that she is just as beautiful looking like a 
slut?  Oh well.

``Heist: - a movie

<p>
Remember a month or so ago when I was disappointed in the story that went 
along with a caper.  "The Score" was about the experienced old thief and the 
hot young thief.  That was about the whole story.  "Heist" is a similar 
situation, with so much more story that even when you get to the end you 
wonder if it's really over.

<p>
Gene Hackman plays "Joe Moore" an old thief who is ready to retire.  But 
Danny DeVito has one last job that he wants Joe to run for him.  Danny plays 
a sort of fence, moneyman role.  He needs Joe to run the job because Joe is 
the best.  Naturally since he is forcing Joe to run the job he wants one of 
his own, a nephew, to be on the inside, just to make sure Joe stays honest.

<p>
David Mamet wrote and directed.  Mamet knows how to put a plot together.  He 
also writes wonderful dialogue.  There is one other thing he does, too.  He 
puts his wife into everything he makes.  She play's Joe's wife.  She is a 
player.  Joe relies on her to make things happen.  Of course, with Mamet 
behind the story, she isn't totally reliable, and Joe doesn't totally trust 
her.

<p>
Imagine, a caper film and no car chases.  I loved it.

``The One" - a movie

<p>
Which only goes to show that Jet Li can make a bad action film.

<p>
There are 125 `universes' in the `multiverse'.  Now I would have thought 
infinity would be more like.  If you are having parallel universes making up 
a larger multiverse how do you get a limit of 125?  Not that it matters, 
except to the story.

<p>
Jet Li plays multiple roles.  He is ``Yulaw" an ex-interuniverse-agent (a cop 
whose duty is to keep things in balance ... balance is never explained).  On 
one balancing mission he killed an alternate version of himself, and received 
the life-force of the slain version.  Well, actually he received 1/124th of 
the life force.  The other 123 versions of himself split the rest between 
them.  He was obviously very perceptive because he recognized the increase in 
his life power, and so became an agent of in-balance.  He started to visit 
other universes, killing himself over and over again, to get more and more 
life force.

<p>
The movie opens with him killing the 123rd version of himself.  Lots of 
action follows and he is captured and is about to be senetnced to a life in 
the prison universe, when a woman smuggles a white rat that is carrying a 
bomb into the sentencing room.

<p>
More action follows.  Instead of prison he goes to the final universe.  
Possibly our own.  Maybe not.  They are all quite similar.  His goal is to 
kill the 124th alternate and become a god.  Or implode the universe.  There 
is more than a single school of thought here.  The 124th is a cop who has 
recently become nearly super powerful.

<p>
More action follows.  Followed by lots more action.  Then there is some 
action.  And so forth.  Finally the movie comes to an end, followed by some 
more action.

``High Heels and Low Lifes"

<p>
Minnie Driver is so good.  Too bad the same can not be said for her choice of 
movies.  "Beautiful" was dreadful.  "High Heels" is a cut above that, but 
still far from as good a film as her acting would indicate.  As it was, she 
pretty much stole the show going from innocent, to so out of love, to mock 
tough, to chillingly homicidal.  All while continuing to be the good girl.  

<p>
This is a crime comedy that was long on crime and a tad bit short on comedy.  
Even the comic opera police were not all that funny.

<p>
The stroy relied on coincidence to get started, and had too many unexplained 
things happening for it to get credit for a plot.  Great dialogue at times.  
Still, not enough to make it worth watching.

Interesting cinematography, with use of multiple exposure, interesting

What really came as a surprise was that Antonio Banderas can actually act 
beyond the macho arrogant persona he usually projects.  Which isn't to say he 
didn't project macho arrogant in this film, too, but that wasn't always

``Harry Potter" - a movie

First let me say that if you have not read ``Harry Potter" book one then 
please do yourself the grand favor of doing so.  Even if you are not a reader 
do this.

<p>
Second, if you have read the book and have not gone to see the movie, please 
do yourself the favor of seeing the movie.  Unfortunately the book is bigger 
than the movie.  I have yet to see a book that wasn't.  They did a really 
good job of shrinking the book down to big screen size.  But trust me, the 
order of events for maximum enjoyment is read the book, then see the movie.

<p>
If you decide to just go see the movie I am sure you will still enjoy it.  
You may leave the theater wondering about some of the things that took place. 
Your own fault for not reading the book.

<p>
<i>((Indeed, just what I was thinking, although I did not RE-read the first
book just before going to see the movie, having read it a year or two ago 
actually was best of all.
It does make you think about making more than seven movies as the books
get longer and longer.))</i>

<p>
Actually I was thinking they should have made two movies out of the first 
book.  Or one much longer movie with an intermission.  They used to do that 
sort of thing.  Sigh.

<p>
<i>((Oh yes, yes, yes..... but this problem only gets MUCH worse in 
Books 2, 3, and 4!!!  I really worry that some things will be
horribly telescoped.... like doing all of the Quidditch matches
in.... Book 3, I think?  and missing all the details of Hermione's
story of the ``extra classes".... and the other book that has the

etc. etc.  I worry that they will stay hard on THEME and miss
the side fun.  Yes, of course Book 1 could have been four hours too.))</i>

``Spy Game" - a movie

<p>
Both Robert Redford and Brad Pitt were better together in this than I have 
seen them for a while.  Redford's smart senior CIA agent, playing all ends 
against, and Pitt's young idealistic natural CIA agent playing for good to 
triumph over evil came across brilliantly.  Telling the difference between 
good and evil drove them apart.  But in the end it was Pitt's character's 
character which overcame, leading Redford's character into a monumental act 
of self sacrifice.

<p>
<i>((And this is a place where Robert Redford's well known decision
to eschew cosmetic surgery made every line in his face worth watching.))</i>

<p>
The story starts with Pitt making a mistake with bubble gum while attempting 
an unauthorized prison break in mainland China.  The body of the story is 
told through flashbacks in a top echelon meeting where the CIA pumps Redford 
for reasons to hang Pitt out to dry.  Redford refuses to play the game, even 
though he has told Pitt early on that he would.  As the story unfolds it is 
revealed that Redford is the reason Pitt is in trouble.

<p>
<i>((Yes, but not in the usual way one expects.  I found the plot rich
and fresh!
I also liked the way they got high level government bureaucracy (which
I have seen first hand in other agencies) just right in the subtle ways.))</i>

<p>
Complex convoluted story.  If it has a flaw (for me) at all is is that I 
would have liked to see Redford manipulate the CIA into taking action.  If 
the movie has a flaw it is in Pitt's age.  He really isn't old enough for the 
part he played.  The timeline requires him to be mid forties or older, and he 
really isn't.

<p>
Still, excellent movie.

``The Royal Tenenbaums" - a movie 

<p>
Wes Anderson makes intelligent funny films.  ``The Royal Tenenbaums" may be 
his best.  It leads the field now at least.

<p>
The Tenenbaums are a wonderfully dysfunctional family.  Weirdness pervades 
the film in both little and large ways.  These are not real people.  These 
are exquisitely drawn works of fiction.

<p>
Gene Hackman deserves some sort of awards mention for his portrayal of 
``Royal" the world most dysfunctional patriarch since ``Homer Simpson."  He has 
been out of his family's life for 17 years.  But when he runs out of money 
and hears that his wife plans to remarry, he fakes a terminal disease as a 
way to worm himself back into their good graces.  

<p>
What follows is sometimes very funny, sometimes touching, occasionally quite 
dark, but always well written, and unfailingly weird.

<p>
Owen Wilson plays `Eli Cash' the neighbor from across the street who grew up 
wanting to be a Tenenbaum.  He also got a writing credit along with Anderson, 
and a production credit.  Good job.

<i>((I've come to really like Owen Wilson's work.
He was really promising in small parts in ``Anaconda" (a laughably bad movie
of heaving tits [but nothing really explicit] and a leering Jon Voight
that I will likely watch on this upcoming Saturday night again since it's
up against football and Mary Poppins), ``Armageddon'', and ``Rushmore''
(an underrecognized masterpiece which I believe he also partly wrote!).
He was really good in his first starring role in ``Shanghai Noon'' (I love
Jackie Chan movies! - there's a sequel of that one coming out soon, I think) 
and then he was stunning in ``Meet the Parents'' and ``Zoolander''.
I look forward to seeing this Tenenbaum movie... 
and he's also in ``Behind Enemy Lines'' - I guess playing a bit against type, 
but he was really good in that too, a fun little movie.))</i>

``A Beautiful Mind" - a movie

<p>
I think Ron Howard may be a genius.  Maybe not, he may only be a borderline 
genius.  There is as much difference between borderline genius and genius as 
there is between average man and borderline genius.  That is to say, they 
really are so different that it is hard to communicate one to the other.  Ron 
Howard has made some truly impressive movies in his career.  That could be 
near genius with a lot of hard work and luck, or true genius.  Tough call.

<p>
The reason I rambled through the above is because the movie makes the point 
that there is a difference again between genius and true genius.  Tom Nash is 
a true genius.  This was a true story about a man whose beautiful mind came 
up with some original ideas.  He thought of innovations in ways to think 
about things that ultimately won him the Nobel Prize.  What makes the story 
exceptional is that he did it over a lifetime of fighting with schizophrenia    
complete with paranoid delusions.  There is no cure for schizophrenia.  What 
there is comes in the form of medicine to dumb you down to the point where 
the delusions don't upset you.  The prognosis is continued deterioration 
until you have to be turned into a vegetable.

<p>
Ron Howard makes exceptionally good movies.  He probably is a genius.

<p>
Oh, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly were incredible as the Nashes.  Paul 
Bettany and Vivien Cardone were both wonderful in their roles, too.  
Exceptionally good movie this one.

<i>((Yeah, even more so since I couldn't see how they possibly could
take such a complex real life story and make it into a coherent movie.
The Economist in me wanted it to be more about the difficulties of his
theories (Nash himself is rather skeptical about how we economists use
them), the government bureaucrat in me wanted it to be more about the
RAND Corp. work that he did, and the academic politician in me wanted
it to be more about the various really thorny problems that Nash
created for the system in his life (including the really touchy
debates that led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in the end).
They cut all three of these out nearly completely.
Then, I thought it could have been about his sons (the illegitimate one
that they left out completely) or the one they did show only as a baby
who has suffered the same demons as his father.
But no, they made it about the central love story, and Ron Howard did
it so touchingly!
I loved this movie, even as it was somewhat fictional.
What brilliant moviemaking!!))</i>

``Impostor" - a movie

<p>
Gary Sinise put his own money into making this movie.  I hope the investment 
works for him.  I like Science Fiction and this was quite a bit better than 
average for that niche.

<p>
The story premise is that Earth is at war with aliens from Centari (wherever 
that may be).  ``Spencer John Olham" (Gary Sinise) is a scientist who has just 
completed work on a weapon that might allow Earth to start fighting back as 
equals in the war.  So far the Centari have the technological upper hand.

<p>
In fact the Centari are capable of duplicating humans down to their very DNA 
and replacing them with the duplicates.  The duplicates even have the 
memories of the originals.  They don't even know that they are not the 
originals.  What would be the point of that?  The duplicates also are 
infested with nano-bots whose function are to come together to form a high 
energy bomb when the duplicate comes into range of its target.

<p>
Earth Security has reason to believe that has happened to ``Olham".  The movie 
is the story of Earth Security trying to detain or kill him while he attempts 
to prove them wrong.

<p>
The story has several logic flaws that are big enough to accomodate a truck.  
The fault of the drugs Philip Dick was taking when he wrote it no doubt.

<p>
But the story does hold together well enough to show off the very intricate 
world of the future that was created as the setting.  Great attention to 
detail.  Technology and war torn planet all very well presented.

<p>
I liked it.

<p>
<i>((Hmmmm, not sure that one was released around here yet.
If it is better than his Mars movie (which won't be difficult)
I'll at least seek it out!
Let's stick in some alternative thoughts from Rick Desper!))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Thu, 10 Jan 2002 18:34:44 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
A few thoughts regarding the big holiday movies.

<p>
What did we see with Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings?  Well, what these
two movies prove is that, when given a good story to work with, Hollywood can
still make a great movie.  The problem is that the Hollywood executives always
feel that the best place to cut corners is with the script.  Or, they have vague
and fuzzy concepts linking ``script elements" with commercial success.
Considering how relatively cheap good writers are, I would think that a good
studio would simply decide to consistently use them, instead of letting the
marketing people write the movie.

<p>
Barton Fink would agree with me.
<i>((No doubt!!! 
Let there be more Barton Fink....))</i>

<p>
The Harry Potter phenomenon shows that there is a yawning gap in our culture
dying for half-decent literature.  Aside from Harry Potter, there has been
almost nothing in terms of fun books for children written in the past 20 years.

<p>
I like HP a lot.  I liked Lord of the Rings a lot more.
                                            
<p>
Lord of the Rings is the better movie, IMHO.  It's based on a better story.  The
Rings trilogy is <i>the</i> foundation of the fantasy genre.  It remains unequalled.
(And please don't even bring up Robert Jordan!  Somebody needs to slap the man!)
I find myself at a loss of words to describe why I feel this way.  The LotR
movie makes many shortcuts from the books, but every time I saw one, I saw that
it was necessary to make the film cogent for a person who hadn't read the books. 
<i>((I suppose, but there could have been more time for more of that if
they had a bit less cartoony violence....))</i>                 

<p>
For example, the book takes a long, long time with the whole Nazgul chase as
the four hobbits are going to Rivendell.  Thankfully, the movie cuts a lot of
that short, while retaining the essential elements including the meeting with
Strider, the fight with the Nazgul, and the dash to Rivendell at the end.  Also,
the movie opens with a lot more information about who Sauron is than is ever
there in the book, and it covers Gandalf's troubles with Saruman while they are
happening, rather than waiting for later.  These are necessary changes.  But the
movie still gets a lot of small things right, like how Legolas walks around on 
the top of the snow while the rest of the Fellowship has to plow through it like
the heavy creatures they are.  I'm really looking forward to The Two Towers.
<i>((Unfortunately, I missed this important small point..... I'll have to
watch it again.))</i>

<p>
I've seen a few other movies recently, but the only one which I think really
needs mention is Mulholland Drive.  I thought it was a great movie.  I don't
want to talk about it too much, since the details of the plot are best
experienced as a surprise while they happen.  Let me just say that Naomi Watts
was simply terrific in this movie.  I had been leaning toward Nicole Kidman for
Best Actress for Moulin Rouge (one of the only other decent movies I saw last  
year), but now I would definitely want Naomi Watts to win.  And Laura Harring is
also terrific, and could be considered a nominee also for Best Actress (it would
be absurd to view either as a ``Supporting" actress: if you have two leads of
opposite genders neither is ``supporting", and I think that should also hold
here.)

<p>
Anybody who wants to know if they should see the movie, the answer is yes!
There are a lot of dream elements to the movie, many of which I picked up while
they were happening.  The transitions from scene to scene are sudden and
jolting, the characters (esp. ``Betty") are unreal to an extreme - even for a
David Lynch movie!  I think a good exercise is to list the kind of narrative
features you expect in a dream, and then see how many of them appear in
Mulholland Drive.

<p>
I really need to see this one again.  I had been thinking LotR would be a good
Best Picture winner, but Mulholland simply blows it away.

<p>
Of course it won't win, but who cares.  I mean, who really thinks ``Braveheart"
was a great movie?  Nice scenery, good face-painting, but that was about it.   
And that won over ``Remains of the Day''.

<p>
Hi.  Just to warn you - I have a new toy.

<p>
Remember the old days of Conrad sending you those (sometimes awful)
cassettes with all manner of strange music?  Well, now I have a CD
clone-maker, and it's time to make use of it for my friends.  There's a
parcel on the way - things that might interest you.  Enjoy.  And if you
don't enjoy, there's no particular financial investment here, so just
trash 'em.

<p>
<i>((Oh boy, wow, but I DID enjoy them!!!))</i>

<p>
It all started at the end of last summer on eBay.  I bid on, and won, a
CD - nothing special, or so I thought, just interesting to me.  (It happens
that it was an Italian knock-off - pirate, in other words - of a live broadcast
from the NY Phil. in 1954, Bruno Walter doing the Bruckner 4th.  My
winning bid was something like $12, no big deal.)

<p>
Little did I know.  About an hour after the auction ended, I got an e-mail
message.  Some fellow I'd never heard of, who began by informing me that
he'd gotten ``stuck in traffic" and couldn't get home for the end of the
auction in order to outbid me.  And he REALLY wanted this particular item
(``It's important to me and several other people") and would pay me $75 if
I would relinquish my right to buy it from the seller, and in addition he'd
make me a clone for free.

<p>
Well, after spending some considerable time re-wiring my jaw, which had
fallen off, I replied:  Gee, if it's that big a deal to you, who am I to
stand in the way?  So yes, he could have it in return for the clone, and
never mind the $75, I wasn't much in need of a bunch of unearned money
when I was going to get what I wanted anyway (and for free).

<p>
So the deal was done, and then the clone arrived - along with my ``good
deed" reward.  Turns out the guy is an exec. with National Public Radio in
Connecticut, and in addition he's part of an informal `consortium' that
has acquired, archived and catalogued in excruciating depth every single
recording ever made of a Bruckner symphony, LP and CD.  (They don't
specifically do 78s, but virtually everything ever done in that format was
reissued at some point anyway, so as a practical matter they have it all.)
There are literally thousands, and they have just about everything - the CD
I'd won was one of the few things they hadn't yet found, and needed for
completeness.  So anyway, I was given the URL of their archive listing and
told to choose any three items I wanted - in return for my gesture, those
three items would be cloned and shipped immediately.  And they were.  And
I am a happy person.

<p>
But meanwhile I got to thinking how nice it might be to have my own clone
machine.  So I started checking, and looking at sales, etc., and finally
went up to Circuit City and bought one.  On sale, plus a small rebate,
plus 100 blank CDs tossed in (``free") as a come-on.

<p>
Of course, it wasn't quite that simple.  Seems I'd done my homework
slightly inadequately.  The clone machine wouldn't work in my computer - it
required as an OS Windows 95 release 2 or higher, and I was running release 1 
- so, upgraded OS required.  Worse, and in my opinion fatally so, the memory
requirements of the clone machine were just barely within the range of
what I had available; if I'd installed it, I'd have been right on the edge of
having the hard drive's memory completely full.  And you know as well as I
do that isn't a particularly good idea (and usually doesn't work right
anyway).  So - bigger hard drive needed to go with the new OS.

<p>
So I thought and thought, and finally decided that what I really needed for
my new toy was a new system!  Nuts to that old petty 2.3 gb hard drive, I
wanted a big fat one- and so, off to the computer shop, and now we have a
40 gb drive and Win 98 (and, in the process, a spare computer! - which has
since crashed, but can easily be fixed, which I'll do during the
after-Christmas sales when I can probably pick up a small hard drive for
next to nothing).  And the clone-maker is in and works fine.  Sort of....

<p>
It copies CDs directly without a problem.  But it is also supposed to be
able to make custom CDs - transferring cuts from multiple discs onto a
new, custom-designed one - and I can't figure out how to do that.  The
documentation appears at first glance to be clear, but I must be missing
something because it doesn't accomplish what I want.  I need to find an
expert to come in and tell me where I'm screwing up....

<p>
But meanwhile, have some exact-copy clones for your delectation.  For this
first installment it's all choral music, from that period that you know I
love so well:

<p>
1.  Haydn Missa Cellensis, the so-called ``St. Cecilia Mass," in a
period-instrument performance that is simply stunning.  (And this is,
after all, my very favorite setting of the Mass, so I could live a very long
time without ever tiring of this.)

<p>
2.  The same, in a more traditional (modern styling) performance that
until now has been considered THE standard.  Just so you get the chance to see
what can be done both ways.  (Note, with this one the original is part of
a 2-CD set, one disc for the Haydn and the other for a bunch of Mozart
stuff.
I have NOT copied the Mozart disc.  But the `booklet' still lists it.  Do
not try finding it, it ain't there.)

<p>
3.  Three masses by one of my newest fun obscure discoveries, Jakub Jan Ryba
(1765-1815) - of the three settings, the one in e minor is a real gem, the
other two lots of fun but not quite so striking - the guy drew heavily from
Czech folk tradition, writing ``for the people" rather than in the more
elevated Haydnesque style - intriguing.

<p>
4.  A disc of religious settings by an earlier (and equally forgotten)
Czech fellow, Franz Ignaz Tuma (1704-1774), who in addition to being earlier
also writes in a consciously archaic style.  Very much worth knowing.

<p>
5.  ((And last, for now.))  A concert for the Feast of the Holy Innocents,
which you may play in celebration on Dec. 28 if you wish, or not - it's your
life.  It consists in a Mass and a Litany by Michael Haydn, with a couple of
Mozart organ sonatas tossed in at appropriate times, and some traditional
plainsong sequences, all to recreate what might very well have been a real
Holy Innocents service in Haydn's own time.  Performed in period style by
the American Boychoir with a small New York instrumental group.  This, for
me, is a disc to treasure.  (And this despite the fact that I have other,
``better," performances of both the Mass and the Litany.)

<p>
This is the end of another endless message.  Do get some enjoyment out
of this.  Or at least pretend to.  And keep in mind that, of the free 100
blanks I was given, I still have about 85.  The future looks bright for
illegal copying....

Hi, Jim,

<p>
Did you get up at 5am today for the Leonids' 1767 comet debris? I did. 
It was excellent, best since a Perseids shower a long time ago. The 
people in Asia seeing the 1699 and 1866 paths must have had a real trip.
In a minute, I'm gonna check one of the websites to see if we got 
overlap of those two trails.

<p>
2:30 pm EST:  The American Meteor Society site has a graph of the first 
wave's activity, but nothing on the second and third waves yet.  They 
report a half-hour of peak activity over 2500 meteors per hour, and one 
and a half hours above half-maximum activity level (1250 meteors per 
hour).

Too bad.  My place is so rural that I could watch it from my porch with 
no lights in sight... the hill's curvature and forest blocked light from 
the villages of Spencer and Candor, so the planet near Orion (Jupiter?) 
and Sirius were the brightest lights in my field of view.  The weather 
here was very clear, no cloud blockage and not much haze.  A jacket, a 
winter hat, a corncob pipe, and a Saranac Black &amp; Tan helped fend off 
the cold.  It was a good show, but it would have been nice to see the 
other two trails seven-to-eight hours later.  Hey, there's a promo that 
might be a good hook: we should tell the World DipCon bidders to select 
a site/date combination when there's a comet or eclipse or meteor shower 
viewable from that part of the world.  It might be justification for 
attendees as being ``efficient" to take a long voyage for multiple 
reasons instead of ``just for a game".

<i>TAP</i> - Music Picks for 2000!

<p>
Greetings,

<p>
Every year you ask for music picks and every year I mean to send you some.
Seeing as it's now 2002, I thought I'd send you my picks for 2000! I'll get
you the 2001 picks later. So anyway, here goes...

<p>
<i>((Good, you're RIGHT with me.
I'm going to do both next issue, I think.))</i>

<p>
pre-2000 albums I want to mention:

<p>
David Gray - <i>White Ladder</i>: First released in 1998, this was picked up by
Dave Matthews' iht label and released in the US in 2000. It had stayed on
the Irish charts for more than a year, and stayed on the charts for a long
time here too, really breaking in 2001 when radio FINALLY started playing
some of his stuff. But some of the best songs here will never be played on
US radio, as they're just a little too dark. ``We're Not Right", for
example, is a wonderful song which will never get played on the radio.

<p>
Hank Dogs - <i>Bare Back</i>: The stunning 1999 debut from this London trio blends
folk rock, country and Celtic. The executive producer is Joe Boyd, who is
probably familiar to some <i>TAP</i> readers for his work with other great bands.
Nice acoustic guitar work, interesting slightly dark lyrics, and heavenly
harmonies. If you like good acoustic music you'll like this album.

<p>
Female Vocalists:

<p>
Laura Satterfield - <i>Dirty Velvet Lie</i>: I heard the track ``Naked and Scared"
on a show dedicated to Native American music and I had to have this album.
The rest of the album turned out to be just as good. Laura has been on a
couple of other albums in a group called Walela which features Rita and
Priscilla Coolidge as well (she's Priscilla's daughter). I've heard those
albums are pretty good too. She wrote or cowrote all of the songs, except
for the old Jimmy Cliff song ``Many Rivers to Cross". She has a smooth voice
which can occasionally be a little too sweet and breathy, but she pulls it
off so well she gets away with it.

<p>
Neko Case and Her Boyfriends - <i>Furnace Room Lullaby</i>: She's had a couple of
7" releases and one other album, but she really hit her stride with this
one. Described as alt-country, but that doesn't quite do it justice. These
songs cut right to the bone. And then there's that voice. She goes from a
Patsy Cline warble to a Billie Holiday simmer, and lots of other stops in
between. Every song is a little different, but all are well-crafted with
good melodies, excellent lyrics, and oh, that voice.

<p>
Other:

<p>
Underworld - <i>Live, Everything Everything</i>: This is dance music with an edge.
The buzz has been that Underworld puts on a great live show, and if this
disc is any indication, the buzz is right. Also available on DVD with lots
of images and links and extra goodies.

<p>
Muslim Gauze - <i>Azure Deux</i>: Okay, okay, this mix of traditional muslim music
and modern techno probably isn't for everyone! But if you've got a taste
for something a little different, you could do worse than sample this one.

<p>
Compilations:

<p>
These were all available at Starbucks. Don't laugh, there's some good stuff
here! And if you hate Starbucks, you can always go to www.hearmusic.com.

<p>
Songs of The Siren, Her Own Story: This leans towards smoky ballads, but
includes some peppier stuff too. This one would be worth it just for Shelby
Lynne's achingly sad ``Looking Up" and Rebecca Pidgeon's superb version of
``The Word Around Town", but there are lots of other good tracks too.

<p>
Hear Music Volume 2, Songs for long narrow stretches: You'll recognize some
of the acts, but only a real music freak would know all the bands on this
one. But this is a very solid compilation. All of the songs are good, right
down the line.

<p>
Hear Music Volume 4, Sidewalk music from here to there: This one has more
of an upbeat World feel to it. It's supposed to remind you of taking a walk
in a city and hearing the music pouring out from various places. I'm not
sure I buy the premise, but there's some damn good songs there.

<p>
Note: Some of this stuff is on independent labels and may be difficult to
impossible to find, depending on where you live. If anyone wants help
tracking one of these down, feel free to email me. I can probably get it
locally or point you to some place on the internet. And I'd be happy to do
that.

<p>
Well, that's all for now. I may jump back to '98 next time, because a lot
of good stuff came out that year.

<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Thu, 10 Jan 2002 18:02:10 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
NFL:

<p>
The Rams are at least two notches above anybody else in the league.  Their 
offense is possibly the best I've ever seen; the only one I can think of it 
which would rival them is the old 49ers offense.  But the 49ers never had 
Marshall Faulk.  I would take the Rams, giving 7 points, in the Super Bowl, 
right now.  Without waiting to see if they make it, or who their opponent is.

<p>
Three of the four best teams are in the NFC.  After the Rams, I would take the 
Steelers, 49ers, and Packers, in that order.  The Steelers have the best defense 
in the NFL right now, a great running game, and their passing game has been 
excellent this year.  The 49ers defense has been silently excellent recently, 
and they have the only offense which could rival the Rams.  The Pack have a very 
good, if erratic, defense, a great feature back in Ahman Green, and, of course, 
Brett Favre, who is the one QB I would want at the end of a close game.  

<p>
The NFC is much stronger than the AFC this year, at least at the top.  What 
happened?  The Ravens, Colts, and Titans all fell off badly this year.  
Meanwhile, the Packers and 49ers are back in gear.

<p>
Then there's the Bears.  I like the Bears' defense and their running game, but I 
think they have a great record based on a soft schedule and a couple of lucky 
wins.  They will not be able to compete with the Rams.  They should make it that 
far, because the Eagles should beat the Bucs in Philly.  The Bucs are extremely 
erratic and emminently stoppable.  At times their defense is brilliant, at other 
times it's positive porous.  The Eagles have a very good defense, but Donovan 
McNabb is way too excitable.  If he can rein his enthusiasm in, I could see them 
beating the Bears.  And they might be the team with the best chance to beat the 
Rams, but it's slim.

<p>
The 49ers' problem is that, even though I think they are a better overall team 
than the Packers, they have to go to Green Bay.  They are not going to win in 
Green Bay.  It just won't happen.  And then the Packers would have to play the
Rams - that would be a great game to watch.

<p>
The AFC is much, much thinner.  Look at the QBs: Gannon, Brady, Stewart, 
Fiedler, Testaverde, and Grbac!  Yikes!  Only Gannon is a top-flight QB I would 
trust in a big game, though Stewart has really improved a lot.  Tom Brady is, 
right now, the most overrated QB in the NFL.  I like the guy, and the fact that 
the Pats have been winning, but there is no way anybody will be able to convince 
me that the Pats should simply let Bledsoe go based on a lucky streak of 14 
games during which Brady's numbers were underwhelming.  I'm not saying that the 
Pats should bench Brady, but rather that they ought to let both guys compete for 
the job next summer.  Unless somebody is willing to give them a great deal for 
Brady (not Bledsoe), in which case they ought to take the draft picks and run.
Brady's arm is nowhere near as strong as Bledsoe's, and their command of the 
game is approximately average.  The only advantage of Brady over Bledsoe is that 
his decision-making never sinks to the dreadful low points that Bledsoe's has.

<p>
But who will come out of the AFC?  Pittsburgh, almost by default.  I could see 
the Jets beating the Raiders again, but then they would be hard-pressed to win 
in Pittsburgh.  Miami should have the edge over the Ravens, who looked 
positively awful on Monday night against the Vikings.  Grbac looks just 
horrible: he has no confidence and the passing game is very weak in the Red 
Zone.  The running game disappeared when the let Priest Holmes go to Kansas City 
and Jamal Lewis promptly disappeared for the season.  Also, the defense is not 
playing as well as they did last year.  

<p>
To the games:

<p>
Philly (<font face=symbol>-</font
> 3 1/2) over Tampa Bay.  I like the Eagles defense a lot, and also Duce 
Staley and Donovan McNabb.  I don't like the Bucs offense at all.  

<p>
Jets (+4 1/2) over Oakland.  I cannot tell who will win, but I would gladly take 
the Jets and the points.  Oakland doesn't have a great running game.  They have 
a very good passing game, but the Jets pass defense is also good.  Wild 
variables: the Jets won last weekend even with 3 turnovers, if they have fewer, 
shouldn't they do better?  The other change from last weekend: Sebastian 
Janikowski is coming back.  Had he been kicking last weekend, the Raiders likely 
would have won.  I would not put money on this game.  Let's say the Raiders win 
a close one, though.

<p>
Miami (<font face=symbol>-</font
>2 1/2) over Baltimore: practically a gimme.  Baltimore will not be able 
to run against the Dolphins in Miami.  That leaves them with Grbac and the 
Ravens' receivers against Miami's corners, who are among the best in the game?
I'm surprised the line is this low.  I predict a rout.  I would put a lot of 
money on this game.  

<p>
<i>((Taking the easy comment, gee, you got that one totally backwards,
didn't you....))</i>

<p>
49ers (+3 1/2) over Green Bay.  I think Green Bay will win a close game.  This 
is clearly the game to watch this weekend, as both teams are good enough to be 
legitimate Super Bowl contenders, and the game features two of the best three 
QBs in the league (along with Kurt Warner, of course).  

<p>
Next week:

<p>
Raiders at New England: I would predict a cold snowy day which grounds the 
Raiders air attack.  Also, I think the Patriots defense is up to the challenge 
of stopping Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.  The other possibility here would be Miami 
at New England, and I'm pretty sure that they'd fire up the snowplow for that 
game.  In any case, the Pats will win their home game.
<i>((They're predicting snow, so you might be right even though it's the
Raiders....))</i>

<p>
Miami at Pittsburgh:  Pittsburgh in a fairly easy game.  The Fish will not be 
able to move the ball at all in Pittsburgh.  Fiedler is not good enough, nor is 
Lamar Smith.  And though the Fish defense is strong, the Steelers will run over 
them.  

<p>
Green Bay at St. Louis: another great game!  Well, at least in the pre-game 
hype.  The problem is that the Packers defense is nowhere near good enough to 
stop the Rams, while the Rams defense is good enough to slow down the Pack.  
Rams win, by a lot.  Take the ``over" in the over-under line.

<p>
Eagles at Chicago:  Bears playing in Soldier Field in mid-January?  Could 
challenge the records for coldest NFL game ever.  Or at least in the post Ice 
Bowl era.  The Bears are well-designed for playing in the cold.  This would be a 
fun game to watch for throwback fans.  Take the ``under" in the over-under line.

<p>
Conference championships:

<p>
Pats at Steelers: here the dream is dashed.  The Steelers are a mature team 
ready to return to the Super Bowl.  The Pats are a fluke in a weak conference.  
I just think the Steelers are too strong.  But the Pats will give them a very 
tough game.  The Patriots defense is very, very good.  They don't look 
impressive because they give up a lot of yardage, but they are usually great at 
preventing TDs.  

<p>
Bears at Rams: this will be another rout.  The Rams are strong enough to cruise 
past the Bears defense.  Lots of points.

<p>
That will bring us to a rematch of Super Bowl XIV, also known as the ``Heaven Can 
Wait" Super Bowl, pitting the Rams against the Steelers.  It will be a close 
game until late in the game when Kurt Warner appears to have a terrible spinal 
injury.  He'll be carted off the field, but then will miraculously return to 
play in the game when he's possessed by the spirit of Joe Pendleton.  

<p>
The Rams offense is a lot better than the Steelers defense is.  I don't see any 
defense in the NFL right now which could stop the Rams, except, for some odd 
reason, the Bucs defense, which is unfortunately attached to a very weak 
offense.  

<p>
<i>((It's hard to miss the Patriots around here and I feel right about
the way you do.  It seems a shame to let Bledsoe go when it
seems clear that he really is the superior quarterback for
the long run.))</i>  

<p>
I agree: I mean, I cannot imagine Brady having a string of 400-yd games.
Bledsoe used to put those stats up easily.  Sure he's a bit dumb in the clutch, 
and tries to hard to turn a losing situation into a winning one, but in terms of 
physical talents, he is clearly ahead of Brady by a lot.

<p>
Brady is having the kind of streak which we've seen in the past from QBs like 
Jim Harbaugh, Neil O'Donnell, and most recently Trent Dilfer.  In the long run, 
you really should go with the better QB, and that's Bledsoe.

Be careful if you aren't on AOL sending messages to AOL members.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Reminder: Most games in <i>TAP</i> are named after songs by the Mekons, the
greatest rock and roll band in the world..... in my humble opinion.
This game is named after the first song on <i>Honky Tonkin'</i> which I
think is Eric Ozog's favorite Mekons album (complete non sequitur)...
anyway, ``I Can't Find My Money'' leads off with a sort of country 
salsa beat and then the vocals have a rap quality to them.
Not the greatest song in the world, but their usual complex message.
``Keep on Hoppin'" is a great dance song on this album and is a great
highlight of live shows and that one I quote in my regular Mekons'
quote down below.
But this song seemed to speak to how ***I*** keep losing money on
the szine, you all get this game for free, enjoy it!!
Dan or ``Fool'' suggested that I call the game ``Please Check Your Facts
(Before Posting Nonsense to Usenet)'' but all of you are not 
rec.games.diplomacy users, so that wouldn't work.
Besides, I want to consider my insidious Mekons marketing.

<p>
2) Mr. von Metzke has assigned us a Boardman Number, and this group
deservedly gets game F, but in doing so we uncovered a PROBLEM.
Warren Goesle will have to adjust HIS game that just was ALSO 
assigned 2001D (as the game that follows was) and get 2001E,
thus I get F, as it should be.
You wouldn't think Conrad would get confused with so few numbers
being given out, but in reality that actually makes it easier.
Thanks, Conrad.
We won't let you get away easily!!!
That actually does make six numbers assigned in 2001..... well, 
that is pretty pathetic, isn't it??

<p>
3) But what is REALLY pathetic is that for most of you this is
your first postal game and I have seriously let you all down.
I will not do that again and use that as the engine to keep
the szine pumping along.
I hope we can get things going now.
Write press, it's fun, and even Fool can do it!!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SOME EXCERPTS FROM THE SONG AFTER WHICH THE GAME IS NAMED):
``People say I'm happy and I like a drink or two;
Suspended in the darkness, I weep like a child......
I sleep the sleep of faithlessness; 
Lying underneath your bed of nails;
Listening to your cries in the silence of the night;
As your body crashes down above my happy smilin' face;
Oh kind Policeman please take me to jail;
My crimes are as many as the lines on my face.....
I can't find my money;
Oh, no!  
I can't find my money!!''

<p>
(BOOB to ALL): In recent years, my ``Boob'' moniker has been
used relatively less, but I have a feeling that it will
come back in this game in spades...... oh dig me a grave,
where the EYE-talians Rome, and the Turks and the Austrians
play....

<p>
(FOOL to ALL): 
There is some concern on the part of one of our American players that
these postal letters that have been sent across the border have been
intercepted by the notoriously nosy Canadian Postal Service, who might
misinterpret them as some weirdly coded instructions for the next
terrorist attack and turn them over to the Americans. Let me assure you
that this is, in fact, the case, and the FBI did come knocking on my door
inquiring after a certain Baron von Blurbist.

<p>
Fear not, as the FBI had no jurisdiction here. They don't let us carry
guns up here, but a few good swift whacks with a trusty hockey stick did
the job just fine, just like in those Hollywood actions movies
(incidentally, in case you didn't know, when American movies get exported
to Canada, the gunfights are visually dubbed into a lot of high-sticking).

<p>
However, this was before that anti-terrorism Bill C-36 passed on the 19th,
and so now in Canada we have no rights. I think if I cross-check any more
FBI agents I think I'll be hauled off to a military tribunal and tried as
a separatist Quebecois terrorist. Not like that sort of thing hasn't
happened before up here. So in all future correspondance to Italy, please
include the words NOT FOR TERRORISM prominently in the letter, so that
there will be no misunderstanding and nobody will get suspicious. 

<p>
Thank you.

<p>
(BOOB to ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE): A horse, a horse, my kingdom
for a horse...... GET that Fool!!!

<p>
(FOOL to BARON VON BLURBIST): One No-Trump.

<p>
(BARON to PRINZ): Please forgive me. Franze Joseph put
me up to it-he's such a practical joker.

<p>
(BARON to KING ACROSS THE WATERS): Worried as to the
reasons you have not returned any of my messages, I
have hired a local Kiwi to translate my letters to you
into Australian. Normally, he doesn't dabble in such
arcane dialects, but I doubled his pay to four pints.

<p>
(FrOm sWiTzErLaNd): YoU wIlL bUrN. ThIs TiMe FoR sUrE.

<p>
(BOOB to MULTIVERSE): Sigh.... do you think you're playing cryptodip?

<p>
(FOOL to BOOB): Cryptodip? And look who's talking? What, do all our
incomprehensible remarks have to be about baseball?

<p>
(BOOB to SOX FANS): Playing the second sacker in overshift is needed
when Wake's knuckler is dancin' the two step and may hide the fact
that we still ain't signed Pokey yet.

<p>
(BARON to POPE AND SULTAN): Embrace the Luddite Way!
Write, fold, stuff, and stamp!

<p>
(Abuse of yahoo.com): Thank you for reporting your spam problem to us. However, the
email you forwarded appears to be related to an oddly-named Diplomacy game
and not to any internet money-making scheme, so we have taken no action
against the user.

<p>
(BARON to HEATHER): Be a man! Get your own e-mail
account!

<p>
(FOOL to OL' BLIGHTY): I say! Anyone there?

<p>
(BORED IN BELGIUM): 
Seems like we have an awful lot of recovering Judge players in the group.
To those of you who are not that familiar with the judges, this means that
the game consists of successive phases of boring draw reduction ending in
a boring FGx draw. The rest of you fight over the `honour' of being the
third in a 3-way draw. Except England and Austria, you guys are toast I'm
afraid. You can only hope that people will do something interesting
instead, but don't hold your breath.

<p>
(BOOB to EX-JUDGEITES AND VERMONT GROUP SYMPATHIZERS): Three way draw,
what about a FOUR way, where England actually replaces Germany and 
Italy and Russia ``share'' x???
If you guys play ANYWHERE near as whimpy as those Vermont Group Full
Press Championship game lowlifes (ignore those JDPR scores, they are
fakes, all fakes....) I shall never forgive you.
Draw whittling indeed!!!

<p>
QUEERSLAND TO CANADA: 
Oi, what's with all these trans-Pacific threads? They appear to be
attached to cans in Toronto and New South Wales. We tried sending a couple
of ships to the Persian gulf, but they got entangled in them along the
way. So to save face they just turned around and shelled New Zealand
instead. Hope that's alright with you people.

<p>
(BARON to IGOR): Please move a couple hundred miles away
so I get my 34 cents worth.

<p>
(BARON to THE ARCHBISHOP): Forgive me, Father, for I
have sinned. Today I sent four e-mails.

<p>
(ARCHBISHOP to THE BARON): Prithee wasting of thy
sacred mammon.
Thou art forgiven, my son, goest whither knows not
and sin not again any more.

<p>
(BOOB CONTINUES): And this next bit wins my award for best
handwritten note to me of the year, excerpted....

<p>
(CHRIS LOCKHEARDT): A new baby in the house is keeping me from
joining any of the MADip-L group's jaunts to Vermont.
A shame too.
I am sure nobody emerges from six hours in a car with you unchanged
in some fundamental way.
<i>((You'll have to ask Pox about that.... is she perhaps.... cured???
Seriously, gee, I really liked that note!))</i>

<p>
I recently received a sample copy of John Boardman's <i>Graustark</i>.
I am afraid the voracious postal community has caught the scent of me
and is fighting to obtain their fair morsel.
<i>((Indeed, you are about the freshest meat I've seen in many a year.))</i>

<p>
While <i>Graustark</i> is a bit more political than my usual taste,
it certainly was refreshing to cleanse my palate of the endless 
parade of ``God Bless America" and ``These Colors Don't Run!"
bumper stickers that serve as my commuter's reading material.

<p>
In fact, the whole Ashcroft/Rumsfeld ``sit down and shut up'' brand
of Patriotism finally provoked me into doing something I had been
meaning to do ever since Mike Dukakis proudly pulled that card from
him wallet - I joined the ACLU today.
I feel much, much better about myself for doing so.
Enjoy the trip to Vermont!

<p>
(BOOB to EVERYONE): Yes, the trip to Vermont was quite an adventure,
but let me write about it in detail for next issue.
Suffice it to say, I spent ten hours in the car and ten hours playing
Dip that day.....

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Much better and lots of press.... more press, more press....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(IRON DUCK to TSAR JACK): Hmm, yes, well ... we'll uh, be leaving now.  Good 
to see you Cossacks have got your own house in order and installed a 
proper government, eh?  Nice coup there, McHugh, and good that you got 
that quirky Pollard out of the Kremlin.  I'm not know for the ol' 
talky-talk, but Pollard was even quieter than me.  Look forward to working 
with you.  We've left everything as we found it, down to the last babushka 
... peace in our time and all the scheiss the British spew.

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND):  We need to talk.  My bad.

<p>
(BERLIN to LONDON):  A man with a funny accent and a turban has been telling 
me secrets.  These secrets-no-more say you plot against me, and are 
secretly allied with my tormentor, a despised dog who wantonly and without 
provocation subdued fair Munich.  As you can see, I have taken steps to 
avoid an entangling eastern war and to present to you my stronger, 
masculine side, should you chose to test it.  Frankly, I hope we do not 
break ranks, but will rather break Frank heads together.  You are the 
admiral of our destiny  set sail for the stars, sir.  Or at least for 
Bastille.

<p>
(IRON DUCK to YOU BETTER DUCK):  I'm coming to get you, Jimmy ...

<p>
(TURKEY to NEW RUSSIA): We need to talk.  Badly.

<p>
(KIEL to EDINBURGH):  Now that we have a real man in Moscow, we needn't 
secure the Polish border.  In a show of ... uh, solidarnosc with the new 
Tsar, we have unilaterally returned Warsaw to its rightful tyrant ... er, 
owner.  I advise you to show proper respect and avoid the mistake of 
attacking St. Petersburg, est-lay ou-yay issoff-pay he-tay sar-Tay.  I 
think English warships should make haste for the warmer waters of the 
Normandy Coast and the shores of Tripoli.

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY): You need to talk.  Badly.

<p>
(GERMANY to TURKEY):  You know, I think you're trying to cause trouble.  I 
like that in a sick man of Europe.

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): Are you sure that you don't just want to shut him up???

<p>
(MUNICH): You idiot. I said LEFT at Reims. Dang the food Sucks here.

<p>
(WILLIAMS MUSES ALOUD):  Back in the early days of the Hobby, when great 
Edisauruses and Beyerleinicorns and Stegaboardmans roamed the earth, there 
was much press.  And many of the ongoing press storylines evolved and 
revolved around things, personages, and plights Middle-Earthian.  Now, in 
the new millenium, a paltry 40 years after the Hobby's birth, the Lord of 
the Rings has rampaged onto the big screen as it was meant to, in all its 
dark and tremendous glory.  Can the press of a thousand Diplomacy players 
be far behind?  And is there any doubt that Goz gets to be the Balrog?  As 
for me, hey, anyone here speak ent?

<p>
(IRON DUCK to BURGESS AND SULTAN):  Pollard wasn't lost, he was shoved down 
the staircase from behind.  With an oddly sticky dagger protruding from 
his back.  Maple syrup, they think, left on the pommel by someone.  Could 
that someone be Jack the Knife?

<p>
(BOOB to THE ROOM): Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear.
And it shows them, pearly white.....

<p>
(IRON DUCK to THE ROOM):  That's right, folks, I'll be here all week ...

<p>
(BERLIN to PARIS):  I suggest you follow the Emperor and go home with both 
your balls, else you'll be leaving them on the cold cobblestones of a 
strasse somewhere in Munich.  (That would make you a Munich Eunich!)

<p>
CABARET to VIENNA CHOIR:  You guys know a thing or two about eunuchs, eh?

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE): Will you please shut up!

<p>
(BUNDESTADT to MINCING MINARET MINDER): As do you and your ... glandless 
minions, eh?

<p>
(RUHR to RUSSIA &amp; ITALY): And each of you had a secret society at one time 
in the past that practiced a ritual self-castrastion ... I Castrati in 
Italy, and I forget what they were called in Russia; they were part of 
Rasputin's cult ...

<p>
(IRON DUCK to SUNSTORMER):  ... meaning we're the only two here with any ... 
sense.

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA): You need to talk before the deadline.

<p>
(GERMANY to FRANCE): Of all the beer joints in all the world and you had to 
walk into mine.  You two-timer!  I thought you said we'd always have 
Paris.  I'm very hurt.  Play it again, Jim ...

<p>
(JUMPIN' GM JIMBO AT THE PIANO): Sing us a song, you're the piano man ...

<p>
(IRON DUCK to JIM): Not that song ... our song, her song ... you that one 
that I told you never to play ... play it, play it damn you!

<p>
(JUMPIN' GM JIMBO AT THE PIANO): Once I was a boogie singer, playin' in a 
rock and roll band ...

<p>
(TURKEY to ITALY): Why did you stop talking?

<p>
(60's FLASHBACK): ``I've lost my harmonica, Albert ... "  (I'll buy a 
sixpack for the first player here who can identify the artist and song. 

<p>
(BOOB to LESS MUSICALLY MINDED): Think about a sequence of four herbs....
no, not Herbie Hancock.....
I'll take my sixpack off the air....

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): NOW can we find out about Kent Pollard?
Thanks Jim-Bob!  Happy Holidays!

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): I got your ``Christmas letter'', very, very funny.....
I especially liked the part about the Arena Football game.
As for Mr. Pollard, I do seem to have misplaced his note, but 
essentially he is very, very busy and doesn't have time for us anymore.
Oh well..... I told him he should return when he isn't so busy, but
I'm not hopeful.
In a few years, I'll have to add him to a search.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The seven way DIAS draw is fails.
A GATE draw, which will close the gate on this game, 
is now proposed.
But, even GREATer than that is the GREAT draw, which also is
proposed.
Please vote on them with your Winter orders.
If you fail to vote, they cannot pass.

<p>
2) Randy Ellis resigns with these orders, I hope Bob Acheson will be
willing to replace him.

<p>
3) Thanks to Rick Davis for playing out this position to the bitter end!
He went down fighting to the last.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(OFFICIAL GERMAN PRESS (unlike that phony German press last time)):
The Kaiser officially condemns the use of any slang in the allegedly 
``German press" of the last issue of TAP. It is clear that some zines 
<i>((That must be SZINES!!!
You, sir, fail the linguistic test.))</i>
have no viable linguistic standards whatsoever for the press that 
appears in them. However, the One True Kaiser hereby votes for 
any DIAS proposal whatsoever as long as it doesn't include Austria.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Since there seems to be some confusion about where everyone is
here, I'm reprinting the corrected Fall adjudication and asking
again for Autumn and Winter orders for the next deadline.
Below we reprint the game notes and press from the last season.
I have proper orders in hand from all but one of you and will
keep them on file.
The one whose orders I don't have knows who he is.
But I did say that one request was sufficient to delay the 
Winter adjudication.
Apologies again for causing the confusion.

<p>
2) Thank you very much to Hank Alme and Robert Stimmel for playing
out their respective positions.
We are now down to six players.
I'm sure about that, but please check the rest of the Supply Center
Chart carefully, there were lots of changes and I'm not sure I
kept up with all of them properly.

<p>
3) Mega-apologies for misplacing an order revision from Paul
Rauterberg.
The new results are up above, note that England has one less
center, Austria has one more, as a result.
I also made a few other minor corrections, so again, check me
carefully.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
             
<p>
(CHINA-RUSSIA): I think I'd be more comfortable in the Bay of Bengal.

<b>EDWARD TELLER: 2001?rn42, Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire
Diplomacy - Black Hole Variant</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p> <b>GAME WILL START NOW!!!</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) John Schultz (begins with Austria), Paul Rauterberg (begins with England), 
Karl Muller (begins with France), Harry Andruschak (begins with Germany), Lee Kendter, Jr. (begins with Italy), 
Jack McHugh (begins with Russia), and Sandy Kenny (begins with Turkey) are 
on board and playing.
See the rules below.
Please make sure that I have your correct and updated contact information.
Karl, is your E-Mail address still kmuller of gelmanpension.com??
And Sandy, do you have a separate E-Mail address from Paul's
at pdkenny of net-gate.com??
I think I have everyone else's contact info right and everyone
else's address appears elsewhere in this issue except for Lee's
which is lkendter of speakeasy.net.
The official, official game start will come next issue when I am 
sure that I have everyone's info, but you obviously have enough
to get started now.
I am thinking that Spring 1901 (when the big action happens)
will be due March 16th, let me know if you really want it earlier
and if you have any questions about the rules.
Unless superceded below, all rules are as in regular Diplomacy.

<p>
2) The game lasts seven game years (measured Winter to Winter, 1901 to 1907), 
with each player rotating through the powers in alphabetical order (AEFGIRT),
playing each power for one game year.  At the end of each game
year, the game board and positions are fully reset to the initial
positions.

<p>
3) Initial Positions: All units and supply center ownership are as in
regular Diplomacy, except that each player has five nuclear weapons
(except for Russia which has only four nuclear weapons).

<p>
4) Firing Nuclear Weapons: Each nuclear weapon (nuke) is fired 
at a specific province (land or sea) according to 
orders submitted by their owners immediately FOLLOWING the Spring
moves (nuke orders are submitted with those moves and cannot be made
conditional on any outcomes or moves in the Spring turn).
Nuclear weapon strikes destroy the supply center in the targeted
province, if any, as well as any units in that province following
the Spring turn.

<p>
5) Effects of Nuclear Weapons (Black Hole Variant): The effects of
the nuclear weapon strike are equivalent to those in the Black
Hole variant designed by Conrad von Metzke (Conrad is the unofficial
ombudsman for adjudication of paradoxes caused by this rule).
Any provinces adjacent to a nuke strike province are now themselves
adjacent.
The effect of nuke strikes on adjacent provinces creates a cumulative
effect such that all provinces adjacent to an a contiguous string of
nuke strike provinces are all simultaneously adjacent.
This effect applies to moves, supports, retreats, and convoys.
Coastal provinces that are nuked transmit their coastal status to
all adjacent provinces, which also is cumulative in effect.
These coastal status changes do not interfere with any army supports,
retreats, or moves between two land provinces separated by
a contiguous string of nuke strike provinces.

<p>
6) Victory Conditions: The game ends at the end of the seventh winter
adjustment season.
Victory points are garnered by cumulatively adding supply centers owned
at the end of each of the seven game years.
The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.
Ties are broken by sequentially comparing victory points owned in
1907 followed by each preceding year.
Players earning precisely the same number of victory points in each
of the seven game years remain tied.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Thanks to everyone for a fun game!
I'll do stats on ALL the delayed games next time and get caught up
and then you can send me endgame statements if you like.

<p>
2) Sorry again that I lost the note from Kent Pollard, Mark Kinney took 
over the position with gusto, though not perhaps the gusto some might
have wished.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY to FRANCE):  I got two bucks that say that YOU voted down your own 
concession.

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA):  I'll bet you fifty Ishkibibbles that Italy is 
taking Sevastopol.  So I'm taking the Great Powers who have caused the 
most problems for Turkey out of the draw with this move.

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): Come and get me, Froggy!

<p>
(FRANCE): I hope this works.  
If it doesn't it looks like this game may be locked down.  But maybe not.  
I am way bummed out about George Harrison right now. (he died yesterday)  
I have been watching the shows about his life.  The TV anchors keep saying 
a deranged fan attacked and stabbed him in the chest in 1999.  
Don't you lose your ``fan" status when you try to kill some one?  
But back to the game.  Kinney, you chucklehead.  
Why don't you reply to players when you just join?  
Sheeesh. We all know Emmert is the evil one.  
If my memory serves right, he was involved in some very shady dealings 
in Bolivia last June.  
Let's see what else can I ramble about?  
I am greatly tempted to just go on and on and see how much of this drivel 
that Jim-Bob will let me sneak in, but I won't tempt fate.
<i>((You KNOW my drivel quotient is quite high, you could have gone on
for at least a page without bothering me.....))</i>
GIVE ME THE RESULTS JIM O ROONIE!!!!!!!!!!!!  

<p>
(TURKEY to AUS-HUN):  Sorry that this costs you a piece of a three-way 
draw if you and Steve play it as I think you might.  But your 
predecessor joined me in an I-A-T early then declared a jihad on me. 
His play caused your nation and mine to exchange massive casualties and 
end up exiled from our homelands by Italians.

<p>
(BOOB to WORLD): Let's finish up with another edition of Emmert
on Sports.... this time football finds his fancy....

<p>
(EMMERT ON SPORTS): Obviously, I am WAY overdue if I want 
to give you a hockey report; let's go with the World Cup draw instead.

<p>
GROUP A -
France, Denmark, Uruguay, Senegal -
The French get out of this group easily.  The sensible bet is probably 
on the Danes to join them in the second round, but I'll go with Uruguay, 
which has a suffocating defense.

<p>
GROUP B -
Spain, Slovenia, Paraguay, South Africa -
I think this is a fascinating group, and I can see any of the four sides 
making it through.  In any case, Spain should make it.  Paraguay's best 
player, goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, is currently suspended for the 
first two matches.  If FIFA reduces the suspension from four to two 
games (which he's already served), then I wouldn't be surprised at all 
to see Paraguay make it through to the second round.  South Africa is 
probably the best rounded African team, and if Paraguay falters, I'll go 
with them them for the next round.

<p>
GROUP C -
Brazil, China, Turkey, Costa Rica -
Brazil had an unexpectedly difficult time qualifying for the finals this 
year, but many pundits are still picking them to go all the way.  They 
have enormous talent, but in my view, they don't mesh well.  That won't 
keep them from moving on to the second round, but they're not the 
dominant team they have been in years past.  China's great 
accomplishment was just qualifying for this tournament; they are serious 
contenders to finish last in the 32-team field.  Costa Rica should give 
Turkey a fight, but the Turks are really the stronger side, and should 
make it through; I can see them making some noise in the later rounds of 
the finals.

<p>
GROUP D -
Portugal, Poland, South Korea, USA -
No one here can hang with the Portuguese, one of the great teams in the 
world.  Luis Figo is probably one of the five best players on the planet 
right now, and it's probable that none of the other teams in this group 
can match up with Portugal's firepower.  The Americans have at least a 
decent chance of getting through, though they'll have to deal with a 
probable opening game loss to Portugal, and come from behind against the 
other two sides.  I see Korea's becoming one of the few host teams to 
fail to make the second round; look for Poland to move on.

<p>
GROUP E -
Germany, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Cameroon -
Germany, too, struggled to qualify, but find themselves one of the top 
eight seeds, due to FIFA's complicated seeding process.  They're almost 
certainly the strongest side in this group.  Cameroon will entertain, 
but probably doesn't have the depth to keep up with the Saudis or 
Ireland.  I'd love to see the Irish in the second round, but I have a 
hunch that the Saudis will make it through.

<p>
GROUP F -
Argentina, Sweden, England, Nigeria -
Here is this year's Group of Death.  There isn't a weak side anywhere to 
be found.  England are looking forward to redemption against Argentina, 
and should get by Sweden and Nigeria for the other slot in the second 
round.  I see the Argentines as winning this group, but there will be 
blood on the scoreboard.
<i>((I'm sure all of our English subbers to this szine are crying 
in their pints over this one.))</i>

<p>
GROUP G - 
Italy, Croatia, Ecuador, Mexico -
If Group F is the Group of Death, this is the Group of Intensive Care.  
Again, all four sides are quite capable of moving on.  I'm going with 
Italy and Mexico.  Ecuador have never been to the finals before; Croatia 
don't have the talent of the Italians, and will probably succumb to 
Mexico's offensive push.

<p>
GROUP H - 
Japan, Belgium, Russia, Tunisia - 
I really think this is a free pass into the second round for Russia.  
Belgium are very strong, especially with the return of Michael Wilmots 
from a leg injury, but the Russians should win this group, perhaps 
winning all three first round games.  The Belgians should also qualify, 
though Japan could surprise people and sneak into the next round.

<p>
My early picks were Italy and Argentina in the finals.  A great many 
experts are tabbing France to repeat, and it's hard to bet against the 
defending champions and the current #1 side in the world.  But I say 
Juan Sebastien Veron carries Argentina through to the championship over 
a talented Italian side.

<p>
Knowing you, Jim-Bob, you'll save this and reprint it next June, when 
the finals are underway.  That's okay; I can take the heat, even if 
Nigeria kicks Argentina right out of the finals.  
<i>((Wrongo, Ambulance Chaser breath!!!  I'm right with you on this.)</i>
Best wishes.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
3) Everybody regroups, except for Diamond, who had few other good choices,
since if he had ``broken away'' he only would have broken away to a three
card.
And check out those cards Alice has garnered!!
Where's that press??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WHITE MAID to ERIC):  When ya follow a cyclist in the rain, ya gotta
expect a bit of mud in the water in the face...

<p>
(ERIC to WHITE MAID):  It seems like I was pedaling in my sleep.  A little
water in the face helps wake a person up.

<p>
(ERIC to BOOB):  In old zines people would write ``what if'' pieces about
Diplomacy games on nationwide TV.  How many of them imagined the current
situation, where we actually <i>do </i> have a string of what are effectively
Diplomacy games on nationwide TV?

<p>
(BOOB to ERIC): I don't know, but as far as I am concerned, NONE of them
is as good as THE game.
I think they could make Diplomacy into a better made for TV event than any
of them if it were done right.
They would have to put some ``socializing'' into it so that the players could
get to know each other and the TV audience could see that as well.
All negotiations would be filmed and then results would be edited to catch the
juiciest lies and best intrigue.
A map could be superimposed on the screen so that as people were talking
a ``John Madden" type could be pointing out the moves they were talking
about on a telestrator.
People would enter their orders into a computer that would instantly make
the moves at adjudication time
with some flashy color (Hasbro did have a bit of the right idea
there) for attacks and dislodgements.
You would need expert commentary used VERY judiciously, since the main
point would be to listen to the players and the negotiations.
They, of course, would be playing for a whole hell of a lot of money.
A whole complete show played out to the end could be eight one hour 
episodes or so.  
A continuous series would just start a new game when the last one ended.
Winners might even be allowed to come back and play again, either in
a winners round, or against six new players.
