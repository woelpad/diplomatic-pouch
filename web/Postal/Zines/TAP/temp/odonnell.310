Regular Diplomacy game list. I also would like to be removed from the Nuke 
game list.

star trek press; 7of 9s  log; down but not out! "i thought it was over so much so that i had made calculations to escape to my last reality with captain kirk. things are still pretty bleak here. earth and mars are occupied by the kardasians and vulcan is under seige. on top of that i've been forced to decomission  a troop transport. on the other hand thru my diplomatic effort i have received help from of all people the grand negus  (good thing he is not holding a grudge) and the andorians. toghether we managed to blow up a kardasian transport with the loss of all hands (die kardasian scum...) , defend vulcan(barley) and as a result of the battle one of our transports occupies a  kardasian world called thesness 3. in addition  the andorians are occupieing kardassia prime. i don't know what makes gul ducaut more nausieating, the fact that he can't be trusted or his bumbling incopitence. of course i can't talk after i ran the federation in this universe into the dirt but i can at least try to take down the kardasians with me, 7 out".......

startrek press;"breathing room"  a conversation kirk K, spock S, and lt. uhura U,
spock on the bridge looking at his sensor monitor not beleiving his eyes...
S captain,this is curious, i can't pick up any sign of the romulans in the neutral zone. 
K is it possible that our tackion scans are no loger effective at detecting a cloaked ship?
S i don't think so. we can still detect 3 birds of prey in the andoran neutral zone although we have no idea as to there exact location or destination. they are there. also they have abandoned deep space 2. 
K what do you make of it?
S it can mean only one thing captain. our gorn allies have put up a briiliant fight but they are losing badly to the tomarians. also  the tomarians have  2 galaxy class  starships 3 light years from mars and deep space one. they are no longer needed to defeat the gorn. the romulans are either very stupid or they have made a deal with the tomarians and as you know captain the romulans are many things but stupid isn't one of them. they have fought us to hard to just quit  ( suddenly lt.uhuras station starts beaping, kirk and spock look at the lutenent )
U captain i'm getting a message from commander worf from his hiding place in exile on the planet grafton.
he's sending us data for a new and improved communications array and tactical suggestions as how to deal best with the romulan/tomarian threat.
S facsinating, aparantly mr worf has been monitoring our situation to kill time during his exile.
K any chance the data will help?
S the array will probably help us to communicate more effeciently with everyone and may even help us talk to Q.
K why would we want to? 
S good point. 
K maybee his tactical ideas will help.
S they better because as it stands right now the tomarians are projected to to take over this universe and if whats left of the gorn are forced to join them then...
K we better learn to speak tomarian!!!
S considering that there language is not comprehendable by the universal translator i'd say thats not likley.
( as the bad trek music starts playing kirk and spock just sit there contemplating )

jim;please give all of the games my  e-mail address, unclestaush@yahoo.com
