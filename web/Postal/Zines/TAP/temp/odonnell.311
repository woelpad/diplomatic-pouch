star trek press 7 of 9s log. having sent a tactical
plan to the andorians and the ferengies for our joint
effort against the now crumbling kardasians the plan
wuz analized by the ferengie allie the packletts, an
annoying race who are much smarter then they lead
everyone to believe. they noticed a flaw in my plan
suggesting that it would put the enterprize at risk
and that could be long term critical as we are the
only allied starship this deep into kardasian space
other the kardassians  dominion allies. its possible
we may have turned a corner here. too bad we dont
pozzes a cloak.we have adjusted our stratagy thanks to
the packletts.7 out...
jeff to jim; my idiot indians were in new york against
the evil empirethis week.  the winning run iz on 2nd
base with first base open  in the bottom of the 9th
with arrod up. our guiniuss manager eric wedge decides
to let our journyman closer scott borowski pitch to
him rather then walking him and he hits a walk off
home run. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! i mean what in the
name of mike hargrove iz goin on here! have i ever
mentioned that i hate the yankees...
hey jim; i have an idea for the name of the new modern
game; "fear and sleep deprivation"
