Hi Jim,

Thanks so much for DW #96 and TAP #310, plus the fantastic news! I will be honored to write an intro for DW #100. It is hard to believe that it has been 1/3 a century since DW started.

That is also neat that you found Jeff Key. Could you give me his and Edi Birsan's email? I saw Edi probably 20 years ago in the Bay area, but I'll bet is it 30 since I saw Jeff last.

Thanks again!
Walt

Hi Walt, no, John does not use E-Mail, and he is in good health.
You could drop him a postal line, his address hasn't changed,
though I don't have it handy here, let me know if you want it.

I still have an original Graustark #1! It was Derek Nelson's copy. 44 years is an amazing record. And I think over 800 issues.
