Jim-Bob,

=20

I'm on the road again these last two weeks, but did finally see TAP #311
on-line.  It appears that you lost not just my email of 5 April with my
take on the 2007 baseball season (I'll send it below in hopes of getting
it into your szine before Labor Day) but also my email of 14 April with
my take on steroids, Hugo Chavez and Thomas the Tank Engine.

=20

Don't you love me or my ramblings anymore?

=20

The good news is that my new company got a huge order to sell
Mine-Resistant, Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to the Marines & Army.
The bad news is that I get to spend more than half my time in
Mississippi and less than half playing trains with Nathan.  I guess it
beats unemployment.

=20

See my two previous emails below.  Do what you will with them.  Their
dreams are shattered anyway.

Subject: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of sports

=20

Jim-Bob,

=20

As promised, here's my take on life, liberty, and the pursuit of sports.
This email is likely to be written in several shifts and will probably
seem a bit disorganized and disconnected.  Try to read it and NOT think
of the name, "Scott Morris".

=20

Topic #1:  Ok, I've been a little slow to respond to something that you
mentioned last October.  Maybe I'll use that to start with this analogy:
there's a bigger penalty for driving without a driver's license than
there is for driving over the speed limit.  This is probably because
it's a lot harder to catch someone driving without a legal right than
there is to catch someone speeding.  So it is with baseball and their
penalties (bet you wondered where THIS was going).  For things that the
umps OUGHT to be able to catch you at, like having pine tar on your
hand, or Vaseline in your glove, there isn't the penalty that there is
for steroids, which is a lot harder to catch at game time.  I think this
is correct.  Same too with Hall of Fame induction.  Yeah, we've got more
than a few pitchers that have, shall we say, gotten around the rules as
written DURING the game and haven't gotten caught and yet still have a
bust in Cooperstown.  But it's the times where you CAN'T catch them that
concerns me, and apparently concerns MLB as well.

=20

This does not mean that MLB hasn't been complicit in their approach to
chemical cheating over the years.  But the union is going to have to
cave in on testing for steroids, HGH, illegal supplements and
subscriptions to TAP (mind-altering...and nearly impossible to detect in
the dugout) if I want to be able to tell my kid "don't do this, it won't
get you anywhere" with a straight face.

=20

Topic Shift:  Speaking of Hall of Fame, it's a shame that the whole
steroid cloud took away from the election of Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripkin,
Jr., and that McGwire got more publicity than both of them combined.
Both guys had, obviously, great careers, and I think that Gwynn's will
be looked at as even greater as the years go by.  It's actually a curse
to be just a West Coast player during your career, as you won't ever get
a fair shake by the national media.

=20

Topic shift:  Hugo Chavez has proclaimed a "21st century Socialist
Revolution" in Venezuela.  I predict that they will have an oil shortage
there by 2012.

=20

Topic shift:  There are times when you look at your TV and remember why
you became a sports' fan.  Sometimes these times take mere seconds, such
as when Argentina scored against Mexico in last year's World Cup on a
great cross-field pass where the forward bounced the ball off his chest,
then left-footed it to the far upper corner without it hitting the
ground.  Sometimes these times last a couple of minutes.  The
Dodgers/Padres game last year where the Dodgers hit 4 straight homers to
tie it in the bottom of the 9th and then win in extra innings, or the
last 4 laps of the 2006 Indy 500, where the lead changed twice from an
Andretti to an Andretti to another damn Penske driver (side note:  think
of Andretti vs. Penske at Indy as Red Sox vs. Yankees...1 win for an
Andretti in 1969, 15 wins for Penske since, so Mario V is due in 2055).
Sometimes the times you're glad to be a sports' fan last the entire
event.  Such a time recently was the Fiesta Bowl the night of 1 January
2007 between Oklahoma and Boise St.  Throw away the Hollywood-style
ending, where the Boise St. running back takes the handoff on a
Statue-of-Liberty play to score the winning 2-point conversion in
overtime (43-42), then proposes to his cheerleader girlfriend on the
sideline.  This was a game where the little guy looked across the line
at the big guy for the whole game and didn't blink, and one that will
hopefully bring College Football to its senses and gives them a rational
playoff system where the deserving get a shot at the national title.  I
would have liked to have likened this to George Mason's run through the
2006 basketball tourney, but as we've seen that did nothing to get the
little guys into the 2007 basketball tourney.

=20

Topic shift:  Having a 4-year-old son gives you a new perspective on
life.  I certainly watch less sports than I used to (although I see this
changing), and I have to learn to take children's television with a
grain of salt.  One of Nathan's favorites is "Thomas the Tank Engine"
which, if you've never seen it, is about a railway on a mythical Island
of Sodor, which has a distinct British accent.  Having watched dozens of
episodes I can conclude without fear of contradiction that the Island of
Sodor has no effective National Transportation Safety Board (phrase most
often heard on the show:  "luckily no one was hurt").

=20

Topic shift:  Nathan has hit the lottery.  We live in a new subdivision
on a street with 15 houses, 2 of which are not yet occupied.  Of the
remaining 13 houses there are a total of 27 kids including Nathan.  5 of
the other 26 are boys his age (plus one girl his age who is a twin of
one of the boys).  If all the fathers start now (and a referendum for a
new high school passes) we can probably have the starting lineup of St.
Charles West's high school's basketball team residing on the block in
2019.  Nathan will probably be the shooting guard, as he's not going to
be big enough to be inside and has little inclination to play defense.

=20

Topic shift:  Having written in to TAP for 10 years now I felt it time
to re-evaluate where I stand on things that I write, since for some
reason you actually feel them important enough to print.  So I thought
about the whole concept of "team sports".  I don't get enough time to
memorize the entire rosters of too many teams any more, as some of the
things that I have acquired in the last 10 years include a wife, son and
mortgage.  So I get down on team sports because the faces change too
often.  Nonetheless, I found myself coming up with a list of the top 5
teams that I actually root for.

=20

#1:  Chicago Cubs.  Fan since 1967.  Last WS title 1908.  Last NL title
1945.  And they won't win another one any time soon.  Piniella can
infuse new life into them to make a run at the NL Central, which is
awful, but realistically they're 2 pitchers, 2 infielders and an
outfielder from being a legitimate threat.  But I have hopes.

=20

#2:  Chicago Blackhawks.  Fan since 1967.  Last title 1960.  No chance
for one any time soon, as the owner won't put any money into them (you
can't even see the home games on TV).  They actually gave me a little
hope for their first playoff spot in 10 years until they lost 10 in a
row in December though.

=20

#3:  University of Illinois football.  Fan since 1976.  Last Big 10
title, 2001, before that 1984.  This is how it should be.  They win
titles about as often as the statistics say they should.

=20

#4:  Indianapolis Colts.  Fan since 1984.  Last title, February 2007.
This item would have come off better had I written the note before the
playoffs started, as I'd planned.  But they were fun to watch, even
though I'm not in Indy any more.  It also shows that small markets can
win in the NFL, and they really don't have to be managed all that well.

=20

#5:  Jack Roush Racing.  Fan since 1993.  Titles in 2003 & 2004.  Ok,
it's tough to root for a NASCAR team that doesn't go back to the 50s.
But Jack Roush is a pretty cool guy, and is one of the best "hands-on"
owners in sports.  The only downside is that this year he merged with
John Henry and the other owners of the Boston Red Sox to become
"Roush-Fenway Racing", so he won't win another title until 2090.

=20

Of those five, the only one I really care about is the Cubs.  There is
something still charming about them.  Maybe it's the ballpark with the
Ivy and the Scoreboard.  Maybe it's the "loveable loser" concept.  Maybe
I'm just old.  But now even Nathan will make sure we're watching to sing
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in the 7th.  It makes baseball worthwhile
in April when it's cold, and August when they're out of contention.

=20

One curious note is that White Sox fans (my wife, for example) often ask
me how bad I feel that their team won in 2005.  I really don't care that
they won in 2005.  The White Sox are NOT the Cubs' rivals.  The
Cardinals are.  So 2006 was a real bummer.

=20

With team sports just not being what it has been for me, I find myself
rooting for & against individuals.  This is a lot easier in racing or
golf, as you get to see them interviewed a lot more often than other
athletes, so you get a handle on their personalities better than you can
when you only see A-Rod/Tom Brady/T-Mac/Sidney Crosby get 5 seconds on
Sportscenter.  In thinking on it, racers and golfers usually have an
incentive to be interviewed, as they're walking billboards.  Maybe
baseball players would be a little more fan-friendly if their contract
included wearing something they had to peddle.  Hmmm...

=20

In the last 48 hours I became a fan of one David Moss.  For those of you
who haven't heard of him (and that's ALL of you) he plays center on the
4th line of the Calgary Flames.  I have just started a new job, and Mr.
Moss is the nephew of one of my new coworkers.  As we've all been on
travel in the middle of nowhere (West Point, MS) for the last few weeks
we had a bonding session in one of our rooms with a few pizzas, some
beers, and Game 1 of the Calgary-Detroit series.  The Red Wings won 4-1,
and the highlight of the game was when the camera panned to David Moss
on the bench, then to his parents and brother in the stands, as my
coworker said, "That's my wife's brother in the ugly hat".

=20

As I said above, I've acquired new gainful employment (as of 19 March),
trying to get armored vehicles to the military so they can send them
someplace.  I'm learning how to build trucks, and I'm teaching my
employers how to build military trucks.  I think that's all I'm allowed
to say about it other than it's pretty cool, it pays the bills pretty
well, and it has put me in West Point, MS for 4 of the last 5 weeks.
I'll probably have more time to write in to you as I'm spending a lot
less time pounding the pavement, even though I'm usually someplace I
can't get a wireless connection.

=20

There's probably a few things that I've forgotten here but it's taken me
a week to get this far, so I'll sign off so I can send this tonight, and
promise that I'll send things more often.  Really.  Would I lie to you?
Heck, I'll even support you into Rumania.

&gt; Gentlemen (well, in theory anyway),<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sorry for the delay.&nbsp; I have acquired new gainful employment, =
which
has<br>
&gt; necessitated my being gone for 2 of the first 3 weeks of it, with a =
repeat<br>
&gt; in the next 3 weeks.&nbsp; Someplace fun?&nbsp; Uh, no.&nbsp; =
<st1:place
w:st=3D"on"><st1:City w:st=3D"on">West Point</st1:City>, <st1:State =
w:st=3D"on">MS</st1:State></st1:place>,
if you want<br>
&gt; to look it up (took me 10 hours to get home today).&nbsp; I did get =
to
stay at<br>
&gt; a condo at the Old Waverly Golf Course, where the Women's US Open =
was<br>
&gt; played in '98.&nbsp; Had I actually been there when the sun was up =
I'd
probably<br>
&gt; have told you it was pretty.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; On to more important matters, even if it's too late for the current =
TAP.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; First off, let's just agree that every team has a flaw.&nbsp; More =
and
more, as<br>
&gt; with the NFL, it's just better to pick the teams that have the most =
going<br>
&gt; for them and ignore the warts.&nbsp; Ok, maybe it isn't, but that's =
what
I'm<br>
&gt; going with.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; AL East:&nbsp; Rick, consider yourself laughed at for your deluded
optimism,<br>
&gt; just not as hard as you might think.&nbsp; It looks to me like the =
balance
of<br>
&gt; power has shifted dramatically to this division for the league, and =
the <st1:State
w:st=3D"on"><st1:place w:st=3D"on">AL</st1:place></st1:State><br>
&gt; is the better league.&nbsp; I think it's Yankees, Red Sox, Orioles, =
Blue
Jays,<br>
&gt; Devil Rays, and the Blue Jays might be .500.&nbsp; <st1:City =
w:st=3D"on"><st1:place
 w:st=3D"on">Boston</st1:place></st1:City> gets the WC with 96<br>
&gt; wins.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; AL Central:&nbsp; This division is either really good or really =
mediocre.<br>
&gt; <st1:City w:st=3D"on"><st1:place =
w:st=3D"on">Detroit</st1:place></st1:City>'s
young arms won't bounce back this year...count on it.&nbsp; They'll<br>
&gt; be good, but it's a 4-team race, and all 4 might be in the 81-88 =
win<br>
&gt; range. But I'll pick Indians, Tigers, White Sox, Twins, =
Royals.&nbsp;
White Sox<br>
&gt; go 81-81, 7 games back.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; AL West:&nbsp; I think the Angles and A's took a big dive.&nbsp; =
Rangers,
Angels,<br>
&gt; A's, Mariners, and the Angels don't make .500.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; NL East:&nbsp; Once again, the balance has shifted here, but not =
quite as
much<br>
&gt; as in the <st1:State w:st=3D"on"><st1:place =
w:st=3D"on">AL</st1:place></st1:State>.&nbsp;
As <st1:City w:st=3D"on"><st1:place =
w:st=3D"on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City> did
NOT win the division last year I am no<br>
&gt; longer contractually obligated to pick them to win it this =
year.&nbsp;
However,<br>
&gt; I still think they're pretty good, and good enough for the =
WC.&nbsp; Mets,<br>
&gt; Braves, Phillies, Marlins, Nats.&nbsp; Phillies win 85 games, =
Marlins 79.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; NL Central:&nbsp; This division got worse on paper and in reality, =
but the<br>
&gt; Cards will have a better record than last year, which means =
little.<br>
&gt; Cards, Cubs, Astros, Reds, Brewers, Pirates.&nbsp; Cubs go 76-86, =
11 games<br>
&gt; back.&nbsp; Anyone found picking the Brewers for this division will =
be
drug<br>
&gt; tested.&nbsp; Ain't happening.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; NL West:&nbsp; Toughest call here.&nbsp; First, let me predict that =
Barry
Bonds will<br>
&gt; cause a controversy sometime this season.&nbsp; Then I'll say
Diamondbacks,<br>
&gt; Dodgers, Giants, Padres, <st1:place =
w:st=3D"on">Rockies</st1:place>.&nbsp;
Giants might be within 5 games.<br>
&gt; <st1:State w:st=3D"on"><st1:place =
w:st=3D"on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>
goes 88-74.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Playoffs:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Red Sox over Rangers<br>
&gt; Yankees over Indians<br>
&gt; Mets over Cards<br>
&gt; Braves over Diamondbacks<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; LCS:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yankees over Red Sox<br>
&gt; Mets over Braves<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; WS:<br>

&gt; Better read that again.<br>
