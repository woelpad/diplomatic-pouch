Invitational-only (so I couldn't bring my workplace or weekend people), 
KniziaKon hosted a bunch of folks for 192 plays of 108 different games, 
including 44 different Reiner Knizia games.  (Knizia is the designer of 
TAJ MAHAL, INGENIOUS, TIGRIS & EUPHRATES, LOST CITIES, MEDICI, MODERN 
ART, RA, THROUGH THE DESERT, TRAUMFABRIK, and other notable games.  This 
con emphasized casual play of his games, but was otherwise for casual 
play of darn near any strategy games including one or two collectible 
card games.) 

Lots of friends including a few from the 1980s.  First time I'd seen 
Steve Hutton in fifteen years.  I was there Friday noonish until Monday 
noonish and played two dozen games without trying hard.  For example of 
not gaming every waking moment, I took two decent-length hikes and 
several short ones.  On one of the hikes at the Martin Van Buren Trails, 
I saw a nesting pair of hawks drive off a larger group of other birds... 
peregrine falcons, possibly... who were trying to chase them out or kill 
their eggs.  Noisy, impressive.

At the same house the previous New Year, I won a game (a short 
pirate-themed card game) at 11:59 pm on 31-Dec, the last finish of the 
old year.  This time, I won a game of ZUM KUCKUCK!, a short 
cockatoo-themed card game, at 12:01 am on 1-Jan, the first finish of the 
new year.  Woo hoo!

I had only two repeats, so there were 22 different titles, including 8 
designed by Reiner Knizia:
- Grand National Derby [Piotnik Games], 4 players, learned, Knizia : 
steeplechase horse racing, bet on horses and play cards, worst horse at 
each fence is eliminated.
- Money! [Gold Sieber Games], 5 players, Knizia : set collecting among 
several types of currencies, with an interesting mechanic: bid some of 
your cards, players choose in high-to-low-bid order to swap the bid 
cards for one of two groups on the table or for another player's bid cards.
- Medici [Amigo Spiele], 5 players, Knizia : classic abstract Eurogame, 
auction of cards of five colors, bonuses for winning each color and for 
best total card value.
- Crokinole, 4 players in 2 teams, won : disk-flicking game on a wood 
board with bumpers, trying to get your disks into a hole in the middle, 
simple rules give enough strategy to make it more than flick-skill exercise.
- Gheos [Z-Man Games], 4 players, learned : a build/merge/split game 
somewhat like Java or Taluva, with a military element.  Less fiddly and 
more actiony than most similar games like those named or LASS DIE KIRCHE 
INS DORF.
- Settlers of Catan, on 3-D set with miniatures sculpted by Klaus 
Teuber, 4 players, won : plain vanilla Settlers except the big fancy 
board and pieces.  Pretty, but I'm told that kind of resin shatters if 
you drop it.
- Yspahan [Y'stari Games], 4 players : roll a bunch of dice, players 
choose them for resources or buildings or improvements or caravans with 
a vague theme and little interaction.
- City and Guilds [JKLM Games], 3 players, learned, won : tile placement 
with a medieval city-building theme, seemed more interesting than 
Carcassonne for our tastes.
- Ticket to Ride: USA 1910, Mega Game [Days of Wonder], 3 players : All 
the old and new ticket cards, more tickets when you draw, both bonuses 
(longest road and most fulfilled tickets).
- Ta Yu [Rio Grande Games], 2 players, taught : Just pipe-connecting 
tile-laying like dominoes, but so much strategic richness in such a 
simple set of rules.  My favorite game to teach to non-gamers.
- Stephenson's Rocket [Rio Grande Games], 4 players, Knizia : railroad 
building in Britain, merging like Acquire, but very much a Knizia game 
in having multiple ways to earn points.
- Taj Mahal [Rio Grande Games], 5 players, Knizia : ingenious 
card-driven six simultaneous auctions, multiple ways to score, theme is 
political jockeying in India.
- Ta Yu again, 2 players : one of just two games that I repeated.
- Too Many Cooks [R&R Games], 4 players, learned, Knizia : a 
trick-taking card game where players are trying to make the best soup of 
various types.
- Alhambra [Queen Games] with 3 expansions from expansion box 3, 5 
players, learned expansions : we tried the City Walls, Thieves, and 
Change variants.  City Walls adds tiles letting you add extra walls to 
your current tiles on specific tile sides.  Thieves lets you steal a 
particular color of the face-up money cards twice a game.  Change gives 
you a random color's $1 coin for every $2 overpayment, helping you make 
exact change later.  All seem to be interesting additions to the basic 
game.  I liked these better than the four in TheVizier's Favor (box 1): 
moneychangers, huts, play out of turn, bonus cards for particular buildings.
- Can't Stop [Parker Brothers], 3 players : outdoor on a picnic table on 
New Year's Eve!  dice-rolling push-your-luck silliness.
- Einfach Genial [Kosmos], 4 players, taught, Knizia : You guys know 
this as Ingenious.  Tiles covering two hexes, each hex has one of six 
colors, play one tile from a Scrabble-rack of six, and score points for 
hexes of the same color in straight lines all directions away from the 
new tile's two hexes.  Your worst color (not your best color or total 
score) determines whether you win the game.  A big score for you may 
risk a bigger score for the next player, but you might be able to keep 
an opponent from scoring in his worst color.  Plenty of strategy in a 
fairly simple game.
- Underground [JKLM Games / Rio Grande Games], 4 players, learned : On a 
map of the London Underground system, players build networks of subway 
connections, trying to help a passenger (everybody shares one big white 
passenger) move to one express and one regular station out of four 
random station cards.  The passenger moves under simple rules: walks 
fewest blocks, then (if tied) changes between different networks fewest 
times, then (if still tied) the active player chooses.  You're mainly 
using your current turn's builds to get the passenger to ride your lines 
to certain destinations rather than riding opponents' lines, perhaps to 
other destinations.
- Scrabble [Selchow & Righter], 2 players.
- Crokinole again, 2 teams of 2, the only game I repeated except Ta Yu.
- Zum Kuckuck [FX Schmid], 4 players, learned, won : simple but fun 
game, auctioning numbered Cluck cards where high bid gets the 
lower/better card and second-high bid gets the higher/worse card, lower 
bidders get nothing new, and whoever has the highest card (old or new) 
showing after each auction gets one of their cute yellow cockatoos SHOT 
DEAD!  Since the hands with many high/low bidding cards are more 
powerful, they get fewer cockatoos to start; and after each hand, you 
pass the bidding cards clockwise and play again, repeating until all 
players have played each set of cards.  That takes out the "luck of the 
draw".
- Ra [alea], 4 players, Knizia : One of the classic Eurogames, it uses a 
nice bidding mechanism (winning bid stays in the pot for the next 
winning bidder to use later) in auctions for goodies of various 
categories with various kinds of category scoring.
- Industrial Waste [Rio Grande Games], 3 players, won : managing a 
business to produce orders and earn money without having too much 
pollution build up.  I won by refusing to sell raw materials on a couple 
of occasions when the best player needed them, forcing him to discard a 
couple of orders.
- Tumblin' Dice [I forget the manufacturer], 4 players : flicking or 
rolling dice onto a terraced board, this is part shuffleboard, part 
Crokinole.  A "1" on the 1x level might get knocked and become a "5" on 
the 3x level (worth fifteen points instead of one), but might later get 
knocked off the end and prove to be worth zero when scored.  Fun.

In all those games, I won a bit less than my share, but came in second 
(of 3-5 players) more than my share.  I learned a bunch of games 
including at least two or three that I'll likely purchase.  Gheos is a 
nifty and competitive game with nice components at a low price.  Zum 
Kuckuck is a pretty neat game with the luck virtually removed but with 
every game different.  Underground is different enough from the other 
connection games, with a sort of puzzle element, to be interesting, and 
it's not too pricey.  I might also get Grand National Derby because of 
its combative element (just before the fence is scored, put a zero card 
on the horse somebody has bet twice on, and the horse gets SHOT DEAD!, 
well, no, it doesn't say that, just says the horse gets eliminated from 
the rest of the race).  I could imagine buying Money! for its auction 
mechanic.

And I had a lot of fun without getting busted or getting killed by a 
drunk driver or other less fun ways to ring out an old year and ring in 
a new year.
