OK, I really can't say much about the managerial situation in Oakland, since 
I don't follow the team (or even the sport) that closely.  But I do have an 
opinion on the above.  I don't think it would be at all "insane" for the team to 
keep the name "Oakland A's" if they move to Fremont.  I can think of a number 
of pro sports teams which have retained the name of the main nearby city even 
though they're based in a suburb.  I'd guess strongly that the team WOULD 
keep its current name under those circumstances, although I suppose San Jose and 
Bay Area would both be suitable alternatives.

The suggestion that they might use the name "California" makes me wanna puke, 
though.  First of all, I really dislike it when a team uses a whole state's 
name instead of just a city -- that seems unduly greedy to me.  (And given 
that, you can imagine just how much I detest the grossly misnamed "New England 
Patriots"!)  But the situation is exacerbated immeasurably when a team uses a 
state name and the state has another team (with a city name) within its borders.  
Thus, the Florida Marlins really piss me off!  It just sounds so stupid when 
we have games like "Florida at Tampa Bay."  Of course, while I'm railing, I 
should also inveigh against the Grand Award Winner for dumbest team name of all 
time, the "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim."  (And to think I actually almost 
liked this team once upon a time!)

OK, I'm better now!   :-)

There's been plenty of speculation.  City of Fremont made some official 
comments saying (1) they don't expect "Fremont" to be part of the name, 
and (2) they understand that it will be strictly "a marketing 
decision".  The second one is absolutely right.  They'll name it 
whatever they feel will sell the most.  Keeping the Oakland name isn't 
completely insane. Fremont is arguably an Oakland suburb and plenty of 
cities keep the city name when moving to a suburb.  Putting San Jose in 
the name has a lot of plus marketing but also some minus; unlike 
something more nebulous it reinforces the idea that the team has left 
Oakland and moved to another city (which is also both plus and minus).  
That's particularly true for the nationwide audience.  Some guy in 
Florida has no idea where Fremont is and only a hint of a clue where 
Oakland and San Jose are.  If the A's are still the Oakland A's, he 
thinks, "Oh, they got a new stadium somewhere"; if they become 
something generic like California A's, pretty much the same; but if 
they become the San Jose A's he thinks, "Hey, the A's left Oakland and 
moved to San Jose."  Also, putting San Jose in the name might cause 
Peter McGowan to kick up a fuss, though I don't think he could actually 
block the name change.  Some have suggested "South Bay A's" as a 
compromise, on the theory that it plays nearly as hard for the San Jose 
affection but with less blowback both from McGowan and from Oakland 
fans.

Oh, I think Washington definitely wanted the job in Oakland.  I'm just 
saying that between Oakland and Texas, Oakland was his second choice.  
He had to figure that Texas wasn't a definite yes (most in Texas are 
saying he was a longshot candidate, with Wakamatsu and Hillman being 
the favorites) and that Oakland wasn't a definite no. He definitely 
wanted to be a manager somewhere, and would happily take either job, 
but if he had the choice between the both of them he'd rather go to 
Texas. (There's a quote from one of the Texas people -- the owner, I 
think it was -- that suggests that, but only if you read between the 
lines.  Billy of course has revealed nothing about it.)

I figure Billy had not definitely decided against Wash, so he surely 
wasn't going to say anything about it before Texas hired him.  Now that 
he is hired, I still don't see there's a great need for Billy to let it 
be known (if indeed it is true) that he knew Texas was Wash's first 
choice.  What exactly is served by such a leak?  To diminish the public 
hostility?  That's going to flare up regardless and it's going to 
simmer down, and it's unlikely to do any real harm.  If it does, he can 
always leak it later.

The new conventional wisdom that is (barely) starting to form is that 
Beane's choice now is Trey Hillman, but San Diego might want him too in 
which case we probably won't get him.  A few weeks ago nearly everyone 
thought it was sure to be Geren, but now they don't seem so sure.  Not 
sure what the difference is. Maybe just idle minds starting to wander.  
Fan preference is all over the map.  In a straw poll I don't think any 
one candidate would get 25% support.  Hillman probably would rank 
highest, but there is substantial support for Geren, Black, Hershiser 
and numerous other candidates and non-candidates.  (Though come to 
think of it, I don't think I've seen anyone say we should choose Manny 
Acta.)

Not intended to support nor rebut your argument, but one data point you 
might not be aware of.  Fremont is in fact closer to downtown San Jose 
than to downtown Oakland, though not by much.  Although Fremont is 
arguably a suburb of Oakland, it's just as plausibly a suburb of San 
Jose.

I assume you know the logic for this, right?  The team wants to be 
called "Los Angeles" because their marketing has determined where the 
best money.  At the same time, the team is contractually obligated to 
have "Anaheim" in its name.  The contract doesn't specify that 
"Anaheim" has to be at the front end of the name.  Basically, they want 
to be called "Los Angeles Angels" and that other part is stuck on there 
because they're required to.

Fundamentally, my problem with an "Oakland A's" team in Fremont is  
just a personal one: I see Oakland as being a minor city, making it  
weird to keep their name when the team is in another minor city. It  
would be like having a stadium in Clearwater and calling the team the  
"St. Petersburg Rays" when Tampa is the only city of significance.

I'll agree with "in large part" but not "entirely".  I think some of it 
comes from history generally.  Oakland was larger than San Jose for 
most of its history.  Until recently, San Francisco - Oakland was 
comparable to Minneapolis - St Paul.

"Only city of significance".  Surely overstates the case.  Tampa isn't 
that much bigger than St Pete.  I'm not into Oakland pride nearly as 
much as others in the city, but if someone were to say San Francisco is 
the "only city of significance" in the Bay Area, I would surely object 
to that.

I think there's some truth in saying that the conceptual geography 
represented by the A's is Bay-Area-that's-not-San-Francisco.  Oakland 
was once the figurehead of that anti-region.  Now it's San Jose.  By 
that logic the team ought to become the San Jose A's.  That idea might 
be resisted by (1) Oaklanders who don't want to let go of the title of 
most prominent non-SF city in the Bay Area, and (2) San Francisco 
interests who prefer the team not attract greater not-SF following.
