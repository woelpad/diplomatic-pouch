Sorry, Jim.  Got to get my head on in the middle of this codiene  withdrawal.

Note to the GM.  You might consider requiring players to ask friends  to 
allow use of their email for the game.  Playing via telephone is costly  for old 
timers such as myself.

Ironically, on a circuit of genealogiest, there was one guy who was  
extremely bitter.  I scolded him but then was able to get him to talk to me  
privately.  After four days, he was ordering what I said to order for his  diabetes.  
Four weeks later, his symptoms subsided.  Five months  later, all of his 
diabetes symptoms went away and he started living a much  better life.  
 
I am, and have always been, a researcher.  I can tell hype from  truth.  And, 
I am willing to share.

Hi  Buddy, revised orders received.

I'm sorry for your difficulties with  pain, at least we're willing to 
prescribe things for it these days rather  than just say "live with the 
pain".  I understand about Terry, people  have different levels of patience 
and orientation toward their health and  their future.  Unfortunately (or 
perhaps fortunately) we cannot force  others to adopt ours.

Good luck keeping your health on  track,
Jim-Bob
