Hi Jim-Bob,

My TAP arrived today and I've given it and your ever-expanding entourage of 
subzines a good old read. As the 23 Tunes is held over - here's my 
submission again (a slight edit to remove a couple of giveaway UK 
spellings).

Richard

P.S. I still can't work out what the deadline is. The zine is dated 19th 
Feb. I had a quick scan of the leccy version on 3rd March and got my paper 
copy on 17th March....?

>>>23 Tunes<<<

Here's my guesses for this round:

1. Steve Emmert
2. Richard Smith
3. Brendan Whyte
4. Brad Wilson
5. Rick Desper
6. Jim-Bob Burgess
[Doug Kent, Dick Martin NTR]

..and the next instalment of choons...

Tortoise - Gamera

One of the top instrumental bands of recent years, Chicago-based Tortoise
defy an exact categorization - a bit post-rock, a bit jazz, and lots of
other styles too. The track I've chosen is a long piece from their Lazarus
Taxon boxed set. It opens with a gentle guitar melody but then really starts
to motor with a lively drum beat and a simple driving synth riff keeping you
happy for the next 10 minutes of your life.

Saracen - Mary

Famous for the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse song in the 80s, Saracen made
a comeback in 2003 with the album Red Sky, and now they've topped the lot
with a ridiculous Spinal Tapesque concept album about the Da Vinci Code,
called Vox in Excelso. This was started long before Dan Brown wrote his
book, so they can't be accused of cashing in. The songs are served up with
gusto in an old-fashioned hard-rock style, interspersed with cheesy
narratives. Once you've stopped laughing you realize how much you enjoyed
the album and give it another spin.
