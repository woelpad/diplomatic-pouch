Hi Jim-Bob,

Just got TAP #307 today and here's my entry for the 23 Choons game.=20

Guesses:
-------------

1. Brendan Whyte
2. Brad Wilson
3. Jim-Bob Burgess
4. Rick Desper
5. Richard Smith
6. Doug Kent
7. Steve Emmert
8. Dick Martin

New Choons:
-------------------

Download from http://www.filefactory.com/file/f377ed/  within 7 days for =
a free sample :-)

This time we're gonna have some live cuts!

4. Rammstein - Links 234 (Live)

German heavy metal band Rammstein are without doubt one of the best live =
acts in the world. This track is from the Volkerball DVD which features =
them in all their glory - pyrotechnics, costumes, blood, sado-masochism, =
and most of all arsch-kicking rock 'n' roll. They have been accused of =
many things including homoerotic symbolism and being Nazis. My chosen =
track is about their repudiation of the latter. The words contain "we =
sound right but we think left" whilst the music (deliberately) sounds a =
bit "zieg heil". Works for me, whenever I listen to it I have a strange =
urge to annex my next-door neighbors :-) =20

5. Porcupine Tree - Hatesong (Live)

British art-rock quartet Porcupine Tree have been getting increasing =
popular in America following two successful albums "In Absentia" and =
"Deadwing". This track is from the "Arriving Somewhere" DVD filmed in =
Chicago last year. Wow, awesome gig! The track I've chosen is "Hatesong" =
which is one of the highlights of the show with a total wig-out guitar =
solo and fantastic drumming. I can't get enough of these guys, they make =
other bands look like bumbling amateurs!

Richard

P.S. Oops, I forgot about having a connection. The connection between =
all my tracks is an nice easy "they are all 2006 releases either on CD =
album or DVD" N.B The Pure Reason Revolution single was 2005 but the =
album version from "The Dark Third" was 2006.=20

P.P.S Should I continue with the MP3 downloads?

Hmm, I thought all reasonably modern computers could play MP3s - Windows 
Media Player (PC) and Apple QuickTime (Mac) have been doin' it for years. I 
noticed you must have an old e-mail client as it didn't like the HTML mail 
(I'll try to remember to use plain text in future).

As you say, near the end of the game it might not be a bad idea to ask 
everyone to post their selections on the internet. It really is dead easy 
using one of the many free file hosting sites (YouSendIt, FileFactory etc.). 
It's free and just involves looking at a few advertisements, though I admit 
some of these may be a bit dodgy.
