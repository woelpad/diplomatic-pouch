sorry this is late... missed it when i brought the zine to work to type out 
the rest of me orders for Dave...


guesses
spangberg, , smith, desper, martin,wilson.

my 4 to get back in:

Je suis un rock star", Bill Wyman.
Wyman is not a rock star, more of a backup session musician for Mick Jagger, 
and he proves it on this album by still not relaising his inability to sing. 
But the album's title track is still a great Lolita standard... a pity the 
hovercraft is no more. Si si!

"Some girls", Racey.
Ah, clean cut goodlooking boys rocking away in a family way and ignoring 
those annoying punks down the road who had had too much media attention. 
What better way to get the family bopping in the late 70s?

"I've got a brand new combine harvester", the Wurzels.
When does a parody overtake its victim for sheer fun? When it's a Scrumpy 
and western track by the Wurzels. I can't wait to get my hands on her acres 
either! Corduroy pants all round.

"Grab this Thing", Sounds Incorporated.
A fantastic live act, and no less stunning on vinyl, but they never sold 
enough records... one fials to understand why when listening to them now, a 
sax-dominated drum-reinforced stomper of a track. Damn but that Ton Newman 
could play them skins!
