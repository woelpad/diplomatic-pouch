(Sean-Jeff): It's midgame for you while it's post game for me. That's right 
blame it on the country Stosh (as I stick my tongue at you). I thank you for 
your compliment, but I'd rather have been able to out survive you.

(Sean-Jeff): You know Jeff. I would love to be able to get you into the 
Nucleur Madd Yuppie game or however it's spelled. It is free, and I think 
that you'd have a blast. ;)
