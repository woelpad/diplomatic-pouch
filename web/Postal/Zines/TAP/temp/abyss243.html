<p><br><p><br>``You can't imagine something to be scared of;
Don't trust myself, don't trust what I see;
Can never make sense of what's happening to me.''
From ``Something to Be Scared Of'' off of the Mekons' latest <i>Journey
to the End of the Night</i>.
There's a NEW regular Diplomacy game start and this song is the game name!
See the returns to the hobby of Doug Kent and Jim (James Alan) Tretick
plus the rest of a great game lineup!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>We had a bit of snow this past week and that plus some busy stuff at work
was enough to let this slide a week.
But as a bonus, it means I can slip in some NCAA Tournament predictions
and commentary.
I am sliding most of a whole lot of music discussion that I am preparing
to next time.
We have Michael Lowrey's new subszine, <i>Houdini Blues</i> as well as the
return of David Partridge's <i>Tinamou</i> inside too!

<p>
<b>THE DUE DATE FOR ALL TINAMOU GAMES IS APRIL 16TH, 2001</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are preparing to ``take over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
As Michael Lowrey already has announced, <i>Carolina Command and Commentary</i>
is folded and replaced by <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a 
Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
See the first issue of <i>Houdini Blues</i> down below!
This will give me better coverage of the Dixie hobby and provide Michael a 
congenial place from which to publish.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here as 
Gary Coughlan has agreed to take Steve Langley's place as Italy.
Keep an eye on us old geezers here.....

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:

<p>

<p>
and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:

<p>
 http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.meurglys.com

<p>
The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (in a MUCH, MUCH improved way!)
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.

<p>
2) For the most recent issue of Pete Sullivan's subszine 
check out (this address will be changing shortly):

<p>

<p>
Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.
I'm not sure what Pete is up to at the moment, but we'll hear soon.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARK BERCH</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>A number of people have tried to contact Mark, but none have hit paydirt
yet.  I hope this one will be solved soon!!

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com or johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

Note that France has been eliminated and Jon Crocker's Austria is down
to a single unit.
David Partridge has not been playing his best game in recent seasons
and also is in severe trouble.
The witches are very strong and the rest may be racing for third place. 
Keep an eye on this space for further updates.
I've realized that the 1912 game ending deadline for this game
will unfortunately affect the outcome.
There is likely to be ``delaying tactics" popping up soon as players
play the system.
Still, I think a three way draw looks likely. 
The blow up over Lee Simpson's pointed comments toward
some one or some ones who have been passing E-Mail seems to have blown over
for the moment.
We all know how easy letter passing is in the E-Mail world and I'm
pleased to note that Lee and I share an utter distaste for it.
The very latest results seem to indicate that Lee's England has
stabbed David's Germany and Germany's long term prognosis is
looking increasingly precarious.
Go check out the web page for further discussion (I gotta leave you
guys hanging so that some of you might actually go look!).
The Boasters! game is starting up again too (see below).
Remember that the Boasters! game is not actually part of the Worldmasters
structure, it just is a game for fun amongst some of the prominent 
personalities in the Tournament.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALIAN PRESS):
The Italian government, has come to hear of a certain wager between the Czar
of all Russia and the ArchDuke of all Austro-Hungary.
Apparently the subject of the wager was about the inclination of the general
of the first army - general ``Wheretheheckami". Since his compass was lost while
setting up camp years ago and his maps seem to have become obsolete - he has
wandered from his base in Venice to the Alps, and back to Venice again - seemingly
meandering with no real purpose. 
There are rumours that the early engagement with the German Hun caused Wheretheheckami
to lose all his confidence and, in fact, become somewhat yellow bellied.

<p>
So the wager came about at a conference between the Czar and the Archduke.
The Czar wagered that he could co-erce Wheretheheckami to attempt the Alps for
the third time, while the Archduke scoffed at this, claiming that Wheretheheckami
is a coward and that he would retreat further into his homeland where he could
find solace in some of the fine Tuscan wine.
An admirable sum of money was wagered upon the outcome of the first Army's movements.

<p>
Both governments attempted to gain favour with the Italian government by making
offers of new territory and military aid - along with some economic aid if the
general could be persuaded to follow the path which they had chosen.

<p>
The exact sum of the wager is not known - but both parties have been quite active
and the Italian government reckon that the wager is very very substantial for
the offers of aid were substantial.

<p>
And so the bet is won and lost - and who has egg upon their face - I wonder.

<p>
Or were they all lying ?

<p>

<p>
Dear Jim,
I've just received a notice from Hanna Haas, Walter Luc Haas' wife in Switzerland,
that he passed away on Jan. 10, 2001.
He had been ill with cancer for over a year.
Walter was one of the first Postal Dip publishers in Central Europe.
His zine, BUMM, was published from the mid-70s to 1986, partly in German and
partly in English.
Hanna asked me to notify some of his American friends.
She only had addresses for me and for Sid Sackson.
You may wish to print this in your zine or send notices to other people who
may have known him personally or by mail.
We met him in Basel in about 1978.
If you wish to send a sympathy card, her address is: Hanna Haas, Brunngasse 83,
4153 Riehen, SWITZERLAND.

If you're receiving this email it's either because you're a relative, a
friend, someone who owes me money, or someone I've identified as having a
sense of humor (most of the Dip crowd falls into this part), and thus won't
mind too much if I shamelessly promote something near and dear to my heart.

<p>
Unlike Napster, where up until recently people buy the tune and then make a
copy of it that anyone can download without the Artist's permission, MP3
actually has a site that Artists who don't think they can make it
commercially put stuff on, so that people can download it WITH their
permission.  So I've had a request from such an artist, a group called:

<p>
``Bob and the Steves"

<p>
Apparently they put up a good deal of their music on the site, and, much to
their surprise, had a number of hits, to the point where one of their tunes
``I Got One", actually made it to #34 on the daily playlist of
electronic/experimental music (I think that was Sunday the 11th, as of
Wednesday the 14th it was #43).  As a favor to them, I hereby give you a
couple of links to their music, and request that you go there and take a
listen.  For my money (of which I get none), ``1984" is the best tune, with
``What's Wrong with That Girl" a close second, but I've been proven that I'm
not in tune with the listening public before, so I'm only requesting that
you go listen to ``I Got One", to see if any of my efforts can get it to the
Top 10.  It can be found at either:

<p>
http://genres.mp3.com/music/electronic/experimental/?tp

<p>
Or

<p>
http://www.mp3.com/BobandtheSteves

<p>
which might actually be easier.  Should you go to the band's part of the
website, I recommend that you read the info section to get a better handle
on what you're really listening to (and because it's hysterical).  Bonus
points if you figure out who the band members are.

<p>
I will NOT, however, request that you send this email to all your friends.
But I'd appreciate it if you did.
Thank you for your time and patience.

The Seattle to Olympia area had a 6.8 magnitude earthquake Wednesday,
about 11:00 am Pacific time.  The epicenter was between Tacoma and
Olympia, under the Nisqually river delta which empties into Puget Sound. 
Fortunately, the quake was 30 miles deep in the Juan de Fuca plate so
damage was much less severe than it otherwise would have been if it were
a shallow quake in the upper fault system.  The Puget Sound metro region
was lucky this time, and the quake is a wake up call to continue with
earthquake preparedness and retrofitting of buildings and freeway bridges
and overpasses.  Still, some people were injured from falling debris and
damage occurred to masonry buildings in Pioneer Square in Seattle,
structural damage to the Magnolia Street bridge, and the Capitol dome in
Olympia was cracked.  What is fortunate is the Alaska Way Viaduct, which
is an old double deck expressway running along the Seattle waterfront, is
still standing although closed for inspection.  We watched on the TV news
as the traffic on Alaska Way was merrily humming away only one hour after
the quake as if nothing had happened!  Totally bizarre.  The mice just
keep on running on that treadmill....

<p>
I was at the North Bend Ranger Station for training when the quake
occurred, the kids were in school in Granite Falls, and Cathy had gone to
Ryan's preschool class.  The kids went under their desks as they learned
in their drills.  In Granite Falls, Cathy said the quake felt like an
intense vibration with the windows rattling, as if a truck or
construction work was going on outside without stopping (new school
construction is going on right there).  It knocked merchandise off the
shelves at the Red Apple super market.  At home, Cathy discovered all the
kitchen cabinet doors had been knocked open, but nothing fell out.  I
need to get those door latches!

<p>
In North Bend, the ground rolled as if you were standing in a boat on a
lake being rocked by waves.  The class participants and I left the
conference room, and once outside, we just stood in place swaying back
and forth.  It's a weird feeling.  Then we heard a roar and saw a large
landslide coming down the southwest slope of Mt. Si, kicking up a cloud
of dust.  Mt. Si is a huge landmark outside of North Bend, made familiar
to TV viewers of the series Twin Peaks.  A section of road I would have
driven home between Snoqualmie Falls and Fall City was temporarily
blocked by a mudslide, so I had to detour around that via the freeway
system, which seemed to be undamaged.  Had this been a shallower quake,
some freeway overpasses likely would have collapsed and I probably would
have been stuck in North Bend, at least for the night.  I'm back to North
Bend Thursday for the second half on the training.  Oh joy.

<p>
We were really fortunate this time.  And this wasn't even the `big one'
which the Pacific Northwest is overdue for and can happen at any time: a
giant subduction zone quake in the Juan de Fuca and North American
plates, predicted to last 4 minutes, be an 8 to 9 in magnitude, and have
8 feet of vertical movement...........

Jim;
Happy last few days of Epiphany.  I was in NOLA and came home with a slew
of beads, cups, doubloons, etc.  Mardi Gras itself is not until 2/27, but
this first weekend of parades is just right for codgers.
<i>((We had a big Mardi Gras party at our house, masks, beads, King Cake,
the whole deal..... unfortunately, we didn't eat the whole King Cake
on the night of the party so I finally got the baby for breakfast three
days later.))</i>
    
<p>
Congratulations on <i>TAP</i> 242.  That is one huge number of issues.  And you
just keep going.

Recent political squawking about Clinton's pardons - what, any of us
should be surprised that there is controversy beyond the end - have paired
Rich and Jonathan Pollard.  About halfway through my brief publishing career
I started to name all games after double agents.  Pollard was one of the
last I identified before I folded.  He would have been way harder for the
world community and especially Israel to accept than mere money for
salvation, eh, pardon, like Rich.
<i>((No, and the Constitution makes it clear that these are the rules.
I didn't squawk too much when GHW Bush pardoned Cap Weinberger (and thus
himself indirectly) and I don't squawk too much now.
I don't want to change the Constitution on this point, so you have to take
the good with the bad.
It's a lesson to be careful about whom we elect as Presidents - Jimmy Carter
is the only one I know of who didn't make questionable last second pardons -
well, then again, maybe not ;-)
Money, yes, but remember that Clinton was hot and heavy trying to complete a
``crowning achievement peace deal'' between Israel and the Palestinians in 
those last days.
I honestly think that Clinton's move had more to do with trying to bribe Barak
than that he himself was being bribed.
Think about it..... that ``phone call'' between Barak and Clinton probably was
only tangentially about Rich.
Why doesn't the press report THAT!?))</i>

<p>
Now, talking about money buying salvation; spring training has started
and your Bosox have one of the primo hitters joining Nomar.  One pitcher and
pray for three days of rain but two big time hitters.  And will O'Leary
stick or Nixon be ``an everyday player" contraire to the manager and GM.
<i>((spring training for the Red Sox so far has been a ``don't talk to
me about it'' - I really hope it is a microcosm of everything that NEVER
happens during the season.  Things will brighten up tomorrow (as I write),
Pedro takes the mound for his first Spring Training start.
I predict three or four innings, no runs, two strikeouts per inning, and dominance.
That is so easy a pick as to be guaranteed.))</i>    

<p>
There was some discussion last issue about Puckett and the Twins, that
there would never be another Twin of greater than three years who made it
unto the Hall ballot.  Despite the pending work stoppage, I tend to believe
that MajorLeagueBaseball.com really is going to adjust the major inequities
between the franchises and in the middle part of this decade we will see the
Twins and other teams be competitive and stay competititve.  All because of
Bud Selig convincing the owners to share - either equally or with greater
return to the small market teams depending upon how you want to label it -
all the money they will make from the internet and live streaming every game
every day.  It is now expected to gross one billion dollars per year in 2005.
<i>((Yes, that is the magic revenue source that can reverse the unbalanced
revenue from TV rights.
I agree with you and have tried to reason with Goz, but you can't
reason with him ;-) he's on a tear.
He's on deck and next up to bat.))</i>

<p>
Which makes next year the right time to get together a group and some
financing to buy a franchise and hold on for the whopping increase in it's
value.  Do you have any friends with more than loose change in their
pockets?  I don't.
<i>((And the Red Sox are for sale..... damn!))</i>

<p>
Have a happy St. Paddy's Day.  I can't wait for my annual ``Kiss me, I'm
Irish" blarney.

Jim-Bob,
I must say that I admire you.  I was in the Boston area over the past
weekend visiting friends, and it's always refreshing to see the Sports
coverage of The Globe, especially around Spring Training.  All is well,
everyone is 0-0, and all of New England STILL thinks that the Red Sox can
beat the Yankees.  And they might beat the Yankees of March, or even May.
But they won't beat the Yankees of August, when Steinbrenner buys up all the
free agents and lets Torre decide which ones to play.

<p>
But it's nice to see you still believe.  Reminds me of my days as a die-hard
Cubs' fan (which haven't yet ended).
<i>((I do, and my wife still laughs hysterically at me.
At least she likes baseball.
She keeps telling me that my overactive interest in the NCAA basketball tournament
is the only thing that keeps me from being perfect.

Think we can get Series tickets at Wrigley or Fenway?  Wood vs Pedro in Game 1?

I have got to start some sort of rating system.  How else can I tell you that
a movie is pretty good with lots of parts that could be better without
writing a sentence like this one?
 
<p>
We have a caper.  I like capers.  This caper isn't exactly the focus of the
movie the way most capers are.  It's just the kickoff for a convoluted plot
that takes an unlikely bunch of casino robbers from Las Vegas to just north
of Seattle.  They have all of the cops in the west, led by a couple of U.S
Marshals who have some of the worst ``man to man" dialogue that I have ever
winced away from chasing them.  They leave a trail of dead bodies (well, one
of them does) along the way, but there is never any sign that they are going
to be caught.
 
<p>
There are lots of coincidences.  In fact, Murphy, (Kevin Costner) even
notices.  Still, despite some really stupid stuff, like Ice-T swinging
hanging from a chain hoist by his feet with two machine guns blazing, it was
a fun movie.  The story was well plotted.  The direction sucked.  Costner
played a really bad man very well.  Kurt Russell play a not quite so bad man
almost as well.  Courtney Cox was great as a not quite so bad woman.  Her
kid, played by David Kaye, was a six year old pickpocket and thief.  He was
pretty good as a bad person, too.  There were no good guys.  Unless you count
the cops, who were there to lose in gun battles.
 
<p>
Jon Lovits played the part of a fence who realized that he was in the wrong
line of business after it was too late to start a new career.  Howie Long
even had a small role as the getaway pilot and all around helper.  Like
``Hamlet" most of the cast ended up dead.
 
<p>
It was a lot of fun.  Too bad it wasn't better.

<i>The Mexican</i> in question is a cursed gun.  It is old and quite beautiful, and
apparently worth a whole lot of money.  Gary, pronounced Jerry, (Brad Pitt)
is working off some indentured time for a big time crook who is in prison
because Gary ran a red light.  Fair being fair and all, Gary is indentured to
work for the big time crook until said crook gets back out of prison.  There
are various schools of thought as to what will happen to Gary when said event
occurs.
 
<p>
The event is on the horizon, and for one last job Gary is being sent to
Mexico to bring back the gun and the kid who has found the gun.  The kid
turns out to be grandson of the big time crook.  Gary only learns this after
the kid is killed in a freak bullet related accident.
 
<p>
At the same time Sam (Julia Roberts) wants Gary to quit working for the big
time crook and come with her to Las Vegas where she will get a job as a
croupier and they will live happily ever after.
 
<p>
Gary and Sam are supposed to be deeply and truly in love, although they act
like a couple which has been married for far too long.
Leroy is set to keep tabs on Sam to give Gary motivation.  In the meantime, a
second Leroy is sent to keep tabs on Sam and kill the first Leroy.  The scond
Leroy (James Gandolfini) has the most interesting character in the movie.
The relationship that forms between him and Roberts nearly makes up for the
lack of same between Pitt and Roberts.
 
<p>
The story is quite convoluted, and for all the bad things that happen to the
various people who try to take ownership of the gun you'd have to go along
with the curse idea.  Pretty well directed.  Too bad Pitt and Roberts never
really clicked.

Interesting story.  Well directed, wondefully acted.  I have to say I enjoyed
every bit of it.
 
<p>
Now that's a short review.
Maybe a little bit more just to let you know what it is about.
 
<p>
Emil and Oleg come to America to collect a debt.  A very dear friend of
theirs made off with the loot from a bank robbery while they did time.
Oleg is a big Frank Capra fan.  He just loves the idea of making movies.  So
when he sees a really super video camera in a storefront he just has to have
it.  While Oleg goes to get his new camera Emil calls a cab so they will have
a getaway car.  The two are a team.
 
<p>
Their friend is in hiding, but he sent his sister in Prague a letter saying
that he was doing well, and put his return address on it.  This indicates the
level of intelligence of all three of these guys.
Robert Dinero plays Eddie Flemming, the top media darling on the NYPD.
Edward Burns plays Jordy Warshaw, a fire marshall and arson investigator.
They come together because Emil kills people and likes to set fire to them.
This is what happened to his dear old friend after telling Emil that the
money was already spent.
 
<p>
While Eddie and Jordy work out working together, Emil and Oleg watch
television and come to the conclusion that the way to make it in America is
to film yourself killing someone famous, get yourself declared insane, then
sell the rights to your movie.
 
<p>
Twisted idea.  Brilliantly told.

<b>THE NCAA COLLEGE BASKETBALL SEEDINGS - MY COMMENTS AND PREDICTIONS</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>For once, because of the delay, the release of an issue of <i>TAP</i> coincides
precisely with the start of the NCAA College Basketball tournament.
I know the non-Americans just don't understand our fascination with this tournament,
but basically it is the quintessential American experience.  
It is an event where Duke and Stanford, as well as Holy Cross and Princeton,
get to compete together.
Plus, the ``one and done'' format helps to allow upsets to anyone who can't win
six straight games.
64 teams don't do it, and only one does.

<p>
Let's comment region by region and then have some admittedly fanciful comments
on where I might see the Final Four..... focusing as usual on potential upsets,
you know how I hate to miss an upset!

<p>
<p><i>The East:</i> Arguably the top four seeds are the hardest in the country, plus
teams like Ohio State, Iowa, and Georgia that I see as legitimate shots to make
the Sweet Sixteen.  Here are the key games/upset possibilities as I see it:
Georgia really could upset Duke, Iowa and Creighton should be a great first rounder,
and Holy Cross will at least put a scare in Kentucky.  Georgia even making it into
the tournament signals that the NCAA is REALLY serious about non-conference schedule.
Georgia had a killer schedule and finished just above .500, but they got in over
Big East teams like Connecticut (who played patsies) and Villanova.
They even seeded Georgia higher than Providence and Georgetown, two other teams
that did not play difficult non-conference
(Georgia should beat Missouri easily by the way, especially 
if Kareem Rush doesn't play, watch that injury line).
But Duke, Kentucky, Boston College, and UCLA are all going to be tough to keep out
of the Sweet Sixteen.  I see there being very few early upsets, lots of great
games and a set of killer matchups for Philadelphia next week.
Finally, I say that Ohio State upsetting UCLA is the only one that actually happens
(Ohio State had six road games in their final eight games and went 7-1 to finish
strong enough to get in here - they faltered in the Big Ten Tournament, but that
will only be the ``catching of the breath")
and so you have 1,2,3,5 advancing.

<p>
Duke and Ohio State will not be close, but Boston College will beat Kentucky 
(Tubby's boys have been playing really well, but they can't shoot from outside
and BC can defend like maniacs inside, this guy Agbai or something is a monster) but
Boston College still can't beat Duke, so Duke makes another trip to the Final Four.
Boston College got killed by Duke for one of its losses at 97-75 on January 16th.
Well, it will be closer, but Boston College just doesn't have the athletes.
You may say, what upsets?  
Well, keep reading, this is the only region I think plays out this way.

<p>
<p><i>The West:</i> Some weak and beatable high seeds here.  I think someone will upset
Stanford, someone who is athletic and quick.
Iowa State did not finish all that well and definitely will have trouble with
whichever of Arkansas and Georgetown come out of that first round game.
Georgetown was seeded down for the weak non-conference schedule, but they
are a very, very tough 10.
Maryland and Wisconsin will be a killer matchup and Indiana COULD get beaten
by Kent State (Trevor Huffman is one of those point guards that can make upsets).
Now for the hunches, the winner of Georgia Tech.(who has guards who shoot the 3)
and St. Joe's will beat Stanford and the first big, big upset of the tournament...... 
and I'd put my money on St. Joe's(watch out for Jameer Nelson, who could be 
an All American before he is done, and scorer Marvin O'Connor).
I think Indiana survives the scare by Kent State and goes to the Sweet Sixteen
since I don't really respect Cincinnati, but that choice may come back to haunt me.
I'll pick Arkansas to defeat Georgetown in a war 
(turnovers, turnovers, turnovers, the Razorbacks force 23 a game!) and then 
Iowa State, there are a lot of battle tested athletes on that Arkansas team.
Not to pick TOO many upsets, Maryland will beat Wisconsin and make it to Disneyland
town (battle between the Terps' Juan Dixon and the Badgers' Mike Kelly - remember
the NCAA Tournament is always about the guards!).
So, for this region, that's a 3,4,7,9 in the Sweet Sixteen and there could be even
more upsets than this.

<p>
Indiana (that lack of a point guard HAS to stop them sometime!!)
and Maryland stop their marches here.  St. Joseph's and Arkansas (respectively)
see to that.
I'm picking Arkansas to make the surprise run to the Final Four.

<p>
<p><i>The South:</i> Wow.
All the surprise teams that I like (well, almost all of them) are here in this
bracket, especially the local PC Friars.
Once they decided to weight the non-conference schedules as much as they did,
PC had no chance of getting the seven seed that I kind of thought they deserved.
But, if you aren't going to get a seven, getting a ten is in some sense just as
good (depth, shooting and defense - the Friars only problem is not having
a go-to scorers who can drive and create when those inevitable shooting 
dry spells hit).
Penn. St. will be very hard to beat, but if they do, they face a fading North
Carolina team with an overrated Joseph Forte outside and Brendan Haywood inside.
Penn State will run a zone against the Friars and I predict it will fail.
John Linehan will harass North Carolina and can beat them as a surprise.
As always, I'd like to like Princeton, but realistically they just will 
soften up the Tar Heels.
I'll pick PC for the Sweet Sixteen just because I have made a career in forecasting
this tournament of underestimating North Carolina.
Why stop now??
What about Texas (gritty defense, defense, defense), Temple (Greer and Wadley
play defense, defense, defense), and Florida (hey, I just like them) 
in the next bracket up?  Wowsy, dowsy!
And even Western Kentucky (7 foot center Marcus and three point shooter
McPherson) will give Florida a tussle, but not enough to win.
I choose Temple to come out of here in a close battle.
Moving up one more quarter bracket, you have FOUR teams that have close to equal 
chances of getting to the Sweet Sixteen from these eyes: Virginia, Gonzaga,
Oklahoma, and Indiana State.
Virginia can beat anyone big and lose to anyone big, so this is the type of team
that does NOT make it to the Sweet Sixteen.
Gonzaga still has a neat little team (still has Casey Calvary inside though), 
so it could be the one who does it, but 
betting on a Cinderella two years in a row is so risky.
Oklahoma is good (hey, but their point J.R. Raymond is suspended!), 
and Indiana State has some good players (point Michael Menser has a deadly three
point shooting eye and Kante is a shot blocking center) so let's go with 
Indiana State to be the big surprise team - a 13 to the Sweet Sixteen.
Finally, California (I've heard about Sean Lampley and hope to get to
see him this weekend!) and Fresno State!
Double WOW!!
Still, after they beat each other up (Fri. late), I'll predict Michigan State 
will get to the 
Sweet Sixteen over the winner (let's say Fresno State) so we have just one 
favorite making the Sweet Sixteen.
So, that's a 1,10,11,13 run.

<p>
Temple and PC would be a really interesting game, but why not ride the local horse
one more round to the Elite Eight?
Michigan State kills Indiana State's Cinderella hopes pretty easily as they are dashed
in Atlanta in a weird rematch of the Magic Johnson/Larry Bird teams in, what
was it? 1978??
Can't resist the sweetness of it all.
PC can't beat Michigan State though, so we get a second one into the Final Four.

<p>
<p><i>The Midwest:</i> Butler is a hot Cinderella pick in this bracket, but they
go up against a Wake Forest team in Round 1 that is seeded a bit lower than
I would have expected (the Demon Deacons beat EVERYONE outside of the ACC
and couldn't beat the Duke, UNC, Maryland, Virginia crowd - is this that
big a fault???). 
And Arizona..... well, I thought they might be a Final Four team as I thought
about it before seeing the matchups.
So, can I pick against Arizona now?
No, but if Butler beats Wake Forest then WATCH OUT Arizona!!
Wake Forest gets the prize for the biggest sucky draw.
Xavier might have been the last at-large team into the Tournament, but that
does not bode well for a first round win.
Jeff Ruland's Iona CAN beat Ole Miss, but will they?
I'm going to pick Notre Dame because I think the Big East as a whole was 
underseeded (but for good reason, not enough good non-conference schedules)
and I think some teams will go on a run.
Next we have Syracuse's bracket and a key here is Preston Shumpert's 
physical health.  
If he plays, and plays well, they can get to the Sweet Sixteen, if not
Hawaii or Cal.State Northridge (they won AT UCLA this year!) will be a Cinderella.
I'll bet on Hawaii (center Troy Ostler is back in form after an injury), 
since I don't think Shumpert will be 100%.
Charlotte/Tennessee will be another great 8-9 game and either of them could
beat Illinois (yes, Frank Williams is a great guard, but..... no, I just have
to go with the hunch).
Hmmm, on that hunch let's go with Tennessee (possibly THE most athletic team
in the tournament, and somehow avoided the Seton Hall psychological split -
if I'm wrong it is because they lose in Round 1 though)
into the Sweet Sixteen.
That makes it seeds of 2,6,8,12.

<p>
Arizona and Notre Dame is not a good matchup for the Fighting Irish,
plus St. Patrick's Day will have been LAST week, so bye, bye Irish.
Hawaii and Tennessee won't be close.
The Southeastern Conference really is a killer, so Tennessee is really,
really battle tested.
Hmmm, my hunch says Tennessee will be one of the major surprises of the 
tournament, so let's knock Arizona out here.
This also will drive all the basketball purists crazy since there are a whole
host of ``I''s in the Team from Tennessee.
Somehow Tony Harris keeps them all together when he is on the court.

<p>
<p><i>Sweet Sixteen Seeds Overall:</i> I've predicted a pretty good balance overall.
Two ones, two twos, two threes, a four, a five, a six, a seven, an eight, a nine,
a ten, an eleven, a twelve, and a thirteen!
Perfect and that was without even trying!!

<p>
<p><i>The Final Four:</i> Duke easily will beat whomever comes out of the West, I'm
picking Arkansas, but it could be any of a number of mid-level seeds, to get to
the Championship Game.
Tennessee and Michigan State?
Yes, Tennessee would win this, but can't beat Duke.
Picking Duke is the easy way out, but picking Arkansas or Tennessee seems foolhardy
in the extreme.
Can't be faulted for picking Duke.....
looks like it should be a great tournament!!!
Hope you all enjoyed my forecasts.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>The Women's Tournament:</i> Yes, I think UConn still can win with both
Svet Abrosimova and Shea Ralph on the sidelines.
Watch Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi rise to the challenge.
And remember that Tennessee has lost Tamika Catchings too.
Georgia is the only team that can give UConn a challenge in the East Regional
and Tennessee should be able to get past second best in the region Purdue
in the Mideast.
And yes, Notre Dame will get out of the Midwest.
But, the West Region is a crapshoot.
I think it is interesting that Rutgers is in the West Region and gets to play
their first round games at home in Piscataway!
In fact, NONE of the top seeds in the West actually are there, so the other games are
in Gainesville, Durham, and Norman.
I've always liked Stanford, but they just can't seem to play as a team and 
Washington isn't that good either - nothing happening out West in Women's
College Basketball.
Anyway, I'll root for Rutgers all the way to join the Big Three in the Final Four.
Women's College Basketball is becoming centered on the same power conferences
and power teams as the Men's Tournament.
Looking at the whole field there are only a handful of teams that would look out
of place in a men's draw (like S.F. Austin).
I don't know how the Final Four matches up, but my money is still on UConn, with
Sue Bird winning MVP of the finals.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 13 Mar 2001 11:07:45 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
East:
you are much more gung ho about Georgia than I am.  I see a team which was
beaten badly by <i>Wake Forest</i> and has 14 losses.  I don't see why ``strength
of schedule" should count for so much if they lose all these tough games.
Duke will clobber them, if Georgia somehow manages to get past Missouri (and
I pick Missouri in that game.)  (Kareem Rush is supposed to play - I would
agree with your pick if he was out.)

<p>
You criticize UConn for ``playing patsies".  This isn't completely fair - they
did BEAT Arizona, after all, and also played in some Hawaii classic and also
played Texas.  Part of the problem is that they lost to Dayton in the first
round of that Hawaii thing, which sent them into the losers' bracket.  But   
a bigger problem is that they had both UMass and URI on their schedule, and
those two programs, which were both strong just a few years ago, have both
fallen apart.  I think UConn, with wins over Arizona, BC, and Notre Dame,
had a more impressive resume than Georgia, who only beat Tennessee(overrated),
Villanova, and Ga. Tech.
<i>((Ah, but I rate Tennessee higher than you do..... ;-)  We shall see, the
proof is in the pudding.))</i>

<p>
But Duke, Kentucky, Boston College, and UCLA will be tough to keep out of the
Sweet Sixteen.
<i>((Yeah, I really like Sean Connally (former PC) on Ohio State, but that
pick could be wrong too and the favorites easily could sweep here.))</i>

<p>
I picked Iowa over Kentucky, but only because I think it's necessary to pick
at least one upset.  I think Iowa can do it.  I also pick Duke over BC in the
regional final.  BC <i>could</i> be a Final Four team, if it were not in the same
regional as the best team in the country.  Coach K is excellent at preventing
Duke from overlooking anybody or choking.

<p>
West:
First, let me say that it's outrageous that Georgetown should get a 10 seed.
This was clearly done to set up an Arkansas-Georgetown game.  The NCAA has
done this in the past.  They also set up UMD/George Mason in the same
sub-regional, as well as sending Lefty Driesell's Georgia State to face
Wisconsin.  They would have sent the entire DC area to Idaho, but they are
prevented from sending UVA and UMD to the same sub-regional.  Hmm...I didn't 
pick <i>any</i> upsets in this subregional, except Georgetown over Arkansas (which
isn't really an upset.)

<p>
On the other side, I'll jump on the ``Cincinnati is overrated and Huggins is a
terrible tourney coach" bandwagon and pick BYU over Cincinnati in the first
round.  The rest plays according to form, and then Maryland wins the whole
region, beating Iowa State and Stanford.

<p>
You picked St. Joe's over Stanford?  Let's just say I disagree.
<i>((Heh, heh, heh, I'm out on the limb, but I've gotta hunch about this one!))</i>

<p>
South:
Here I go nuts and pick Princeton over UNC.  We all know that this will be a
close game, and I see John Thompson gaining a measure of revenge for 1982
as his son, also John, runs the Tar Heels out of town!  I wish I could pick
both PC and PSU to win the first round, as I think either could wreak havoc
in this regional.  I pick Penn State, and have them going to the regional final.
And to liven things up, I have John Chaney's Temple Owls doing their typical
tourney performance: big upsets when they have a low seed (the flip side is
they always tank when they are seeded high.) I pick them to beat Texas and
Florida.  In the next quarter bracket, I have Gonzaga beating UVA (this is
probably everybody's upset pick, I might change back) and then beating OU to
reach the Sweet Sixteen.  With the Zags back for a third time, I think the label
``Cinderella" doesn't fit anymore.

<p>
But I pick Michigan State to roll through the bracket.  This is an extremely
strong, efficient, and well-coached team.  They beat Penn State in an all-Big
Ten regional final.

<p>
Midwest: a big soft region, with the weakest #1 seed and a bunch of other
overrated teams (Kansas, Tennessee).  Wake might be the second-best team in the
region, but they have to play the best team (Arizona) in the second round, and
they will lose.  Up a quarter bracket, I pick Notre Dame to beat Xavier and Ole
Miss.  Notre Dame could present matchup problems for a lot of teams, but
again, they then meet Arizona in the ``teams which lost to UConn in the
supposedly patsie schedule" Sweet Sixteen matchup.  The next quarter-bracket
isn't impressive at all.  Question: when Syracuse meets Kansas in round 2, which
tourney curse will trump the other one?  Both teams are notorious tourney
chokers.  Well, Syracuse at least made the Championship game twice, so I'll take
them to the Sweet sixteen.  And in the last quarter-bracket I'm trying to figure
which of Charlotte or Tennessee will beat the totally overrated Illini in round
2.  Tennessee is very cold and Charlotte is very hot, so I'll go with Charlotte.
Then the regionals play out with Arizona beating Notre Dame and Syracuse.

<p>
Sweet Sixteen:                                                                                         

<p>
I've got

<p>
East: 1,2,3,4

<p>
West: 1,2,3,4

<p>
South: 1,7,11,12

<p>
Midwest: 2,5,6,9

<p>
3 1s, 3 2s, 2 3s, 2 4s, and a bunch of spoilers, including an obligatory 12
seed.
<i>((See, you are just about precisely a whole level of upsets down from
where I am - which is where I like to be....))</i>

<p>
Final Four: you pick Arkansas to win four games?  I pick them to win zero.
Anyway, Duke easily makes it to the final.  On the other side Arizona beats
MSU.  In the final?  You've got the two best teams in the country and either
would be a good pick.  I think I split my vote here, picking Arizona at
Yahoo and Duke at ESPN.  If forced to stop sitting on the fence, I will pick
Duke, based on the relative strength of the coaches.  Coach K is the best
basketball coach in the NCAA, and Duke wins #3 for him this year.

<p>
Womens tourney: the committee really screwed over UConn, by
a) saying that they are the 3rd best #1 seed (why?  they split their games with
both Notre Dame and Tennessee, who didn't play each other.  The committee said
it wasn't because of Shea Ralph.  Apparently they then mumbled something about
Notre Dame being the regular season champ.  Right!  They didn't play a
home-and-home, they played in South Bend?  Is winning on the home court that  
impressive?)  Then, after doing that, they put Georgia and NC State on the
path to the Final Four.  Thanks!

<p>
Doesn't matter, UConn will beat them all (at least until the Final Four).
I also pick Rutgers and the big Three in the Final Four.  (Rutgers actually has
an easier draw than UConn.  Good job with the seeding, guys!)  I get sentimental
and pick UConn to win again, even though I think it's really Notre Dame's year.
If Ruth Riley doesn't get hurt (a big if, given  what's happened to the Svet,
Shea, and Tamika Catchings) then Notre Dame simply has the best team.  But
I still pick UConn.  I figure Kelly Schumacher will keep Riley under wraps.
The final against Tennessee will be an easier game.

GERMANY to AUS-HUN:  Look, if you attack me and give Randy a free ride to a
win, maybe I'll bury you in a ton of ants while Don Williams reads his press
out loud.

<p>
Tzar to Kaiser: Nice offer. I understand that the Archduke also received a
nice offer. Hopefully the Archduke's response to your offer was much like my
response to your offer.  i.e.  Get Dead.

<p>
Stuttgart:  The Kaiser and the Imperial High Council are honored to welcome
the internationally renowned adventurer Paul Roberge to the post of Pretendre
Royale du Gaulle.  The new leader has been extended an invitation to enjoy a
yard of our finest Doppelbock (in a village far from our factories, banks,
and intelligence posts) and a toast of the Junkers' finest schnapps to
commemorate his ascension and the coming Golden Age.

<p>
Dachau:  No reporter noticed as a still-drunk Frenchman tumbled off a small
pier and face-down into the muck.  Nobody heard the bubbles and gasps of his 
final attempts to breathe.  And no one would believe that such a fate could
befall a King, denying his last panicky wish for exile and survival.  An
Afghani laborer carrying a barrel of pork rinds hocked and spat, not noticing
the splatter of his expectoration upon a bloated buttock arcing up from the
mire and offal.

<p>
Russia to France: Welcome to the game, Paul. This one should prove
interesting...

<p>
Sev to Bud: Rumania is yours, as promised. Now we have to concentrate on a
center in a more central location. Meet me for a vodka martini in Berlin
perhaps?

<p>
Randy to Kent 's rogue fleet: You have been officially assimilated now.
Where, pray tell, will your fleet gain its sustenance for next year?

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The primary Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings'' rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Jack McHugh claims the Federation,
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
The other races in the game are the Klingons, Cardassians, Species 8472,
and the Vulcans.
We ONLY need two more, let's get this one going.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED and Breaking Away games.
I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.
Breaking Away has Jim Tretick, Rick Desper, and Eric Brosius signed up thus far.
We need six players.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of meurglys.com

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Doesn't look like there are any retreats, but there still is a Summer press
season.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DATELINE BERLIN): The kaiser wishes to report that a special messenger has been 
dispatched to bring succor and cheer to the Games Master during these trying 
times of a beer famine in Rhode Island. 

<p>
(CON to WESTERN POWERS): Please desist with the
overwhelming amount of correspondence.    

<p>
(BUDAPEST):  A Western full-scale panic attack ALREADY?  Looks like 
Buddy's been stirring up the pot....

<p>
(ANKARA): Sultan Abdul Ahmid Ellis III, in a speech
before 100,000 or more of the Faithful, swore that the
Infidels and Imperialists in Northern and Western
Europe would feel Allah's wrath. ``In particular", the
Sultan avered, ``we feel that the government of Great
Britain has been most inappropriate in their threats
and accusations". An English Union Jack was hoisted up
a a flagpole and then lit for all to see as the
Islamic faithful raised a tremendous cry of ``Down with
the Imperialists! Down with the Infidel Dogs!"

<p>
1) I thought I had orders from Chris, but they turned out to be orders for
a previous season.  
NMR insurance failed, so I have to call Phil as a standby.
A reminder, according to my house rules, if Chris wants to keep the position,
he needs to have draft Spring orders to me by the WINTER deadline.
Otherwise, Phil will take over at that point.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am taking reservations for the Edward Teller game, which will
be the next NYEED 7x7 game in this series.
Since it was asked, I'll remind everyone that we will again be
playing the Black Hole Variant.
Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.
Karl Muller, Harry Andruschak, and Sandy Kenny are on board.

<p>
2) I'll keep the game in here until the Endgame statements or press die out,
but probably this is it.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): I was on vacation in Egypt from 17 February to 2 March.  I 
picked up two weeks of mail on the 3rd, and found TAP #242 on the 4th.  I am 
not sure if this will make the deadline for TAP #243. If not, it can go into 
TAP #244, along with my NYEED Endgame Statement.

<p>
The vacation was quite wonderful at times, marred by the constant hassle of 
dealing with those Egyptians selling junk to tourists at every pyramid, 
temple, mosque, or church. I need to reassure <i>TAP</i> readers about the safety of 
the trip. Yes, there have been attacks on tourists, the worst being the 
massacre of 58 at The Temple of Hatshepsut near Luxor in November of 1997. In 
response, there has been a massive increase in security. Alas, this means the 
Nile is closed to cruise ships from Cairo to Luxor.  In its place our group 
sailed 7 nights from Luxor to Aswan and back.  We always had two soldiers on 
board with assault rifles ready. Our buses had armed escorts following us at 
all times. Metal detectors were in use everywhere, and I had to stop wearing 
my MedicAlert bracelet and underwire bra. And none of this prevented me from 
contracting dysentery towards the end of the trip.

<p>
And none of this detracted from the sights and sites themselves. You can read 
all you want to about the pyramids, look at all the pictures, see them on TV 
and IMAX screen, and none of this will prepare you for standing at the foot 
of them and looking up at the vast piles of precisely laid stones. It is one 
thing to read and enjoy Shelley's poem ``Ozymandias" and quite another to 
visit, in person, the Ramesseum of Ramses II that inspired the poem. Ramses 
II had better luck with his temple at Abu Simbel, which we also visited. We 
also visited Coptic Churches, Mosques, and Greek and Roman ruins. All in all, 
we packed a lot into those two weeks. Of course, we also missed a lot.  Even 
two months would not be enough to see all there is to see, and I do hope to 
return to Egypt after I retire in 14 years at age 70. Hopefully, by that time 
the Nile will again be open to cruise ships that can sail all the way from 
Cairo to Aswan. Perhaps I can also visit the western oasis towns.

<p>
Any questions about my trip? Just ask.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-DR. WEISS): O yes, the obvious dangers and causes such as breast 
cancer have been eliminated, leaving my 5 prescription drugs as the most 
likely culprits.  But it could also have been the TAGAMET I was taking, which 
causes gynecomastia in over 3% of its users. So I have stopped taking it and 
will wait and see if the condition stops growing.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Lots of blood coming up in the fall for this one, methinks!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE):  Sorry, I can't help you with
interpreting the Austrian press releases.  Never was any good at
deciphering German-language diatribes.

<p>
(GENERAL MUNCHOUSEN to THE WORLD):
Now we will see if I can save the 2nd.Army group and bring Glory to
regiment.
The Battle begins, and Death awaits if I fail.

<p>
(A RUM S F BLA-SEV):  Just hopin' for an NMR, Kent...  No reason...

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE SULTAN):
Your eminence.
Za High Command has concluded zat inorder for za Austrian 2nd, 
army group to survive total annihilation,it must make a
calculated risk.
Za results should come quickly,and hopefully painlessly to 
za both of us.
Perhaps vee can come to some sort of mutual cease fire? 
Vee vill vait until za smoke settles...

<p>
(ITALY to BOARD): Go easy on me now, boys.  I'm a novice at this
stuff.
<i>((Oh yeah, RIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTT!!!!))</i> 

<p>
(BARNO to MUNSON IF YOU EVENTUALLY LOOK AT THIS ONLINE):  Boy this would
have been a lot easier with you as my buddy to get revenge on the
Austrian madman for starting his crusade.  But now I have a LAWYER in
your spot.  Should I promise him a percentage of any dots he helps me
recover?  It was so much easier when we had face-to-face drinking (etc)
rowdiness history as a motivation.     

<p>
(FRANCE): What the hell?!?! Munson stabs everyone on the planet, lies to me 
every year and then bails?? SHEEEESSSHH.  And then we get Emmert as a 
replacement.  Jim-Bob you have the soul of a grave digger.  MY GOD MAN!
<i>((Hee, hyork, hyork, hyork....))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): Well, the Spiders just might get into
the Big Dance after all; they won 10 out of their last 11 to finish 21-6,
and they're done until the tournament - even if it's the NIT.  If most of
the mid-major tournaments go as forecast (i.e., no upsets producing
surprise entrants in addition to the regular-season champs), then they
have a shot.  I also saw one projection the other day that had SEVEN teams
each from the SEC and the Big East.  Isn't this thing getting a little
topheavy?

<p>
(BOOB to LAWYER): See above, they were judged to be ``just out".
Their strength of schedule was just TOO low to make it in, even if they were
23-4 or so - was it only 21-6??
But in many ways, it was THE disappointment of the day, it just wasn't fair
because they weren't totally at fault for being cast out of conference
and no one would play them.
I hope they go on to win the NIT!

<p>
1) The RAG draw is reproposed.  Please vote on it with your Fall orders.
No vote received is still an automatic no.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EMMERT to JAMES): ``Sorry buddy"?  ``SORRY BUDDY"?  You knife me in the
<i>((Expletive deleted))</i> 
back AGAIN, and all I get is a lousy ``Sorry buddy"?  Hey, Jim-Bob,
I'd like to sign up for any game Drew is in.  If there's a standby call for
anything he's playing in, I'll pay you double the usual bribe to get me in,
preferably right behind him.
<i>((Right-o, as soon as you get me some lawyers to fill the lawyers game.
Until then, and after that OTHER standby position, YOU owe ME!))</i>

<p>
(I/T to BOARD): We who are about to die salute you.

<p>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND): While I appreciate the offer to toady, you might take
note that I already have one, and he's really not doing very well.  Sure
about that?

<p>
(TURKISH CORPSE-TO-BE; MEMO TO SELF): Do not go gentle into that good night;
old age should burn and rage at close of day; rage, rage against the dying
of the light.  Besides, if Rauterberg dies at the same time, you can settle
down over a beer and cuss at each other.

<p>
Not that this will be of much interest in So Good circles, but for your own
sake, I should let you know that I'll be moving in about a month.  Starting
about March 30, the new mailing address will be 3317 Hershridge Road, VB

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): You got one at the head of the szine,
that will do for this issue! 
There's PLENTY of press below!!    

<p>
(SPANISH NEWS): Due to national security the press of national Spanish
Tribune we were unable to determine why Spain took Lib a former Egyptian
center and no commander of the 6th army group would comment after the 
holding or attack into Lib.

<p>
Though we the people of Spain rejoice in the manufacture of yet another
fleet that was recently launched into the port at Sve lead by Admiral Steven
Wesker was interviewed this morning after launching the fleet into the port.
   
<p>
In the Interview, reporter Susan B. Anthony asked in what direction would
this fleet be headed. Admiral Steven Wesker only said ``We haven't received
any orders yet of which way to go with Italy's attempted thrust into Gol a
former French water shore which is now a Spanish sea again. Though the
attack didn't succeed there are that I know of some doubts in the Spanish
people that Italy will stay true to the treaty of The Barconleria Islands
that lay in the gol."
When Steven Wesker was asked on his predictions of what his orders would be
he only said, ``It is anyone's guess."

<p>
(SPANISH DAILY TRIBUNE): At 5:00 a.m. fall of 2004 Ukrainian armies atacked
Izm and Ser while Italy counter attacked and overrun Hun a Ukrainian staging
point into Ser and attacked Ist and received no resistance in former Turkey
where Sultan Kent Pollard ruled till 1998. Spanish Ambassador returned to
Spain this morning from Berlin in talks with the German Foreign Minister.
When asked what were the talks about he only commented, ``The talks were over
the British attacks into Swe and Den and is now on top of Hamburg and that
Germany forces vowed to hold the forces of Ukraine and Britain off as long    
as they can."
   
<p>
In the latest news President Sean F. O'Donnell visited Cai to see
President Jeff O'Donnell though it was stated there is only a little chance
of relativity. The talks are only known to be secret since Italian forces
continued aggression in the fall of 2004.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG ``OBEY AND CONFUSED''): I received a communique from the
Ferengi requesting a peace treaty with the Federation and the Klingons.
I did not feel I could trust the Ferengi ambassador, so I ordered Mr. Sulu
and the Starship Excelsior to attack, and hopefully cut the Ferengi supply
line in anticipation of a convoy attack on a Klingon starbase.
Not only did the Ferengi not attack the Klingon starbase but they attempted
to move out of the neutral zone back to Ferengi space as promised.
This is the first time that they have ever kept their word.
My attack of their supply line stopped their withdrawal and might even damage
future Ferengi/Federation relations. 
To make matters worse, the Romulans have attacked the Ferengi with force and
cutting the Ferengi supply line will help the Romulans immensely.
The Romulans gained 4 star bases in their conquest of outer Ferengi but committed
a severe tactical blunder by not obliterating the Ferengi last starbase and 
starship at the center of the Romulan wormhole.  The Romulans could have
exterminated the Ferengi perimeter, but now will have to deal with a Ferengi
presence behind their lines.
The Ferengi have also signed an alliance with Cardassia against the Romulans.
They both lost starships and starbases but they did manage to scuttle one front
line Romulan Bird of Prey and retake one starbase to cut their losses.

<p>
I got a brief visit from ``Q''.
He complained about the Federation's primitive sub-space communication array and
questioned my ``intelligence''.
I don't think there is anything I can do with current resources to improve 
communication with an omnipotent all knowing all seeing all powerful (all
arrogant) entity.
As for my intelligences, after my complete blundering of a potential Ferengi 
alliance, I can only respond to ``Q'' by saying, ``Touch&#233;''.

<p>
(SPANISH DAILY BUGLE): Every country is in the grips of WW3. Even though war
was inevitable in this day in age there is a major surprise that all the
world is at war, but the Borg the race of conguest decided to sit this war
out, or perhaps in hopes of finding a weaker country to take star bases
from.

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Last act of defiance ok, but you would be in better position
had you decided to move there instead.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): Kirk looked at the panel in front of him and every percentage
was dropping fast. So he did the only thing he could think of. ``Scottie we
need more power!"

<p>
``I'm giving her all I got, captain. If I push her any harder she gonna blow.''

<p>
(GERMANY-UKRAINE): Don't you have some explaining to do!
                                                       
<p>
(KENT-JEFF): Why are you trying to be me? More to the point, you're an idiot
O'Donnell.

<p>
(ITALY-EGYPT): Uncle Jeffy I thought you were going to support me into
Istanbul and move out of the Ion to let me in.

<p>
(BRITAIN-GERMANY): Why, I believe I attacked you. I'm sorry I thought you were
Ukraine.

<p>
(UKRAINE-GERMANY): Don't worry, our top notch Lawyers and accountants are
almost to Berlin.

<p>
(ITALY-GERMANY): HELP!

<p>
(SPAIN-BOARD): I'm a moron and everybody knows it.
<i>((That's hardly fair, you're not even giving us a chance....))</i>              
          
<p>
(SPAIN-GM): The news was speechless only because I couldn't think of anything 
worth saying.
<i>((What's all this, then???))</i>
Then again since when didn't anyone think what I said in the press was worth 
saying anyhow..

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN AND GERMANY): Gee I think I got problems and both results in my 
future elimination.

<p>
(GERMANY-SPAIN): We're enemies.

<p>
(SPAIN-BOARD): Does anyone want to order a pizza?

<p>
(SPANISH NEWS WINTER 2005): Admiral Will St. John of the 3rd fleet was 
interviewed this morning and was asked several questions such as why did 
Italy attack the gulf where the fleet is holding.

<p>
``The only thought I myself have is that they wanted to try one of two things 
if they didn't trust the Spanish President to be an ally then they'd make 
Gol thus obliterating this entire fleet. The second is that they are aligned 
with Ukraine and was just trying to get into the gol to use as a staging 
point to remove the Wme the 10th fleet, or they would support Germany into 
Bar or cut the eastern armies support to enter Nav and then have a major 
drive possibly straight into Mad the capital which if memory serves me right 
the French armies held Mad or Bar I forget for sure which."
   
<p>
When asked of the possibility tensions will regain war, Admiral Will St. 
John guessed, ``Well if Italy continues to make tensions high then there is a 
slight chance that we would in fact go back to war, but to prevent that then 
Italy would have to remove the Italian fleet in Lig to ensure that Italy is 
not threatening the Spanish homelands."

<p>
(SPANISH NATIONAL INQUIRER): The start of this World War since tensions 
mounted first with Britain under Prime Minister Jonas Johnson with President 
or at the time Commander Sean O'Donnell who originally was going to ally with 
Britain against President Harry Andruschak,
who instead seemed like a better bargain for an ally with Britain being 
above and under the Spanish homeland. Though while tensions mounted before 
the war actually got under way Czar Rich Goranson. 
Talked to the President of Spain to attack Britain. Though at that 
current time the arrangements were more anti-French in league with Italy, 
Britain, and Germany, but President Sean O'Donnell saw more danger in 
Britain then he did in France so he realigned himself with the French 
President. Meanwhile while tensions was mounting President Sean O'Donnell 
also talked to Egypt of the Sultan's status with her neighbors and was told 
that Egypt would align with Turkey and that she would align with Spain if it 
was warranted.
   
<p>
As well, tensions mounted in Poland under President Roland who worried of 
an Ukrainian attack into Poland.
Though, if memory serves the news right, Poland and Ukraine allied and 
started swiping into Russia with I believe Britain??
   
<p>
During the late 1990's starting actually in 1995 war erupted all over the 
world as armies seized provinces and declared war on other countries.
By 2000, for sure, France had already been eliminated followed by Poland and then a 
massive backstab and attack by Italy, Ukraine, and Egypt eliminating Turkey 
out of the fight and shortly later Russia  to the present years from the 
massive war against Germany then against Ukraine, Italy, and Germany to a 
more evened number war G/I vs B/U and E/S vs I and to the moment G/I VS B/U 
leaving Egypt defending his waters from possible Italian and Ukrainian 
thrusts into Egypt where if Ukraine does it he'll be in the position to win 
the war practically solo since from there he can possably swipe into Italy 
and maybe Germany definitely into Germany with British aid which leaves 
Spain very much in the middle of two vultures and one major war machine in 
the north while Germany is pinned down after the fall's attacks into Sweden 
and Denmark.

<p>
(SEAN-BOARD): Who else will be eliminated, who else will be on the defensive, 
who is going to survive, and who is going to live in modern SURVIVOR.
(No discounts, no substitutes, and no refunds).

<p>
(SEAN-NUKES): Come here, come here. Boom! ``I need a bath I'm all charred 
black.."
