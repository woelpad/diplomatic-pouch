Flip Flop press:

(Sean-Boob): No problem, I'm just not taking the game seriously within the 
Diplomacy theme. Any objection if Jeff does join that I pre-empt an assault 
against Jeff? It would be hard to nuke Jeff when he isn't in the game.... 
=/.


Spirals of Paranoia:

(Sean-Eric and Paul): Looks like that you two will achieve what I have not 
been able to achieve by the map situation....

(Sean-Jeff): Way to go Stosh!

Phil Reynolds:

(Sean-Malice): I can think of someone else that is trying to rival Jim-Bob 
with the press.

(Sean-Star Trek poster): You do realize that you are giving out tactical 
data when you send out the Star Trek Press right?

     from Sean

(Sean O'Donnell-Germany and Italy): I been thinking. Maybe, I was a little 
harsh. Ok, you beat me to the punch, but I really should thank you for 
knocking Jeff flat in this game. By all means, roast him toast him and feed 
him to the birds. So, thank you for being able to do something that I have 
yet to accomplish so far in my gaming career.

(Sean-Jeff): Your other dear Diplomacy playing nephew is in real trouble. 
He's England, and I'm Germany. France has A Yor, A Bel, A Bur, F Nao, F Ech, 
F Wal, and F GoL. He has F Nrg, A Cly, F Lon, and F Nth. I have F Nwy, F 
Kie, A Hol, A Ruh, and A Mun. Italy has A Vie, A Tyr, A Apu, F Tun, and F 
Nap. Austria has F Ion, A Bud, A Tri, A Ser, and A War. Turkey has F Aeg, A 
Smy, A Rum, and F Bla. Russia has A Mos, A Ukr, and A Lvn. France owns Par, 
Bre, Mar, Spa, Por, and Liv (Liverpool), England owns Nwy, Hol, Lon, and 
Edi, Italy owns Tun, Nap, Ven, Rom, and Vie, Russia owns Stp, Mos, and Sev, 
Austria owns Bud, Tri, War, Rum, Ser, and Gre, Turkey owns Con, Smy, and 
Ank, and I own Swe, Kie, Mun, Ber, and Den. This should help you piece 
together the results of S04. It's a real pity that you're not England in 
this game. Do you think that you two can trade places?

(Sean-Jim-Bob): Out of curiousity, Ragging on family members is a tradition, 
so do I really need to rag on you to? If so, you're more than welcome to 
take over for my cousin in that game too.

    from Sean
