Well, now!  Oh, no!  Not again.  Yes, I my previous  computer, less than six 
months old, became contaminated with all of my  protection, and had to be 
replaced for this monster.  None the less, this  expensive, new computer frooze.  
I tried a dirty install [overwriting with  the Windows XP program, and that 
caused problems, so I did a clean install,  restoring the computer back to the 
time I took it out of the box.  Had a  lot of problems and had to call on my 
son.  Back again, and seems to be  working fine.
 
France, Spring 1905
 
France to England:  Okay, be a pest.  But you will not even slow  down my 
advance.  That is the problem with starting the game insisting this  and that.  I 
never could bend over for tyrants.

effective.]
