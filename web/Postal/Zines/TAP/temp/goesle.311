Jim-Bob,

The good news is:  it appears that what was on Curt Schilling's sock in =
Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS was blood.

The bad news is:  it was Jimmy Hoffa's blood.

Cheers!

Goz

Nathan has a mile of track, but not Thomas scale.  He's got some 
Fisher-Price set, with something like 10 remote-controlled engines and 
enough cars, scenery, etc. to cover maybe half a state's worth.  We can't 
set the whole thing up in any one room.  We've been able to connect the 
entire upstairs with it before Carol caught us once.
