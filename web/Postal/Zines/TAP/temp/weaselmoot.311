Hi Jim(s).  The Windy City Weasels are having a DipCon next month.  The details follow.  We're hoping 3-4 boards per round.  If anyone is from the midwest and can join us, we may beat that.  Can you put this in the next TAP of its out before June 1?

I've copied Jim O'Kelley on this in case you two have never connected.

Calling All Weasels!
The Windy City Weasels’ Tournament Committee cordially invites you to attend Weasel Moot I (you have to start somewhere!), a three-round Diplomacy tournament to be held June 9 and 10 in Chicago.
 
What? A three-round Diplomacy tournament, and the sixth stop on the North American Diplomacy Federation’s 2007 Grand Prix Circuit.
 
When? June 9 and 10, 2007.
 
Where? At the breathtaking Elks Veterans Memorial, 2750 N Lakeview Ave.,Chicago, IL 60614. Don’t believe it’s breathtaking? Check out these links. We’ll be playing the games in these rooms!
 
http://elks.org/memorial/VirtualTour/Elks-gr.html
http://elks.org/memorial/VirtualTour/ElksMemorialRotunda.htm
 
Cool venue AND free parking on site!
 
Who? The Windy City Weasels is a Chicago area club dedicated to the play of the classic boardgame Diplomacy. We’ve been organizing games since September 2005. This is our club’s first annual (we hope) tournament.
 
Traveling Diplomacy players Jim O’Kelley, Greg Duenow and Jeremiah Peterson, along with Chicago’s most honest lawyer, Thom Comstock, comprise the Tournament Committee. O’Kelley will serve as Tournament Director.
 
How Much: The preregistration fee is $35, payable by PayPal to Thom Comstock at Redpawn3@yahoo.com. Just provide your name and mention Weasel Moot when you send the funds. We’ll charge $40 at the door.
 
Schedule:
Saturday, June 9
Round 1
Registration: 9 to 9:30 a.m.
Round Begins: 9:45 a.m.
 
Round 2
Registration: 5:15 to 5:45 p.m.
Round Begins: 6 p.m.
 
Round 1 and 2 games must be completed by a time known only to the tournament director between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.
 
Sunday, June 10
Round 3
Registration: 8:15 to 8:45 a.m.
Round Begins: 9 a.m.
 
Round 3 will end at a time known only to the tournament director between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.
 
The awards ceremony will begin 15 minutes after the end of round 3.
 
Speaking of awards, what can I win? We’ll award plaques for first through seventh place and some of the coolest Best Country awards you’ll ever see. Plus, there might be a few surprises…
 
And how will said awards be determined? We’ll be using a draw-based scoring system with a center-count component. It will be either David Hood’s time-tested DixieCon scoring system or a modified version to give more weight to solos. Each player’s two best rounds will count for score. Players need only play in one round to be eligible for awards.
 
Housing? We have a limited supply of rooms at the Days Inn Lincoln Park North, which is two blocks from the tournament site, for the evenings of June 8 and 9. These rooms range in price from $162 per night to $180 per night and can hold two to four people, depending on the room. To make your reservation, call 1-888-LPN DAYS by May 14. Our rooms are being held under the name Weasel Moot.
 
If you’re looking for a cheaper housing alternative, contact Jim O’Kelley at jimthegrey1013@yahoo.com. He has space available in two junior suites at the Best Western Hawthorne Terrace Hotel, which is about five blocks from the tournament site, for the evenings of June 8 and 9. Each suite can accommodate up to five people. Space will be available for $55 per person per night, assuming five people per suite.
 
And if you want something even less expensive, contact Jim. He’ll attempt to connect you with a local host. 
 
Anything else? Well, if there’s sufficient interest, we’re going to organize a White Sox outing for Friday night. So, let us know if you’re interested! Also, we’re probably going to serve Chicago-style pizza in between rounds on Saturday. 
 
Questions? Contact Tournament Director Jim O’Kelley at jimthegrey1013@yahoo.com. For more information about the Windy City Weasels, check out our Yahoo group at games.groups.yahoo.com/group/ChicagoDip/ or our new website at umbreho.dyndns.org/wcw.

  Can't remember if I told you this already, but Don Williams booked his flight to Chicago for Weasel Moot. Edi Birsan and Buffalo also have booked their flights. 
   
  Weasel Moot will be a three-round tournament, with two rounds on June 9 and one on June 10. Any chance you can make it?
