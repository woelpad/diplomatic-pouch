Jim,

Not sure I like this any better than before...  (I know what you're thinking: 
This guy complains no matter what!)

So I guess my choices are blow away my tiny cards for squat, blow away some of
my middling cards for the same squat, or take a gamble on blowing away a
highcard for the chance to cripple a rider in exchange for maybe getting ten
points at the first sprint line (or maybe just crippling him, without the
points)?

Maybe I should quit playing this thing now that a couple of other guys have
figured out how to play it...

Anyway, just to get something in:

Play each of my riders' lowest card.

I'm sure that'll get me nothing but four of a kind: all threes!  Well, if I'm
only getting squat, might as well pay the least amount for it.  ;)

Thanks!

Best wishes,

Tom
