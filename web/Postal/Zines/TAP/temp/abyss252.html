All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
The next <i>Tinamou</i> deadline still should be November 19, 2001; but David
may choose to move it to the 26th, after this delay.
<i>Tinamou</i> finally arrived in time for this issue.

<p><br><p><br>Yes, this is late again because of my job related issues that many of you
know about.
I do have two jobs, both of which are ``officially'' full time and sometimes
both act that way.
Of course, I could officially be declared a masochist, since I only really
get paid once for the ``higher salary'' one, so I must love it.... and
I do, but sometimes....
I finally decided to push the deadline back to compensate, the new game
players in ``I Can't Find My Money!'' should pay close attention to that,
since that changes the deadline I already announced to them.
This is sure to lighten up a bit in the Spring, but I'm still going to
try to slip two deadlines in before Christmas.
Hang with me everyone, thanks!

<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per

Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My Red Sox team finished very strong, just short of .500 and I am ready
for next year, with my brilliant pitching and defense.
I just need two or three hitters.
Kathy Byrne Caruso's Mets JUST barely defeated Dick Martin's 
Baltimore Orioles to win our World Series.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW NEW PLAYERS!!
Contact John Caruso at commishjohn of att.net or me for more details.
I think we have three or four teams left open at the moment.
 
<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter is unlikely to be starting any new games in the <i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 
I think we have Rip Gooch as the representative volunteer, but he will
get back to me around Christmas to decide for sure.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR BILL QUINN</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Bill Quinn was the Boardman Number Custodian in the mid-1980's and won the
Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service to the Hobby in 1986.
More specifically, he was Publisher of <i>Everything</i> during the 
Don Ditter and Kathy Byrne Caruso Custodianships (issue numbers 53-62)
and then took over the Boardman Number Custodianship itself from 
August 1984 to August 1986.
Bill was known for his efforts to organize the BNC records and as
a tireless worker at the task, during a period of one of the highest
rates of game starts in the history of the position.
Naturally, Bill burned out on this eventually and has dropped out of sight.
I think it is time to find him again.... you have until Issue #255!!
Action on the search for's has been lagging lately, use the Internet
for something, search for people!!
The name ``Bill Quinn" only generates 2,630 hits on Google and ``Al 
Pearson'' only generates 728!!
You'll really kick yourself if the AREA person named Al Pearson is the
one that I'm looking for, for example and you can track him down pretty
easily.
Ask our AREA Diplomacy pal Glenn Petroski, gelp of juno.com, if you don't know what
AREA is.....

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<p>
<p>Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Goes ON!!

<p>
The second round is now over.  This year a large number of
players went on to Round 2, before they narrowed to the Semi-Final Round
of Seven games to determine who goes to the Finals. 
Prominent semifinalists include: David Malloch (one of last year's finalists),
Paraic ``Fred'' Reddington (tall Irish elfin Diplomat as hard as nails!),
Jack Brawner (best known as Dick Martin's childhood pal), Paul Riley (GM
extraordinaire who proves he can play too!!), Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu
(I'm learning Norwegian so I can talk to him and Frank Johansen in their
own language... my first E-Mails to Joe were more or less understandable),
Yann Clouet (one of France's greatest exports to the English speaking world),
Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira (extremely, even by Dipping standards, arrogant
Brazilian... don't let him bowl you over), Thomas Franke (long acknowledged
as the best German player in the world, showing he's not washed up),
Stephen Agar (my <i>Diplomacy World</i> co-editor is showing he can
play the game with finesse!), Fearghal ``Twerg'' O'Donnchu (the Irish
wildman!!), Christian Dreyer (winner of tournaments and demo games,
extremely dangerous!), Brian Dennehy (wow, he is just a great player,
not second in any book of mine), Jody McCullough (yes, our very own Bay
Area whiz!), Frank Johansen (the aforementioned other Norwegian and the
President of the Norwegian Diplomacy Association), and Chetan Radia
(he of the only 18 center win at this summer's World DipCon). 
Expect this Tournament not to end for another year, though we are obviously
already well into 2001.
The next tournament in the series will be WorldMasters 2002, starting sometime
next year.

A DIP_AT_SEA_ADVENTURE UPDATE FROM LARRY PEERY</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
If you want all the background and blow by blow details of the first 
Dip_at_Sea_Adventure (DSAI) you'll need to read my reports in <i>DW</i>, 
<i>TDP</i> 
(There is still a <i>TDP</i> isn't there?), and perhaps on the IDS web site 
when I get around to posting them.
In the meantime here's a few thoughts for the Burgess Chapter of the 
Hobby Old Farts Association (HOFA).

<p>
The first DSA proved, conclusively I would say, that a Diplomacy 
gaming event (call it a Con or whatever) held on board a cruise ship is 
perfectly viable from the perspective of the ship's facilities, the 
ship's staff, and the other passengers.  The only real remaining 
challenge is persuading Dip players to get off their land locked butts 
and onto a cruise ship!

<p>
There are both pros and cons to having a world class (and I wouldn't 
want such an event to be anything but world class) Diplomacy event at 
sea.  The pros are the same ones traditionally applied to cruising.  The 
cons are also the same ones traditionally applied to cruising.  I 
mention this because otherwise there really is very little difference 
between having a Con on a **** star cruise ship and having it at a nice 
resort hotel.   The one big difference is the obvious one. The ship 
moves at about 20 mph, the land-based resort doesn't, so on a cruise you 
can visit from three to ten ports of call depending on the length of the 
cruise.  Otherwise there just isn't much difference.

<p>
At first glance the cruise may appear more expensive than a 
traditional DipCon, but on closer examination I don't think that's 
true- if you compare events of equal quality.  A cruise ship event 
will cost anywhere from $75 to $300 per person per day, depending on the 
quality of the ship and what's included.  Basically that includes 
housing, eats, and entertainment. Beverages (e.g. booze), shore 
excursions, tips, and things like gambling are obviously extra.  
Obviously for $300 a day you get a lot nicer package than you do for 
$75, but for at least the next several years there are going to be some 
excellent cruise values that could host a Dip event for less than $100 a 
day.  But if you're the kind of  Dipper that wants to sit around 
somebody's living  room for three days, sleeping on the floor, sharing a 
single bathroom, and living on huge amounts of warm beer and cold pizza; 
then a world class Dip cruise event isn't your cup of tea; and frankly 
you probably aren't the kind of person I'd want along on a cruise 
anyway. :-)  But if you'd like to combine a Dip event with some 
interesting sight-seeing and be able to bring your family along for a 
nice holiday; a Dip cruise event makes perfect sense. But enough on that 
subject.

<p>
I can't think of any event I've seen at a land-based Dip Con that 
couldn't be provided by an at sea event, and there are some things that 
a land-based event can't offer.  When was the last time you had a 
negotiating period extended so the players could go watch a pod of 
whales or school of dolphins swim by the gaming room?

<p>
Now that DSAI is history I'm already at work on preparing for the 
second DSA.  Once again I doubt if there will be too many land-based 
Dippers attending but, if things go as well on the QEII as they did on 
the RYNDAM, it should be a very nice event.  I expect the QEII event 
will folllow the same pattern as the RYNDAM one, only with more playing 
periods and perhaps a bit more class.  After all, the QEII is a true 
*****-star cruise ship.  At least Cunard says so.  Besides the 
difference in the ships (The QEII is much older, but not as old as Edi 
and my Diplomacy careers.) and passenger make-up, the biggest difference 
will be in the itineraries. The RYNDAM 10 day cruise to Mexico that I 
took in October had six port call days in ten days, leaving only 3 days 
at sea.  The QEII 22 day cruise from Los Angeles to Sydney will include 
six or seven port call days in the twenty-two days, leaving 14 or 15 
days at sea.  That will allow for more time for playing Dip.  Imagine 
having the first round ending in Hawaii, the second round ending in 
Tahiti, the third round ending in New Zealand, and the last round ending 
in Australia. Each round spread generously over a four day period with 
plenty of time for other activities.   No doubt the staff of the QEII 
will do as much or more as the staff of the RYNDAM did to make us happy. 

<p>
Perhaps the biggest difference between DSAI and DSAII is that I took 
one gameboard on the RYNDAM not knowing what to expect.  I plan to take 
three on the QEII and I just hope that's enough.  But if it isn't I'm 
sure the ship's print shop can make me another gameboard and the chef 
can come up with another set of pieces. 

<p>
If you'll be at WDC in Canberra you'll get a report, of course.  I 
plan to stay on in Oz after the QEII arrives in Sydney in mid-February.  
I'll spend the next six weeks touring Tasmania, the northern triangle, 
and the Oz wine country before heading off to Canberra.  I've always 
wanted to play Dip with a 'roo and a croc!  Look for reports in the 
hobby press or on the Dip_at_Sea_Adventures web site. 

<p>
For those of you who can't make the DSAII cruise or the Canberra WDC 
event I suggest you start planning for the third DSA!  It will be held 
later next year.  I don't want to give away all the details (or else 
some hobbyists' wife/travel agent will steal my idea) but I can tell you 
DSAIII will feature a week cruise in the Caribbean aboard one of the 
world's newest, largest cruise ships. The total package, including an 
air allowance, will come in at less than $1,000 per person.  You can't 
beat it, so why not plan to join us?

But, I now am QUITE sure that Larry is being a great ambassador for the

Cruises aren't my kind of thing, although I've thought about taking one of
those ``working ship'' cruises that are around out there, so I realized
that was MY reaction to the idea.  
But Diplomacy actually is a PERFECT event for a cruise.

DipCon Newsletter #1 - Dixiecon 16</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Memorial Day Weekend 2002, Chapel Hill, North Carolina

<p>
David Hood, 1969 12th St Pl NE, Hickory NC 28601, David_Hood of w3link.com

<p>
SUMMARY: The Carolina Amateur Diplomats again will host the 2002 Dipcon,  in
conjunction with Dixiecon 16.  Dixiecon is the longest-running Diplomacy
tournament site in North America, and has a proven track record for
attracting the top players on this continent and beyond.  A primary
selling point for Dixiecon is that the top-notch calibre of the players
who attend on a yearly basis leads to a challenging venue for
Championship competition.  Here are other highlights of the Dipcon at
Dixiecon experience, in summary fashion:

<p>
* Diplomacy games at Dixiecon do not have a time limit (except for the
last round), and are played until there is a win, stalemate demonstrable
to the GM, or unanimously voted result.  We believe this leads to a more
natural resolution of most games, and gives time for wins to occur if
the potential is there, unlike the situation in tournaments which must
operate with time limits.

<p>
* The costs of the Dixiecon event are relatively low, at an estimated
$18 per night to share a double room, and $18 registration fee.  Unlike
some Dixiecons in the past, the venue is now held at a private dormitory
with superior facilities to the old location as well as immediate access
to food and, um, entertainment on adjoining Franklin Street in downtown
Chapel Hill.

<p>
* A Dipcon can be held very successfully as a part of a larger games
convention.  On the other hand, at Dixiecon, Diplomacy is the focus of
most of what goes on, which leads to a very special and meaningful event
designed to lead to the formation of lasting real-life alliances (i.e.
friendships.)  The success of this approach can be seen in the
relationships forged amongst the Dixiecon faithful over 15 prior events,
including the hosting of the 1990 and 1998 Dipcon/World Dipcon events
and the 1994 Dipcon.

<p>AWARDS

<p>
Awards at Dixiecon/Dipcon generally include plaques for the Top Board,
Best Country plaques color-coded for each of the seven powers,
certificates for the ancillary boardgame events, and the special awards
for the Golden Blade (best stabbing performace), the Hammered Award
(best stabbee performance), the Brick (just plain poor play over the
weekend) and the Player’s Choice Award (most popular player of the
weekend as voted by the particpants).  The Awards are given out shortly
after time is called on the last round on Sunday afternoon.  This year
will begin Dixiecon’s participation in the Eastern Swing, a
four-tournament ``quadruple crown'' in which players’ scores at Prezcon
(Feb), Dixiecon (May), WBC (Aug) and Tempest (Oct) will be scored
together to crown an Eastern Swing Champion and Top Board.

<p>
<p>TOURNAMENT SCORING

<p>
* Dixiecon uses a scoring system which gives points for a win, 2nd
place, etc.  Draw participants share the points for the combined value
of the places involved in the draw, i.e. a three way draw shares the
points for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.  Draws are usually preferable to
coming in second to a win unless you are talking about five-way or
higher draw, and who cares about that!  The points for winning are much
more than the points for any other results, obviously.

<p>
* Concessions and draws need not include all surviving players, but such
results must pass unanimously by secret ballot and cannot be voted on
until AFTER FALL 1905.

<p>
* The tournament has four rounds (when we host Dipcon, otherwise we just
have three).  One must play in at least two rounds to be eligible for

Jim Boob,
Okay you convinced me I'll sign up for your 7x7 Nuclear Yuppie Evil
Empire game start.
<i>((Great, that fills it, we'll start next time!!))</i>

<p>
Movies: I only saw one this year Planet of the Apes with the guy
from Boogie Nights whose name I can't recall. I liked the movie but the
ending was stupid. I may go see Zoolander and Training Day.
<i>((Wow, what a DOG to choose as your movie of the year, <b>Zoolander</b>
is just tremendously hilarious!!))</i>

<p>
I have been impressed with the Tom Hanks/Steve Spielberg series on
HBO Band of Brothers. The two episodes I have seen have been very realistic.
I have no idea where they got real Jagdpanzers as they were built in limited
numbers to begin with but they do have them. I was also impressed by the
accurate German half tracks, the famous Sdfzk 251 with various mounts
(machine guns, 20 mm guns, 37 mm guns, 75 mm guns.)
<i>((One would, of course, have to first possess cable, and then possess
HBO, in order to see this, neither of which describes me, but I've heard
similar things around....))</i>

<p>
I have been disappointed by some America's reactions to September
11. The current ``Patriot" Bill is a major reason for that disappointment.
This is a bill full of police state tactics, including several like ``Know
Your Customer" bank spying provision and the ever popular e-mail snooping
Carnivore, were rejected by previous bills or administrations. Now the law
enforcement establishment, led by the Justice department and FBI, can't wait
to shove them down our throats. 
<i>((Indeed, quite scary, especially since I thought all along that the
anthrax scare was being caused by a Unabomber type right-wing nutcase,
not Osama bin Laden related terrorists, and that seems to be coming true.
I think in retrospect we will be seen as WAY overreacting on that front.))</i>

<p>
Another problem I have is with all of these pseudo security measures
that do nothing for security and just invade people's privacy and simply
lengthen the time to get on board an airplane. It is also spreading beyond
the airport. 
For example, I work at a chemical plant and they are now stopping trucks so
they can inspect them before they come on to the plant. But have they
trained the guards on what to look for? No. Do they search anywhere inside
the vehicle? No. So what is the point of this? It looks reassuring but is it
effective? I seriously doubt it.
<i>((Ditto....))</i>	

<p>
I read a great article from the Delaware Libertarian Party group on
the difference between effective security and ineffective security-I'll
forward it to you. This article also highlights another idiotic idea from
our friends in law enforcement. The government wants curbs put on
cryptographic software so that they, the government, can read our files and
e-mail. This is like banning locks so it is easier for the government to
serve you with a search warrant. Not only is will this make our networks and
computers less secure to the very terrorist the government claims they want
to catch but it assumes that we can control this kind of technology. As if
we can stop this technology by ignoring it.

<p>
I also agreed with you about what you said about the West Bank and
the viability of Israeli settlements there. As Mr. Spiel's reaction proved,
there are some Americans who don't think the settlements are an issue.  I
wonder what their reaction would be if the UK were taking land from
Catholics in Northern Ireland and settling Protestants on it? Humans have
been pretty mobile in the course of history and most land was currently
owned by some other tribe or group, I am very hesitant to base any type of
land claim on a previous group living there. Where will something like that
end?

Dear Jim,
I did mean to congratulate you on reaching 250 issues, even if it's a bit 
belated now.
I thought more people would have written in about September 11 for your 
October issue.  But it was long with all your Diplomacy stuff anyway.
<i>((Yeah, I wasn't complaining, and this one is long with lots of 
subszines.))</i>

<p>
I heard all the events from the planes hitting the WTC to the tower collapses 
on the radio, since I was driving to an errand north of Baltimore at the 
time.  After a while I suspected it might be a War of the Worlds type hoax 
that NPR was playing.  Switching stations refuted that theory.  When the 
announcer said that Tower #2 was completely gone, I didn't believe it.  I'd 
been there.  There way no way that building was gone.  I thought he couldn't 
see the building because of the cloud of dust he was describing.  It must 
have been more shocking to see it live on TV as it was happening, since the 
pictures left no room for disbelief.

<p>
Anyway, driving north on I-95, the message board said ``Major Problems - New 
York City - Avoid the Region".  When I went back south it said ``Major 
Problems - Washington DC - Avoid the Region".  For a minute I thought maybe 
I should just park my car in the middle of I-95.

<p>
My gut instinct is against getting into a war, but I can't come up with a 
good argument against the way Bush is handling this.  He does seem to realize 
that only a small number of Afghans are behind the terrorists, and that the 
country needs massive humanitarian aid.  The terrorist organization does need 
to be broken up for our own self defense.

Seattle's in big trouble.  I thought last night's game was a

In predicting the playoffs, I may have let my anti-Yankee bias color
things.  Still, had the A's not fallen apart in Game 5 defensively,
they still could have won.  But I think the Yankees might be in one
of those ``We're on a mission from God" modes.

Subject: Red Sox baseball

<p>
I have been thinking a lot about what I would do if I were the new
owner.

<p>
a) Fire Duquette.  Don't know who the replacement would be, but Duke
has gotta go.  He is terrible for organization chemistry.
<i>((Yeah, if he stays he is going to keep trying, and trying,
and trying to rehabilitate Carl Everett and driving the Red Sox
clubhouse further into ruin.))</i>

<p>
b) Get new medical staff.  The Sox medical staff have made HUGE
mistakes.  Who was telling Pedro to pitch in August??

<p>
c) Bring back Mo!  It still amazes me that Duke could run Mo out of
town and bring in Carl Everett instead.  

<p>
d) Re-sign Nomo, use Lowe as a starter and Urbina as the closer.

<p>
That gives 

<p>
a) very strong players at SS, LF, #1 starter

<p>
b) strong players at 1B, CF(Nixon), C

<p>
c) they can fill in the rest with role players.  They really need
a big bat at 3B or 1B.  

<p>
Mostly, though, the whole organization needs an enema.  Duke has
trashed a lot of the inner workings of the lower levels of the
organization.  They'll need to build that back up to be a long-term
threat for anything.  With Pedro, Nomar, and Manny they are
immediately a threat if...

<p>
Jim-Bob,

<p>
An interesting WS.  Congrats to the Diamondbacks, one of perhaps as many as
4 non-Yankee teams that will win a title this decade.  The Yankees came
within 2 outs of winning a 7-game WS while scoring only 14 runs.  My initial
conclusion is that Torre doesn't get enough credit, despite the payroll he's
working with.  Somehow they managed to win 11 post-season series in a row,
which takes more than money.

<p>
Don't cry for the Yankees, even though O'Neill, Martinez, and others will
leave this off-season.  They won't rebuild, they'll just reload, like usual.
Giambi?  Bonds?  Perhaps one particular team might even get rid of one of
their malcontents (in line with many of their recent personnel decisions)
and a chap named ``Pedro" will wind up in pinstripes.  I dibs the Yankees
again in '02.

<p>
In other news I've noticed that, since 11 September, there has been no talk
of a strike or labor action against MLB.  This got me to thinking, and so I
looked closely at a computerized picture of bin Laden.  Take away the
turbin, shave the beard, put him in an ill-fitting suit, and put glasses on
him.  Can that really be Bud Selig?

I enjoyed your notes on the Louvre. The last time I was there I was 
amused to see the huge crowd straining at the velvet rope around the 
Mona Lisa; while next to it, Leonardo's equally interesting ``Virgin

<p>
Are you familiar with American painter Thomas Cole of the Hudson 
River School. He was influenced by Poussin's classical paintings. 
There is a fabulous series of five paintings in the New York 
Historical Society's gallery called ``The Course of Empire" If you are 
ever in NY it might amuse you to see how many Ionic, Doric and 
Corinthian columns can be crammed into one painting. I had a full 
size copy of No 3 ``The Consummation of Empire" made for my dining 
room. Maybe you saw the retrospective at the Smithsonian in 1994?

<p>
<i>((I know I've seen some of Thomas Cole's work somewhere, though
I'm not sure I remember where.
It could have been the Smithsonian in 1994, as I go there quite a bit
on my frequent DC trips, more often back then when I was working on
Hillary Clinton's Health Care Reform Task Force in 1993 and 1994 than
now.))</i>

<p>
There is also in the Society's gallery, a picture of an early 
governor in drag, which he wore all the time saying, ``I represent 
Queen Ann, how else should I dress but as my sovereign does?"
No wonder you had to have a revolution. We got away from the Brits in 
slow increments, quite painlessly. What finished us off was the fall 
of Singapore, our bulwark, in 1942. Your boys had to come  and rescue 
us. We consider ourselves almost an extra state. We have sent all our

Just a quick acknowledgment that TAP-251 arrived today. You may publish this. 
Procedures have been changing at the Postal facility where I work in response 
to the death of two Postal workers to anthrax and the infection of several 
others.  Hopefully, this won't affect my vacation to Mexico starting this 
weekend. Eleven days in Mexico's Copper Canyon region. I have been working 
with a new Therapist-Counselor in adjusting to my post-surgery physical and

As far as the music section goes, I did indulge myself and buy the CD of the 
soundtrack for the movie FARINELLI. The main interest, of course, was the 
well done blending of two voices to produce a new sound. Nowadays we have no 
real idea what the Castrati sounded like, since much of their abilities and 
sounds came from over 15 years of rigorous training after the knife. Those 
training methods have been lost. How did they manage to achieve a vocal range 
of three and a half octaves? So the CD presented an interesting idea, 
something like a soprano on steroids. Even if nowhere near authentic in sound 
and story line, it represents an interesting experiment.

<i>``From Hell" - a movie</i>

<p>
This one is graphic.  Gore, sex, drugs, all in the context of 1880's 
Whitechapel complete with Jack the Ripper.  ``From Hell" started out as a 
graphic novel.  The adventures of Jack.  The movie rather turns the novel 
around and tells the story from the point of view of Inspector Abberline 
(Johnny Depp), a psychic opium addict who sees Jack's crimes while they are 
being commited.  Despite his psychic help, Abberline can't catch Jack.  There 
is a conspiracy of powerful people protecting the fiend.

<p>
Like the graphic novel, the movie is dark.  Shot mostly at night, in rain and 
shadow.  The mystery grows as the movie develops.  Quick cuts and unusual 
angles give much of the flavor of a graphic novel.

<p>
Good Job.  

<p>
<i>((I saw ``From Hell" on Friday night.  I hadn't noticed the ``graphic novel"
connection, but surely see it now that you mention it.  I actually had
higher expectations for the movie, partially because I love Johnny 
Depp (I even have liked his bad movies like ``Sleepy Hollow'') and his
acting style, so I was slightly disappointed.  But in retrospect
that was not the best attitude.  I don't mind gore, though Charlotte
was a bit taken aback at times.  And I think this actually had deeper
things to say that disquieted me somewhat, which is why I LOVED 
the ending.  What I didn't love was the OBVIOUS manipulation of
the identity of the one of the victims.  You could see it coming 
MILLIONS of miles away!!  Good that they didn't screw up the ``ending" too.
I liked the ending, even though it supposedly didn't ``test'' well.
Thanks for another review!))</i>

<p>
I didn't much care for Heather Graham's character at all.  She was way too 
clean and shiny for an `unfortunate' of the time and place.  You are right 
about the manipulation of the that victim.  If anything, the message of the 
movie was that there is corruption.

straining to produce that accent (not that bad but when one can ``see the
struggle" too much it was distracting) and was not one of the better
parts of the movie.  And you did get a sense that this was a 
``post X-Files" movie for people who like to see conspiracies, but
still I thought that aspect of things was part of what was disquieting
and NOT in far fetched ways.))</i>

<i>``K-Pax" - a movie</i>

<p>
Kevin Spacey plays ``Prot" (the `o' is long) a visitor from the planet K-Pax.  
K-Pax is about 1000 light years from earth.  It revolves around a binary star 
pair, neither of which is as bright as Sol.  When on earth he prefers to wear 
sunglasses, even indoors, except at night.  He appears in Grand Central 
Station just in time to get mixed up in a mugging.  The police profile him as 
a nut and turn him over to Bellevue, where he is drugged with Thorazine, to 
no seeming effect.

<p>
Since Bellevue can't figure him out and since he may be dangerous (anything 
you can't explain may be dangerous) he is turned over to a different 
psychiatric institute.  

<p>
Jeff Bridges (Dr. Mark Powell) draws the case.  He very much wants to heal 
``prot's" dementia.  

<p>
That's the start of the movie.

<p>
As the movie progresses we learn that Mark is as alienated from his family as 
Prot is from the world.  Rather, as Mark perceives Prot is from the world.  
Prot, in the meantime, integrates himself into the patient family and starts 
teaching the various patients how to heal themselves.

<p>
Mark takes Prot to meet a group of astro-physicists, in an attempt to get him 
to understand that he is not from a distant planet.  Prot shows the 
astro-physicists the orbit of his planet.  Thus explaining for them a 
puzzling perturbation they had mapped in his stars but didn't understand.  
When asked how he knew this he explained that on his planet, the planet's 
orbit was common knowledge.

<p>
At times funny, but not a comedy at all.  ``K-Pax" gave two excellent actors 
an interesting story to explore.  I liked it.

<i>``Bandits" ... a movie</i>

<p>
I have long been a Bruce Willis fan, ever since I saw him play a dirtbag role 
on ``Miami Vice".  He is one of the most versatile actors I know.  The same 
can be said for Billy Bob Thornton (except for the ``Miami Vice" part).  Throw 
in Cate Blanchett and you have a remarkably talented crew.  In ``Bandits" they 
proved that talent really does make for a superior product.

<p>
Willis plays ``Joe" who is impulsive and has anger management issues.  
Thornton plays ``Terry" who is intelligent, sensitive, and the world champion 
hypochondriac.  ``Terry" knows he is a hypochondriac, but he also knows that a 
hypochondriac experiences real symptoms even if the diseases are all in his 
head.  As far as he is concerned that makes him a dangerously ill 
individual.  The two of them have a dream, and rob banks to finance that 
dream.  Blanchett plays ``Kate" a housewife gone over the edge.  She hates her 
life to the point that being a hostage to bank robbers looks pretty good.

<p>
The story starts at the end, with ``Joe" and ``Terry" trapped in the bank that 
was to be their last big heist.  It is told in a flashback nearly documentary 
style intercut with scenes showing what really happened.

<p>
Not the best movie ever made but it was fun, the characters were great, and 
the story was more than satisfying.  A bit hard to believe perhaps, but 
totally satisfying all the same.

<i>((Yeah, I think Kate Blanchett is loads of fun to watch, but somehow
Charlotte didn't agree.... I don't know why?
In any case, it was interesting to me to see Billy Bob Thornton playing
that sort of character SOOO perfectly and Bruce Willis is just SOOO cool.
A fun movie!!
Some side commentary on celebrity and the way ordinary people react
to strange situations too.))</i>

<i>``The Glass House" - a movie</i>

<p>
Good actors, interesting characters, a bit weak in the plot.  Lots of well 
crafted sinister suspense, but no real surprises.  ``Terry Glass", the 
sociopath villain (notice that there are no villains that are not crazy now 
that Hollywood has discovered the sociopath concept) was well acted by 
Stellan Skarsgard.  He was glib, he was evil, and, he didn't even consider 
that anyone would ever question him.

<p>
Bruce Dern was a surprise for me.  I had him figured to be part of the evil 
plot.  Turns out he was just a clueless bystander.  A sort of reverse 
typecasting I suppose.

<p>
Leelee Sobieski was very good as ``ruby" the teenager who is being victemized 
and turns things around.  But the whole thing still needed a lot more story.

<p>

<i>((I want to see this since I am a huge Leelee Sobieski fan.
I think she will end up being her generation's Meryl Streep and I
don't make that comment lightly.
But Steve ALWAYS manages to see more movies than I do....))</i>

<p>
<i>The Musketeer" - a movie</i>

<p>
Based on the Dumas novel ``The Three Musketeers", ``The Musketeer" takes the 
young arrogant but naive D'Artagnan, and presents him as young arrogant and 
not at all naive.  The story spins out from D'Artagnan's double quest, part 
to become a King's Musketeer, like his father, and part to find and kill the 
man who murdered his parents.

<p>
Tim Roth plays a role that didn't occur to Dumas, a psychopathic killer with 
political power behind him.  He is the man D'Artagnan seeks.  As always, Tim 
Roth brings lots to the screen.  Febre is the cool cruel villain of nightmare.

<p>
Well plotted story, beautiful young people, cunning evil.  What more could 
you want?

<p>
How about a movie full of the most exciting swordplay ever screened.  Eat 
your heart out Errol Flynn.  Xin-Xin Xiong was the stunt designer, and he 
brought years of martial arts experience from Hong Kong to France, where he 
unfolded it to create some incredible gravity defying stunts in the midst of 
slashing and stabbing from all directions.  Brilliant.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Steve, Steflan of aol.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((Right on!
I infinitely preferred this movie to ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'', for
example, on the quality of these stunts.
The ``buzz'' on this movie was all bad and we almost didn't even go see it,
but I'm glad we did.
Totally different from the classic Lester directed movies of the 70's, but
worth it.
Rent this when it comes out on video!))</i>

<i>``Monsters Inc." - a movie</i>

<p>
I laughed, I cried...

<p>
Wonderful movie.  And to think when the monster came to visit me in the night 
as a child I thought he was the bad guy.  Come to think on it, he was the bad 
guy.  

<p>
Some of the monsters are bad guys, ``Randall" for instance.  Some of them are 
just doing their job, like ``Mike" and ``James".  

<p>
Little kids are scary to monsters. Yes, hard as it is to believe, little kids 
are extremely dangerous.  Every monster who steps out of the closet does so 
knowing that he (or she) might die.  All it takes is a single touch.  Little 
kids are toxic.  Unfortunately, little kid screams are what powers the 
monsters' world.  It's an extremely hazardous job, scaring little kids, but 
someone has to do it.

<p>
This is the story about what happens when one of them steps through the 
closet into the monster's world.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Steve, Steflan of aol.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((Yeah, and it really didn't feel like a kid's movie to me,
even though I guess it was rated G.
Lots of fun, good hissy bad guys, and the most hilarious ``audition''
set ever seen in a cartoon.
Speaking of not kid movies, it seems pretty clear that the Harry Potter
movie is going to blow the doors off any opening and any experience in
the history of cinema for box office.
I just hope they don't wimp out like the New York Times did and ``create
another category'' for Harry Potter.
Hey, I like it, what can I say....))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Most games in <i>TAP</i> are named after songs by the Mekons, the
greatest rock and roll band in the world..... in my humble opinion.
This game is named after the first song on <i>Honky Tonkin'</i> which I
think is Eric Ozog's favorite Mekons album (complete non sequitur)...
anyway, ``I Can't Find My Money'' leads off with a sort of country 
salsa beat and then the vocals have a rap quality to them.
Not the greatest song in the world, but their usual complex message.
``Keep on Hoppin'" is a great dance song on this album and is a great
highlight of live shows and that one I quote in my regular Mekons'
quote down below.
But this song seemed to speak to how ***I*** keep losing money on
the szine, you all get this game for free, enjoy it!!
Dan or ``Fool'' suggested that I call the game ``Please Check Your Facts
(Before Posting Nonsense to Usenet)'' but all of you are not 
rec.games.diplomacy users, so that wouldn't work.
Besides, I want to consider my insidious Mekons marketing.

<p>
2) Unfortunately, Guillaume Sapaly reported 
that his computer is ``bug stricken'' and that he is E-Mail-less at
the present time.
I hope he will report it fixed soon, but I thought it was safer
to start the game with my ready replacement, CW Phillips.
Having a player in France without E-Mail in his first postal game,
might not have worked.
I will have Guillaume first in line for my next game opening and
will continue to also send him the szine for free.

<p>
3) For the next <i>TAP</i> deadline, open press (broadcast in Judge parlance)
is cheerfully accepted.
See the house rules for <i>TAP</i> at
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/houserul.html

<p>
4) Please carefully check and fill in any additional contact information
that I don't have above.
The tendency for many players in <i>TAP</i> is to use all three media,
phone - E-Mail - letter, about equally, others focus toward one of
them more.
This is part of the fun of the longer deadlines, so please try 
one of the media that you aren't familiar with!

<p>
5) Ah, yes, and Mr. von Metzke, may we please have a Boardman Number 
for the game?

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SOME EXCERPTS FROM THE SONG AFTER WHICH THE GAME IS NAMED):
``People say I'm happy and I like a drink or two;
Suspended in the darkness, I weep like a child......
I sleep the sleep of faithlessness; 
Lying underneath your bed of nails;
Listening to your cries in the silence of the night;
As your body crashes down above my happy smilin' face;
Oh kind Policeman please take me to jail;
My crimes are as many as the lines on my face.....
I can't find my money;
Oh, no!  
I can't find my money!!''

Please vote on it with your Fall orders.

<p>
(BERLIN): The Kaiser wishes to announce that he has turned in tentative 
``No" or reasonable facsimiles of such votes to any DIAS concession 
through Fall of '09 and even further if Burgess accepts Pig Latin. 
More will be forthcoming if need be.
<i>((And I will reiterate that players are welcome to say anything
they like in the press and then do something else in voting.
Moreover, press is black, so anyone could be saying these things.))</i>

<p>
(GERMAN PRESS):  Here are my conditional votes regarding a DIAS:  
F 07: NEVER, W 07: NO, S:08 UH UH, Summer 08: NOPE, Fall 08: NO WAY, 
W 08: Nah, S09: Hell NO, Summer 09: Thumbs down,

<p>
(PETROVSKY [Broken Teeth &amp; Decaying Gums Press]):  Bjarne faced off 
against ``sore butt" Dwaynee once more.  Escape was near.  There it was, 
a crack in the flooring.  Bernie/Buddy/Bjare/Oaklyn sneered at the beer 
drinker for the last time, or so he thought, and dived down into the 
darkness beneath the floorboards.  Free at last, free at last!  Feeling 
around in the dark, the story of his own life, Buddy [let's see, is that 
my personality today ... yes!] listened with intent to see if Dwaynee 
and his bunch of herb growing, horse back riding, Aztec feather wearers, 
were following close behind [after all, how else can you get to be a 
sore butt unless you follow close behind?].  Bernie [reverse 
personality] then heard the bubbles bursting.  The foam from all that 
spilt beer [sour version of spilt milk] were seeping through all of 
those cracks in the floor boards, and, one by one, bursting.  The ``beer 
spit" from those bubbles splattered all over Bjare's facelessness and 
started making him drunker [an oxymoron for the other morons playing 
this game].  There were so many bubbles that the entire bar above began 
to float, further and further, farther and father, down the hillside, 
heading towards the foaming sea below.  Buddy tried to swim for it, but 
a nail snagged his jock strap and pulled Buddy along with the floating 
bar.  From sea to shining sea, from beer foam to sea foam.  Would Buddy 
ever see the end of ``sore butt"?

<p>
1) I am taking reservations for the Edward Teller game, which will
be the next NYEED 7x7 game in this series.
Since it was asked, I'll remind everyone that we will again be
playing the Black Hole Variant.
Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.
John Schultz, Paul Rauterberg, Karl Muller, Harry Andruschak, Lee Kendter, Jr., Jack McHugh, and Sandy Kenny are on board.
That's seven, but Harry has been resigning from games and I'm not sure if
he still wants to play.  
We'll try to start this one next time and I'll print the rules with the
game start.
This game is FREE!!!!

1) One more endgame statement, still more are welcome.
I really will get caught up on final stats next issue, come hell or high
water.... ;-)
Players should let me know what they want done with their NMR insurance,
default is that it goes to a few more issues of postal subs after we
wrap the game up.

Endgame Statement for England</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
I didn't get an end of statement for SGIH in on time.  Sorry about that. 
Yep, I agree with Goz, I blew it early on, didn't stab when I should 
have, and essentially gave him a win - which for some reason didn't 
happen.  It was a good game - no NMRs, nothing got personal, and 
everyone understood that a game is a game.  I got tired of reading about 
baseball in the press, but have no other complaints.  You did a great 
job GMing the game.  Thank you.

<p>
<i>((You're welcome, but I assume you didn't get tired of reading about
college basketball, right?? ;-)
Big East basketball looks to be VERY competitive this year, John Linehan
is going to be stupendous for Providence and they are deep, deep, deep.
Syracuse also looks very strong....))</i>

<p>
It is time for me to unsubscribe to <i>TAP</i> for awhile.  Due to some new 
responsibilities at work, I don't have the time I used to for Diplomacy 
and I'm not interested in a game start at this time.  I'll get back in 
touch if I find the time.  I used to do most of my communicating at work 
during lunch and that isn't possible for me on a regular basis anymore.

<p>
That said, a couple of last comments:  I just received the new New Order 
album - GET READY.  It is outstanding.  Maybe not up to the classic 
standard of ``Technique", but much better than ``Republic".  I have seen 
several critics rate it as the best album of the year so far. There is 
still hope for a North American tour next year and they are supposed to 
be coming out with an EP in collaboration with the Chemical Brothers.

<p>
I received my season tickets for SU basketball recently and then learned 
that Billy Elden has been kicked out of school for sexual assualt.  He 
was the prize of this year's freshmen class.  Now they don't have any 
depth at point guard.  I still think they will be good and contend for 
first place in their division.  I hate the size of the Big East for
basketball - it is out of control (SU doesn't play UCONN at home this 
year).  In any case it should be the same old same old for SU - 20 wins 
and a trip to the NCAAs.

<p>
Thanks again for your great szine.  I've enjoyed it.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
3) Rick and John start out tied, but there are two more placings left
to be claimed.
Since Square is a ``B rider'' he'll get 2 and Isaac Newton will get
1 as a ``C rider''.
Thus, John goes out slightly ahead, but neither of them have many
good cards left for their racers.
The regrouping should be VERY interesting.

soon as spring or within the coming months. What is the world's powers'
opinions?
          
<p>
(BERLIN to BRITAIN): Ignore Sean. Please.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG ``WELCOME HOME''): The Romulans as promised have
returned Spock and Mr. Chekov.
Mr. Chekov can't seem to wipe the smile off his face.
He looks good and has said he'll probably spend his
retirement years on Vulcan.
Spock looks a little frail and he has said he may never ever go home.
I had a conversation with Spock.  For the record:

<p>
Kirk: Welcome back!

<p>
Spock: Thank you sir!

<p>
Kirk: Congratulations on your diplomatic initiative!

<p>
Spock: Initiative?

<p>
Kirk: It has been assumed that your presence on Romulus inspired a 
pro-unification effort that led to the unraveling of the Romulan/Ferengi 
alliance, the Ferengi panic, and subsequent attack of Romulus.
Starfleet Command is recommending you for the Interstellar Nobel Prize.

<p>
Spock: I think not!

<p>
Kirk (puzzled): Why not?

<p>
Spock: Because nothing you said is true.
I spent all of my time locked up with Chekov.
I didn't even meet with my pro-unification allies 
until after I was released.

<p>
Kirk (even more puzzled): Do you have any idea why the Ferengi
betrayed the Romulans to join the Cardassians?

<p>
Spock: To put it in human terms, the Romulan check bounced.

<p>
Kirk: Maybe I should turn on my universal translator.

<p>
Spock: That won't be necessary, I'll explain.
The Ferengi market was always split as to the decision to merge
with Romulus.
The Romulans had to bribe a Ferengi top level executive
to seal the alliance.
The transfer was handled by a mid level Ferengi administrator
who is an expert Dabo Game gambler.
He had an arrangement with a Dabo girl (Ferengi prostitute)
to fix the numbers on the Dabo Game wheel.
When the administrator would receive the Romulan bribe money,
he would go to the casino and make a killing at the Dabo wheel
before he would transfer the bribe.
The casino authorities got suspicious and interrogated the girl.
She gave up the administrator, but was unaware of the 
Romulan connection.
The Ferengi casino had the Dabo wheel reset and the girl led
the administrator to lose the bribe money and all of his
subsequent winnings back to the casino.
When the Ferengi top level executive failed to receive his
monthly bribe, he took it as a prelude to a Romulan invasion
so he got together with the Cardassians to attack Romulans.
Why they never contacted the Federation on the verge of 
collapse is still a mystery.

<p>
Kirk (pausing in disappointment): So what you are saying, Spock,
is that the United Federation of Planets was saved from 
annihilation by a Dabo prostitute, a corrupt Ferengi administrator,
and a superparanoid Ferengi chief executive?

<p>
Spock: That is essentially correct!

<p>
Kirk: Spock, if it's all the same to you, I'm going to change
the log and go with the Vulcan/Romulan reunification story!

<p>
Spock: As you wish, Captain.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to BOOB): What are you doing rerunning old logs???

<p>
(BOOB to JIM-BOB): I don't know, are you saying this is an
old log??

<p>
(JIM-BOB to BOOB): Yesssss!!!!

<p>
(BOOB to JIM-BOB): OK, never mind.....

<p>
(Q to CAPTAIN KIRK): I'm sorry, I blocked your last transmission
but quite frankly your logs are putting me to sleep.....

<p>
(BOOB whispers to CAPTAIN KIRK): Don't worry, sir, I reclaimed it
from the dustbin....  zzzzzzzzz

<p>
(STARFLEET to THE ROMULAN ``HIGH'' COMMAND): Message received and decoded.
Commander Worf is nonresponsive.  I'll keep tryin'...

<p>
(BOOB to WORLD): Snuggle, snuffle, uh, wha'?  Oh yeah, how about this...

<p>
(KIRK CONTINUED): I have a question for you, Spock.
Since you were doing your research on American Baseball, can you tell me
why baseball, so popular in 2001, went out of business in 2033?

<p>
Spock: President George Steinbrenner!

<p>
Kirk: President George Steinbrenner?

<p>
Spock: He also owned the New York Yankees.

<p>
Kirk: I didn't know that.
Isn't he the President who contracted Alzheimer's disease while he
was in office?

<p>
Spock: Yes, elected in 2008, he followed the man generally considered
by historians to be America's greatest President, ``W'' Bush.
Steinbrenner was so emotionally erratic that when he contracted the
disease, hardly anyone noticed.

<p>
Kirk: How did he even get elected?

<p>
Spock: As the time, the American people felt that no terrorist would
dare attack New York or anywhere in the United States with Steinbrenner
at the helm.
At first his administration seemed normal enough but then the disease
took hold.
The first hint was when he hired former President and opposition party
leader, Bill Clinton, to be the White House Chief of Staff to help the new
President ``handle'' the White House interns, if you get my drift.
Steinbrenner then hired well known Moslem Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to be 
Ambassador to Israel.
He then hired then fired then re-hired then re-fired Secretary of State
Dan Quayle.
The move that finally led to the truth about his disease was when he
fired Quayle for a third time and the replaced him with Billy Martin.
<i>((And this was because Billy Martin was STILL dead???
By the way, the ``W'' idea so strains credulity that.... oh, never mind,
why don't you go on....))</i>
Steinbrenner then became the third President impeached and the first
voted out of office by the US Senate.
When he went back to baseball he still had enough clout to get Albert
Belle elected as baseball commissioner.
Belle so totally alienated baseball fans that by 2025 the World
Series wasn't even on national television.
To make matters worse, the Yankees won every World Series from 1998
to 2033.  
<i>((That prediction already is blown.... ;-)  Oh well...))</i>
By 2031, even the Yankee fans didn't care any more.

<p>
Kirk: That's an amazing story, Spock.

<p>
Spock: The truth is, as they say, Captain ``stranger than fiction.''

<p>
(BERLIN to THE UKRAINIAN MOB):  Your populace (military, that is) 
resembles that of the Star Trek episode, where the entire planet is 
covered with people.

<p>
(JEFF to WORLD): It was with great patriotism, spirit, and appropriateness
that our Congress got together to say a prayer and sing ``God Bless
America'' after the terrorist attack on Tuesday, 9-11-01.

<p>
While this was all together inspirational and nationalistically unifying,
it was also ironic.
This is the Government that stripped God out of our public schools over
a generation ago.

<p>
I don't think it would be a complete shock if God was to respond in a loud
clear voice with the phrase, ``Are you talkin' to me??!!''
It can be easily argued that the Oklahoma City bombing and the epidemic of
school shootings could have been avoided had the perpetrators been at a
young age taught about prayer, the Ten Commandments, and faith in a loving God.

<p>
The fight against Middle East terrorists is of course a different matter.
In the past our leaders were able to inspire us easily because the enemy
was visible.
The country used to sing patriotic songs like ``America the Beautiful''
and the WWI classic ``Over There''.
With the new war, we not only are not completely sure who to fight,
we probably need to hire someone to write a new song titled ``Over Where?''

<p>
Obviously a total victory is required for us to maintain our freedom.
It is important to note that a victory over a foreign power will not have much
value unless we win the spiritual way from within.
We need a victory right now.
We need total victory in the long run, but more importantly we need revival.
