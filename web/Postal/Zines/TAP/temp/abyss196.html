From ``Drink It Up'' off of Negativland's latest dizzying collage CD
of ``think about it'' pop culture that REALLY is called <i>Dispepsi</i>.
Order it from them as <i>Pissdepi</i> though as they are trying to avoid

<p><br><p><br>Harold Zarr wins the award for being the first player to FAX orders
to me.
I'm glad it was viewed by him as being useful.
I had meant to put a letter from Doug Beyerlein into last issue,
but it got misplaced in the production process (as a few of you
delicately pointed out).
As a bonus, I have a couple of letters from Doug in this issue!
This issue should be somewhat more timely than the last one
as well, double bonus!!

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada. 
You can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
The current game opening for Colonial Diplomacy will start
as soon as I get money from seven players since Nekayah has now ended.
For more on this, see below.
Also note that more results for the demo game 
are included.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

The message:

NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
Note that everything has been moved to the diplom.org site.
See David's letter below.
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the devel.diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to the present are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the 
pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP directory in compressed postscript format.
The gracious assistance of Kevin Roust is most appreciated
in keeping up this site.
The files begin ap131.ps.Z and go sequentially from there.
Since it's UNIX based, all of those upper and lower cases are important.
If anyone wants help from me on doing this, they only have to ask and I
can help you determine if you have access to FTP which stands for
File Transfer Protocol and can handle postscript files.
The Caltech site is at:

<p>
ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/WWW/

<p>
or check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch 
at its brand new address with all of
the information you would need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<p>
In addition, through Jamie McQuinn's portion of the Pouch, or directly
through:

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP/

<p>
you can access the mirror site to Caltech and get to the szine that way.

<p>
In a relatively NEW development, the szine also is available as a PDF file,
readable with Adobe Acrobat's free reader.
If you already have Adobe's reader on your computer, you can E-Mail me for
a copy.
I am still in test mode with this.... you pretty much have to print
the szine to look at it as it just won't clear up on the screen.
Any of you who have NOT E-Mailed me about this test can still do so.
After I test this for a bit, I will have TWO E-Mail subscription lists
so you can choose PDF file, TeX source file, or both at your leisure.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR SCOTT HANSON</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Scott Hanson and his German wife originally left the hobby 
completely (after winding down a bit before that) when they
went to live in Germany.
I have reason to believe they still live there.
Knowing Scott's wife's name will help you in your search, but
I'm going to withhold telling you until next issue (giving those
who know a brief head start).
Then I have a ``dead giveaway'' clue for issue 198 that was (when
all put together) what led me to find Scott.
As I said, though, I did not try to contact him.
I need a music letter for issue 200 from him for you to win!
Get him to tell us what music he's been listening to for the
last decade or so.
If you fail to complete this task (and I mean this), I'm folding
the szine.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Mike Mills or Garret Schenck
or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.
For Scott Hanson you need to get him to write me a MUSIC letter.      
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

This three-day event draws the best players from North America and
beyond for a multi-round Diplomacy tournament and other competitions. 
On Friday night, May 22, players congregate for the first Diplomacy
round and other events.  During the Saturday night round, Con
participants can enter the Variant Diplomacy tournament instead, for a
touch of variety.  Tournaments in other games such as Titan, Miniatures,
History of the World, Advanced Civilization, 1830 and RoboRally will
proceed throughout the weekend also.  The host convention, Dixiecon, was
the site of the 1990 World Diplomacy Championships and 1994 DipCon.
    
Features Include: Four Round Diplomacy Tournament;
Plaques and Other Prizes; Wargames, Rail Games, RoboRally and Miniatures;
Inexpensive Campus Housing; Experienced Convention Staff.

<p>
The Carolina Amateur Diplomats will again host World Dipcon in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina, in conjunction with the regional gaming convention
DixieCon.  World DipCon is the World Diplomacy Championships, a
tournament which rotates around the world.  DixieCon was the World
DipCon site in 1990, when the event drew the largest field of Diplomacy
players in North America since 1983.  It also hosted the North American
Championships in 1994.  This year's event promises to be another
outstanding Diplomacy tournament as participants from around the world
travel to Dixie for the chance to become the 1998 World Diplomacy
Champion.
	
Of course, World DipCon isn't just about playing Dip with the best 
players in the world.  It's also about meeting hobbyists for the first
time, seeing old friends, and partaking of the many side-events,
including past DixieCon favorites such as Titan, 1830, History of the
World, Miniatures, Diplomacy variants, and others, both in tournament
and open-gaming formats.
	
Below is a list of DixieCon/World DipCon/DipCon staff members, and the
functions they are likely to perform.  Early registrants will receive
future DipCon Newsletters as they are published, with information such
as tournament schedules, expected participants, scoring systems, travel
aids, and other news on the upcoming event.  Contact David Hood now to

<p><br><p><br><b>Stan Johnson (10/11/97)</b>

<p>
Jim, You mentioned having a letter from Doug Beyerlein in the last
issue, but I couldn't find it.
<i>((Corrected below...))</i>
I'd like to see Doug back in the Hobby.
I think it was a little silly to leave the Hobby due to a feud
he was not really a participant in.
<i>((I think everyone would admit that it affected the entire
Hobby atmosphere to such a degree that at least I can see how
Doug was making sense.))</i>
At the time, I thought the whole feud was silly and was very
surprised so many people took a load of bullshit to heart.

<p>

<center>Stan, 1254 E.&nbsp;Broadway Rd. #56, Mesa, AZ  85204</center><br>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Doug Beyerlein (Wed, 24 Sep 1997 21:28:16 -0500 (CDT))</b>

<p>
Jim,
<i>TAP</i> #194 arrived a week or so ago.  
I read Stan Johnson's note and your reply.  Your reply was
completely correct regarding my feeling about the feud.  
I am not interested in reliving any of those memories, 
but I thought that I should give some additional perspective on 
my feelings towards the Diplomacy hobby.  
So, if you permit me:

<p>
I grew up in the postal Diplomacy hobby: both figuratively and literally.  
I joined the postal hobby in September 1966 at the age of 16.  
I met my wife-to-be, Marie Cockrell, while playing in the
Diplomacy tournament at the 1974 DipCon in Chicago.  
We got married less than a year later.  
And I have many good friends as a result of the hobby.  
People like Walt Buchanan and John McCallum.

<p>
I got a lot from the hobby during the 20 years (1966-1986) I spent in it.
And I tried to give a lot back.  
I was the Boardman Number Custodian in the mid 70s and later I ran a zine, 
<i>EFGIART</i>, for orphaned games.  
I never charged a game or subscription fee to the players in these games.
<i>((A policy that I also use for the orphans that I run, an idea
I got from you.
The last three games in the back of the szine (Columbus Chill and 
Covington Cross [both from Melinda Holley], and Suffren Succotash
[from Garret Schenck]) are all orphans and most of those players
have been getting the szine for at least two years now on that deal.))</i>

<p>
I had a lot of hopes for the hobby.  In hindsight they were unrealistic 
hopes, but they were hopes nonetheless.  
I wanted to see Diplomacy go mainstream and be as well known as Monopoly,
Scrabble, and chess.  
The opportunity was there in 1976 when Avalon Hill bought Diplomacy 
from Games Research (GRI), but we didn't take advantage of it.  
John Moot, president of GRI, had been subsidizing <i>Diplomacy World</i> 
and the Boardman Numbers.  
Avalon Hill was willing to continue that arrangement if AH could deal 
with a single organization that would take responsibility for the
DipCons, DW, and the Boardman Numbers.  
(AH had never made a similar offer to any other AH gamer group.)  
The International Diplomacy Association (IDA), founded in 1972, 
was in position to provide the organizational skills and respectability 
to work with AH to promote the game of Diplomacy and the postal hobby.  
But we (and I take a share of the blame) didn't get our act together.  
Instead, the hobby reacted in its traditional anarchistic fashion 
and AH walked away from the table.
<i>((As someone who has long opposed such organizations for this
hobby, I note that this particular element of that story is new
to me, at least in the way you present it.
I'm not sure it changes my opinion completely, but it does make it
waver a bit.))</i>

<p>
I do not believe that all would have been peaches and cream if we 
would have cooperated with AH (I have been a member of too many 
organizations and clubs to believe in fairy tales).  
But I believe that the postal, email, and face-to-face hobby today 
would be bigger and stronger and better if we would have acted to 
achieve a common goal.
<i>((Quite frankly, I like the anarchic hobby style as a contrast
to the high pressure, high performance world that I work in.
The hobby is an immeasurable source of fun to me.
Nevertheless, I admit that some of that organization might have been 
helpful to the hobby and still might be helpful today.
On the other hand, the deep multi-level game that Diplomacy is,
with its inherent time consuming pace is not in line with the perceived
current societal pace.
Is there interest in resurrecting any portion of this discussion.
All the relevant parties are here
(David Kovar, Nick Fitzpatrick, and others from the E-Mail hobby
who've worked with Avalon Hill recently to get better exposure for
Diplomacy through the Judge system; as well as Conrad von Metzke,
Larry Peery and others who have the history in memory).
Food for thought, anyway.))</i>

<p>
The events of 1986 finally convinced me that the postal hobby would 
never grow up.  
But by 1986 I had grown up.  
I was no longer a wide-eyed 16 year old high school junior, 
but the 36 year old vice president of an engineering consulting firm.  
I decided it was time to move on with my life.  
I will always hold a tender spot in my heart for the Diplomacy hobby 
(which is why I am writing this letter). 
Unfortunately that spot will also hold the pain of what could have been.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION 
(WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>
Some relatively random ramblings from me this time....
warning to the unaware, I am indeed feeling extremely 
alliterative this issue and offer no apologies for it:

<p>
1) Melissa Ferrick - There is a record from her called 
<i>Melissa Ferrick +1</i> that is on the small label
Hidden Water Records, available for $8 plus $1.50 for shipping
and handling US ($4 - International), plus 7.75% tax in California.
Mail to Hidden Water, 1702-H Meridian Avenue, Suite #131, San Jose,
CA  95125; ATTN: orders.
Later this year it is supposed to come out on WAR records and be
available in stores.
I'm probably going to get this, one way or the other, since an old
review I found on the Internet of her earlier Atlantic work compared
her to Mary Karlzen and Mary's quirky songwriting is a mild 
strange pleasure.
Wandering around the Internet, I also was reminded that Melissa
made headlines around here for her ``last minute'' opening act
work for Morrissey at Great Woods about five years ago
that jump started her career.
Morrissey is someone who has (with purpose on my part) dropped 
totally off my radar screen.
This is interesting since early Smiths records were and still 
are highly favored around here.
Sharp-minded readers will recall that I panned <i>Meat is Murder</i>
with such boring excesses as ``That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore''
and ``Nowhere Fast'' which perfectly describe my reactions
to everything Morrissey has done since (wink).

<p>
2) Lots of FASCINATING latter half of the year releases have me
really thinking about the scattered definitions of music in the
current post-rock culture.
Although ``rock'' music still exists, I would assert that it is akin to
a dinosaur after the comet/meteor/whatever hit the Yucatan.
Things like the release of a new Rolling Stones record leave
me yawning; however, in no particular order, we also see a whole
slew of ska, loads of quirky women folk singer songwriters, post-punkers 
like Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello doing all sorts of thought provoking
stuff, blues/roots stuff from a dizzying array of influences,
``sound bite'' mixers like Negativland, sound collage makers
like Portishead and Delta Clutch and Stereolab, and bands like Chumbawamba 
(who knows how to classify them?) releasing records that have me reeling
(puns intended...).
On one hand, nearly all of this music appears to fit rather decisively
into the fast-paced scattered world we live in, thus it ``speaks''
the language of the moment.
To me, the way to tell is to try to listen to the music all by itself
with nothing at all going on otherwise.
Other than some of the women songwriters I am thinking of, much of
this music (and especially the sound collage makers like Portishead)
falls a bit flat.
I need to be careful here, because I don't mean flat in the sense of
boring - I cannot imagine more sinuous, slinky, pregnant music
than ``Glory Box'' presents - I mean flat in the sense of being
incomplete, needing another dimension (e.g. the ``fast-paced scattered
world'' that surrounds us) to come to full realization.
The question is whether the music speaks TO us without telling
us what to do.
Paul Everett (ex-Plan 9 way cool music) who is now lead singer
for Delta Clutch puts it this way: ``I can't sing about what you
should do, unless it's someone I know who did something to me.
Because we play music that's all about feel, it's never hitting
someone over the head.''
I am not being exceptionally clear here, because I'm not sure what all
this means to me yet, but I'm going to work it all out for my end of
the year, end of the <i>TAP</i> century 200th issue.
Watch for it.

<p>
3) This is about time to issue the ``call'' for music contributions for
Issue #200.
From this point on, I reserve the right to hold letters or portions of
letters for that issue.
It will appear toward the end of January after a six week or so hiatus.
I intend to have this set of submissions have two parts (submit your
thoughts on one or both, but NOT neither!): 

<p>
a) Your thoughts on what music of 1997 meant to you - possibly in
the form of top (whatever number) CDs, favorite/memorable concerts,
zapper singles that made you jump out of your chair, or whatever
form you like! - which can be a list, or it can have lots of 
discussion/comments.
For me this has been the most fascinating music year in some time,
what about for you?
Can't you at least give me ONE song that stood out to you?
Sure you can.

<p>
b) Your thoughts on how music has changed/progressed/declined over
the approximately 13 year history of this szine's focus on music
issues (choose a relevant time window of your own if you like -
that's the primary range I'll be looking at).
This could be a new or revaluation of a list of your top CD/records
of the decade/century or it could take a discussion format.
The main point is that it be YOUR story.
Your story does count (much as I realize that many of you don't
seem to think I believe that).
Originally, I was going to do a list (and I still may) but as the
above mini-essay makes clear I am now leaning to something more
verbal.

<p>
You can also combine the two questions to say something very short and simple.
I even want to hear from those of you who would
say something like this (for example): ``I grew up in the 70's listening
to Yes, Genesis, and Renaissance and you know what?
That's all I still like to listen to.
Well, except, Anthony Phillips has another great album out this year.''
Then I can ask: ``Great! Where can I find it??''
Give it a ride!
Now for something completely different, I asked Andy York if I could
reprint his column on the Science Fiction WorldCon that he wrote
for Per Westling to this audience.
He graciously said yes, thanks to Per as well!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Andy York (Sat, 4 Oct 1997 19:52:50 -0400 (EDT))</b>

<p>
Here's the WorldCon Report. It is in the format for my column in Per
Westling's <i>LEPANTO 4-EVER</i>.

<p>
<p><br>
<center><i>WAYwords #25  by W Andrew York</center><br></i>

<p>
WorldCon was held at the end of August here in San Antonio. This
was the first time I could attend a World Science Fiction
Convention, and I must say, I hope it isn't the last. I found it
met or exceeded all of my expectations; my only complaint being
that there was too much to do. Many times I had to skip an
interesting panel or reading to attend something else that
grabbed my attention.

<p>
The venue was well chosen. The Marriott hotel chain has two
hotels across the street from one another and the large Henry B
Gonzales Convention Center. This is where everything happened;
though some folks were housed in overflow hotels around the
downtown area (all within walking distance).

<p>
The hotels responded very well to the eccentricities of the
convention. They turned over freight elevators to the convention
to help shuttle people between party floors, reversed escalators
to ease the flow of people after major events and kept cafes open
after normal hours for those seeking a late night snack (as did
the nearby food court at the Rivercenter Mall).

<p>
All in all, I'm proud of the way San Antonio (where I lived)
responded to this convention. The only complaint I heard the
entire weekend was from some Brits (I assume from their accent).
They were complaining amongst themselves about how hot it was
outside as they moved between sessions compared to the air
conditioning inside the buildings. Having lived here for over a
decade, I'm quite used to going from 90 degree (37.8 Celsius) to
70 degree (21.1 Celsius) on a regular basis.

<p>
My WorldCon experience began when a friend, Jamie McQuinn, from
Ohio called and asked if he could stay the night before with me.
Of course, I had no problems with it and we met up after my class
ended on Wednesday. He'd went downtown and was able to register a
day early. We both looked over the program books and planned what
we hoped to do the next day. 

<p>
I took him for dinner to Jazz, a local Cajun restaurant. It seems
when Dip friends arrive in town, we end up eating there. The food
is excellent and plentiful. At least this time the ceiling didn't
come down (my previous visit was during a freak, heavy, rainstorm
that leaked through the roof - right on top of me and Richard
Weiss!).

<p>
On Thursday morning, we both headed downtown to pick up my
registration information. We arrived a bit after 9am
(registration opened at 9) and found it a bit unsettled. It was
obvious that they were still setting up and briefing workers on
their duties. Also, the lines for preregistration and on-site
registration were too close to one another and they became mixed
a bit. However, it was quickly sorted out and I claimed my badge
and program material. Very little was out on the ``freebies"
table, so we quickly left the registration room. 

<p>
As nothing was planned prior to noon, and my day's classes
started at 12:30, I bid goodbye to Jamie. He was going to check
into his hotel and then pick up some friends at the airport. I
headed to the university and spent the time until class trying to
decide what I was going to see and do for the next few days.

<p>
I was very much impressed with the programming material. The
convention committee had kept every preregistrant well informed
through a series of Progress Reports over the past three years.
They continued this excellent service with a very complete book
of information on WorldCons and the guests along with a smaller,
compact, pocket program listing the events and tourist
information. As I've mentioned already, there was so much going
on that I had to use a triage method to pick the things I wanted
to see the most. There was plenty of quality programming going on
all the time!!

<p>
After my classes were done, I drove straight downtown. I arrived
a bit after 4pm and decided to wander the dealer's room first. I
was pleasantly surprised to find a table for the Babylon 5 Fan
Club prominently placed. The two staffers were extremely
friendly, talkative and just plain pleasant to talk to. They were
selling t-shirts, caps and memberships to the fan club; as well
as showing blooper reels on a small television. Later in the
convention, they added the single episode CDs as merchandise and
a display of props from the show.

<p>
The rest of the dealers room was almost overwhelming. They had
people selling just about anything fantasy, science-fiction or
space related you could think of. Some of the publishing houses,
such as DelRey and White Wolf had tables (including autograph
sessions with their authors) and the Sci-Fi Channel had a large
booth. Others sold collector's items, used books, toys and even
the opportunity to send your DNA (a strand of hair) into space. 

<p>
A portion of the dealer's room included displays about past
WorldCons (and information on future bids), a filking area, a
very well designed message area and a brochures/handouts area.
This included promotional material from movie studios for
upcoming movies (posters, buttons, etc), sample newsletters and
zines and flyers for dozens of upcoming conventions. Scattered
about the area were exhibits of fan costuming and a dead ``bug"
from the upcoming <i>Starship Troopers</i> movie.

<p>
I didn't spend much time in the art show (a hall off of the main
dealer's area). However, what I did see was excellent. I wish I
had the skill to create the items that they did - and I wouldn't
mind the prices that they charged for some of it.

<p>
I went to my first session, titled ``Speculations: An Essential
Tool for Writers" and arrived a bit late. Unfortunately, I had
misunderstood the title. I had thought it would deal with using
speculation for writing; when in fact it was an information
session on the <i>Speculations</i> newsletter. I have ordered a
subscription, as the abbreviated sample issue looked quite
interesting. However, I think I would have enjoyed ``Recent
Archeological Spectaculars" much more.

<p>
I then wandered the dealer's room for a bit and then grabbed
dinner at the local Olive Garden. I wanted to make sure I made
the Opening Ceremony at 7pm. The room was packed to overflowing
and the start was delayed while they brought in more chairs.
After a short presentation, the majority of the presentation was
some ``local" talent demonstrating trick roping, gun twirling and
cowboy songs. The entertainers were very good, though I had
expected something more ``science fiction" related.

<p>
The Opening Ceremony was followed by a Meet the VIPs Event. It
was in a crowded room; however the VIPs were quite approachable.
I chatted for a few minutes with Mike Resnick before I ducked out
of the area and headed for Room Parties.

<p>
I stuck my head in a half dozen room parties, including bid
parties for CanCun and Chicago. One group, the NetSci-Fi, held
one; but it was more of a recruitment session for their website.
I spent most of my time in the ``FosFax" room party, talking with
Alex Slate and Tom Feller (folks I've known for years via mail
and EMail; but never met face-to-face).

<p>
Tired, I drove home for some sleep. I wanted to be back early the
next morning for the first full day of the convention. One thing,
though, that jumped out at me was the acceptance by everyone of
the handicapped. It seemed folks went out of their way to help
them out and include them in events. This is a big change from
our society at large where the handicapped are often ignored or
just tolerated. Quite a pleasant change.

<p>
The next morning, I arrived early and attended some sessions and
again wandered the Dealer's Room. Costuming was much more evident
today than on Thursday. I saw all sorts of Trek uniforms,
including a very well done Klingon, Medieval style clothing and
one person who was a convincing Indiana Jones - including his
trademark hat and whip.

<p>
One of the morning sessions I attended was on Military Science
Fiction. Some panelists expressed concern over how the graphic
violence of today's computer games (``Doom", et al) would
translate for future readers; as well as the lack of consequences
of for those violent actions. However, others hoped that
concentration on characterization would overcome this concern.

<p>
Another thread discussed what warfare was and how it should be
portrayed. Distinctions were drawn between organized warfare and
civil unrest. However, the general consensus was that war should
not be glorified; but portrayed truthfully - and that the
soldiers should be honored.

<p>
In the afternoon, I attended a session on Making Connections in
the Science Fiction Community. Mostly I went to the session to
meet another long time friend, Benoit Girard (of <i>Frozen Frog</i>
fame). I didn't pick up much new from the session; but quite
enjoyed the chance to chat with Benoit.

<p>
Another session was on the TechnoThriller genre. One of the
panelists, Austin Bey, felt that the first technothriller was
<i>MOBY DICK</i>. He defined the genre as a story based around current,
or near future, technology and the individuals using it. The
intimate knowledge shown of whaling in <i>MOBY DICK</i> fit the mold.
<i>((Did he mean the one with Richard Basehart (who was great!) and
Gregory Peck as Ahab (who stunk) that I remember seeing
that was made in the 1950's?
As I recall, Ray Bradbury had something to do with the screenwriting
for this one and I suspect that was driving Bey's assertion.
I'm afraid I disagree with that as a starting point.))</i>

<p>
However, others stated Eric Ambler wrote the first one.
Everyone seemed comfortable to at least say he wrote the first modern
technothriller.

<p>
Kevin Anderson, another panelist and one of the folks featured in
my last column, talked at some length on the topic. Most of his
work, in collaboration with Doug Beason, fits well into the
genre. He said the basis of technothriller is research, research,
research. You must know your topic to be able to write about it.

<p>
To emphasize this point, he related an interesting story about
his personal experience in writing. He has worked for many years
in secret government programs and has intimate knowledge of them.
He stated that as he read an unidentified novel by Tom Clancy, he
was shocked at the accurate knowledge Clancy displayed. When he
talked with his superiors about the passage, he was told that if
he had wrote the exact same passage, he could have been charged
with releasing government secrets. However, as Clancy was not
privy to the secrets, what he wrote based on solid research of
public information was allowed.
<i>((I hope you aren't disagreeing with the policy because
actually I agree with it.
There always is uncertainty about ``the facts'' and having
someone on the inside write something adds a factual certainty
that is completely different from a novelist making a well
informed judgment.))</i>

<p>
Later, I went to a session on Historical Mysteries (which I quite
enjoy). They talked about the difficulties of researching some
aspects of history and in weaving a tale that didn't violate
known historical facts. Of course, some literary license is taken 
with historical figures to fit the needs of the mysteries. The
whole underlying principle is that it could have happened. An
example of this is the historical figure meeting a character in
the book - the historical figure was in the right town
(historical fact); and could have met the character if they had
been real (literary license). 

<p>
The other main thread of the session was how to translate
historical attitudes and phrases into something palatable for
today's readers. For instance, a Roman would think nothing about
the existence of slavery - it was an accepted and integral part
of Roman life and to think of life without slaves would be
inconceivable. However, to soften the reality of slavery to
today's readers, the author has the character treat his slaves
humanly and is vocal against the mistreatment of them by others.

<p>
The last session for the day was a reading by David Gerrold. He
read an excerpt from the next book in the Chtorr series. Yes, he
is writing at least four more books for it! He then followed it
by a short section from the seventh book. Afterwards he
autographed items, for a $1 charity donation to Pediatric AIDS.
The only unfortunate incident was a person who had a cold. She
sat for almost twenty minutes loudly and continually blowing her
nose. Quite distracting and if I hadn't been half way across the
room, I would have suggested she step out of the room.

<p>
I headed home shortly thereafter as I was tired. No room parties
that night!!

<p>
On Saturday morning, I did a quick turn around the Dealer's Room
and then headed to the large Grand Ballroom. J Michael
Straczynski (JMS) was making a two-hour presentation on Babylon 5
at noon. When I arrived at 10:15a, already 300 or more folks were
staking out chairs. I found a good seat and settled in to read
while saving my spot.

<p>
At 11:00a another session started which showed movie trailers for
upcoming science fiction related movies. <i>Starship Troopers</i> looks
very good, as does <i>Lost in Space</i>. The new James Bond movie only
looks average, as does the American Werewolf one. Ten or more
other trailers were shown; but none really stood out (except for
<i>Gattica</i> - I must see that one!).

<p>
JMS arrived to a loud and noisy ovation from the filled ballroom.
The two-hour session practically flew by. He showed previews of
the upcoming two television movies, a bit of the new character
replacing Ivanova's position, and the season 4 blooper reel. He
also answered a number of questions from the audience and retold
the Jurasik/Katsulas revenge story.

<p>
I then stood in an autograph line (the first time in my life) and
had JMS sign my copy of his Scriptwriting book. He was very
pleasant to speak to and accepting of his fans. In fact, we were
originally told he would only sign two items per person; however
later he had the person come back through the line saying just ``a
reasonable number of items". He also was very accommodating to
those who wished a photograph or other special requests. I was
very much impressed.

<p>
Later that day I attended a session with a new producer (Marc
Zicree) of the Slider's television show. It had been dropped by
Fox and the Sci-Fi Channel picked it up. Everyone was glad of
that, and Zicree stated that they were going to make it a
``smarter" show - reversing the dumbing down that Fox did in the
last season to try and bring in viewers. Also, more science-
fiction elements are going to be added in.

<p>
In news, he stated Rhys-Davies has left the show completely.
Also, the Wade character will be missing from the early Sci-Fi
episodes. A new regular, played by Jerry O'Connell's real-life
brother, will be joining the cast as Quinn's brother from an
alternate non-technology time-line.

<p>
Lots of other spoilers and information was dropped, including
that Jerry O'Connell will be directing four episodes this year.
It is going to be filmed at Universal, with access to many of the
back lots and standing sets. Zicree is also seeking suggestions
and comments from the general public. He can be reached at
sliderutv of aol.com

<p>
I then went to dinner with Jamie McQuinn and one of his friends.
This was followed by the Hugo Awards. The winners were:

<p>
Novel: <i>BLUE MARS</i> by Kim Stanley Robinson
     
Novella: <i>Blood of the Dragon</i> by George R R Martin
     
Novelette: <i>Bicycle Repairman</i> by Bruce Sterling
     
Short Story: <i>The Soul Selects Her Own Society...</i> by Connie Willis

<p>
Non-Fiction: <i>TIME &amp; CHANCE</i> by L Sprague de Camp
     
Dramatic Presentation: ``Severed Dreams" (Babylon 5) 
     
Professional Editor: Gardner Dozois
     
Professional Artist: Bob Eggleton
     
Semiprozine: <i>LOCUS</i>
     
Fanzine: <i>MIMOSA</i>
     
Fan Writer: Dave Langford
     
Fan Artist: William Rotsler

<p>
The ceremony was well done and quite enjoyable. The only thing
that bothered me was the number of folks who left after certain
awards were presented. This was especially pronounced after the
Dramatic Presentation was given, quite a few people walked out
disturbing those who remained.

<p>
After the awards were over, I noted a CNN newscrew interviewing
some of the winners. Later, they made a tour of the room parties
and, from what I heard, some of the footage actually was aired
(though I didn't see any of it). I hung around with a small group
of people to congratulate JMS on his award.

<p>
I hit some more room parties, along with it seemed every other
person who was attending the convention. Many more folks in
costumes were wandering about, adding quite a bit of flavour to
the scene. I left late that night, quite satisfied with the
convention.

<p>
Unfortunately, I didn't feel well the next day and decided to
skip the rest of the convention (there was only a partial day on
Monday). Overall, I felt the convention was very well run and
enjoyable to attend. I only wish I could have cloned myself to
attend more sessions!!

<p>
If this peaks your interest, next year's WorldCon is in
Baltimore. The following year is in Australia and in Chicago for
2000. Start saving those pennies!!!

<p>
Jim,
Just received #195 and read Brad Wilson's letter.  The comment about the 
Uncle Bonsai CD instantly got my attention and sent me in search of my Uncle 
Bonsai audio tape, <i>Boys Want Sex in the Morning.</i>

<p>
Marie and I have long been Uncle Bonsai fans.  We saw the trio (Andrew 
Ratshin, Arni Adler, and Ashley Kristen) perform several times in the 
Seattle area in the late '80s.  At one of their shows we bought <i>Boys Want
Sex in the Morning</i> and enjoyed it immensely.  The tape contains 14 of their 
songs and was recorded live at the Backstage in Seattle in 1986 by Freckle 
Records (Pioneer Square Box 4005, Seattle, WA 98104).  The tape includes 
crowd favorites ``Fat Boys" and ``Boys Want Sex in the Morning" plus 
``Cheerleaders on Drugs" and many more.
<i>((Just so people don't get the wrong idea, Uncle Bonsai not only
did hilarious songs in those beautiful trademarked soprano harmonies of
theirs (I ordinarily don't find really high voices this attractive!).
They also did some really poignant tearjerkers.
``Charlie and Me'' ends <b>The Inessential Uncle Bonsai</b> CD that I own
and digging THAT out again has the loneliness and missed opportunities
in that song bringing tears to these eyes.
I don't know if you know that one.
Also, as compared to my comment to Brad last time, I was playing the CD
on my little portable while typing stuff for the szine.
Taking the CD back downstairs to the main stereo helped it sound much better!
I do recommend it more highly than I might have indicated.))</i>

<p>
We lost track of Uncle Bonsai in the early (mid?) 90s (time flies way too 
fast).  For some vague reason I thought that the trio broke up, but I really 
don't know their fate.

<p>
What we really liked about their songs was the total originality of the 
lyrics.  A nice extra with the tape is the printed version of the lyrics 
that comes with it.  It is great for Marie, who likes to sing along as we 
listen to the tape while driving on the freeway.
<i>((Yes, that is helpful... now you mean she reads the lyrics (in very
small print) from the tape box while driving?
Help..... I'm glad I'm driving Freeways 3000 miles away.
But I'm doing it on 128, one of the worst Freeways in America.))</i>

<p>
Anyway, Brad's comments got me to dig the tape out of the closet and put it 
back in the car where it belongs.  Thank you.
<i>((You're welcome.))</i>

<p>
Now are there any Igor Cowboy Jazz Band fans out there?  Swamp Mama Johnson 
fans?  Guitar Slim?

<p>

<center>Doug Beyerlein, atc-hspf of ix.netcom.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Not me, but check out the audience.
Comments?
And yes, unfortunately Uncle Bonsai broke up around 1991 or 1992.  Ratshin is
still a full time musician, but the women are retired.  Thanks for that 
letter too!))</i>

Jim,
After sending my message yesterday evening I did a search on Yahoo for Uncle 
Bonsai.  The official Uncle Bonsai web page is maintained by Yellow Tail 
Records.  They have info on the two Uncle Bonsai CDs that are available.  
You can also read the lyrics of the songs on their web site.  Anyway, 
according to Yellow Tail, Uncle Bonsai disbanded in '89.

<p>
Brief note - taking a break from my latest mad project (rescuing an
orphan Railway Rivals 'zine in England - last published Christmas 96,
with reports on 54 games!!!).  So I turned on the radio and was treated
to the funniest thing I've heard in a long time.  (We're speaking
unintentionally funny, that is.)  Actually, you gotta give 'em credit,
but they picked the wrong place to try their talents....
     
The orchestra was the Philharmonic Symphony of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. 
Didn't catch the conductor's name, doesn't matter anyway.  And they were
playing, of all things, the ``William Tell" Overture.  
     
The first section wasn't all that terrible - nice 'cello tone, not
much legato but at least he/she had the right idea.  
<i>((There's always that.
I like the realization that ``cello'' is a shortening of violoncello,
we so often forget....))</i>
But from then on -
Rossini meets Boris Godunov!  The storm was the Siege of Moscow.  The
pastorale featured an English horn down in the bowels of some mausoleum,
and ``The Volga Boatman" jumped to mind.  All the lovely string work,
chopped, clipped,. strident, and your choice of (a) loud or (b) louder. 
And then came the trumpet call - trouble city!  The tone was rancid, the
tonguing was barely passable, and then at the end of the fanfare where
the timpani joins in, we have no idea what happened with the trumpeter
because the drummer whacked him off the stage.  
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork...))</i>
At which point the gallop
takes off - across the steppes - with exactly one level of volume (loud),
all the notes identical in timbre, every phrase abrupted because nobody
has learned to ease off a note, they just pick up their bows and start
something else.  
     
And then we finally get to those wonderful trombone passages toward
the end, the sort of thing Rossini tossed in all kinds of places that
always make a hit.  Well...er...have you ever stuck a soda straw into a
glass of Coke and blown into it, to listen to the gurgle?  So what you
apparently do in Plovdiv is, first you fill your trombone with Coke....

<p>
I mean, I know it isn't fair to make fun of the inept if they're
honestly trying, but good grief!  There has GOT to be other repertory,
even famous repertory, that they could work with - not something like
this where every little flaw stands out like a glowing neon light.  They
truly sound as if they're getting really good with those instruments now,
so maybe it's time to learn what the word ``music" means....

<p>
Oh by the way.  I'm not going to buy it.  I don't know the label, or
the rest of the contents, and I'm not much concerned to find out.  
<i>((I'm not surprised, it sounds like it was a ``once in a
lifetime'' experience!))</i>

<p>
But - one should hear something like this every once in a while,
just to understand that, really and truly, some things ought never to
happen.  Ever.  
<i>((Yes, otherwise, ``relativists'' would have us abandon all
hope, ye who enter here....))</i>
 
Somehow I felt like sharing this....

<p>

<p>
Jim,
Just read through <i>TAP</i>#195.  I always enjoy the Music Section, even if 
I don't comment often.  However, I discovered a new group this last 
weekend that I wanted share with your readers.

<p>
I was at ConClave, a science fiction convention in Lansing, Michigan. 
Many cons have a filk music program track that I usually ignore, but 
I was wandering down a hallway and heard some music.  My first 
thought was, ``Do the Barenaked Ladies have a new album out?"  When I 
got to the room, I found a three piece band playing some great music. 

<p>
Ookla the Mok is from the Buffalo area, and seem to have garnered a 
following among SF fans (some of their songs have SF themes).  The 
concert was great fun.  They remind me of several other bands that I 
have been enjoying lately; The Barenaked Ladies, Moxie Fruvus and 
They Might Be Giants.  There is lots of energy and a sense of humor 
in their music.  I bought two of their CDs, one to send to a friend 
(I was going to just tape it for him, but these guys are still 
``starving artists" so I thought it better to support them).

<p>
They have a web page with song samples:

<p>
http://www.infinet.com/&#126;scoteder/otmfan/

<p>
and their CD is available directly from the band for $12 (+$1 for 
S/H) 

<p>
Rand Bellavia, Ookla the Mok, P.O. Box 274, North Tonawanda, NY 14120-0274

<p>
I have no financial stake in this band or their CDs.  I just really 
enjoyed them and think they deserve some attention.
<i>((I have heard the band's name before (you don't forget
one like that), but haven't heard the music.
I'll check it out too.
Thanks for the tip!))</i>

<p>
On another topic, would you, or one of your readers please educate 
me.  I have seen several references in <i>TAP</i> lately about SKA music.  
I'm not sure I know what it is.  I am sure I have heard it and 
enjoyed it, but never knew it by its label.  I'm under the impression 
it has its roots in reggae or rap but that's about all I know.  Who 
are some of the most prominent SKA groups and their songs?  If I get 
some examples I might get a clearer picture.
<i>((I've been talking about the most prominent ska groups pretty
much right along if you've been following the szine.
I don't really want to write a big long thing about ska since I'm
waiting to see what Brad Wilson writes about it.
Fundamentally, ska operates off of an emphasis on beats one and
three of a four beat measure that makes it sound more bouncy
than standard rock music which ``sits back'' with beat two and
four emphasis.
The legend is that the original ska bands were listening to rock
on bad transistor radios and thought that the strong beats were
one and three.
This SHOULD make big band lovers key right in to ska since most
of the big band era songs were also done with one/three beat
emphasis.
I've long been thinking that ska is the way to bridge the
generations in all sorts of culture - from religious music
to wedding dance bands - if it happens, remember that you
heard it here first.))</i>
 
I know you are not a big Yes fan, but I am excited by the fact that 
there are supposed to be two new Yes albums coming out before the end 
of the year.  One contains material recorded before Wakeman left the 
band, yet again, and the other has their new lineup, with a 
keyboardist I haven't heard of before.  
<i>((You should not infer from the fact that I prefer certain
Yes songs to others and certain line-ups to others that I am not
a big Yes fan.
I love the Buggles as the Buggles, not as a patch to Yes.
I can't abide ``Siberian Khatru'' but swoon over ``And You And I''
and ``Close to the Edge''.
<i>Drama</i> has none, but <i>Fragile</i> isn't.
Rick Wakeman is a nutty strange person, but he is the only keyboardist
worth listening to with Yes.
Bill Bruford is an interesting drummer but Alan White is merely OK.))</i>

<p>
There, I did my duty.  It's always a good idea to send an occasional 
LOC just to keep on the good side of the zine publisher.
<i>((Yeah, I don't do my part, do I.))</i>

Jim, ta for the <i>((s))</i>zine.
Have I sent you a letter recently????
<i>((No.))</i>
The <i>((s))</i>zine is becoming to look so English, isn't it??
<i>((Perhaps, but if you prefer to pronounce the word szine
with the hard ``y'' sound I'd be really surprised.
Spell it right, or meet the consequences!))</i>
Press for Barno, oh who or what is Barno??
<i>((You must be joshing!
Mike Barno is merely the most famous employee of the evil corporation
that has the concession for Yellowstone National Park services!!!
He lives among mountains you can merely dream about.))</i>
Well, the highest mountain in the UK is Ben Nevis in Scotland
which is 1,344 metres (between 4,000 and 4,500 feet).
Britain is a very small country.
However, it's absolutely packed with stuff which is where its charm
lays.
If you want Geographical splendour you have to go elsewhere.

<p>

<p>
<i>((I'm not sure I agree, but I haven't really seen enough of
Britain to be definitive.
Peaks aren't everything.))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>It's time to at least think about another game opening.
What is really attractive to me is to run Vincent Mous' Modern
Diplomacy ten player variant.
There are about 50 supply centers and it is set across a map 
slightly more expansive than the original's European map.
This game is very popular on the Judges and has just been written
about by Chris Warren in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83.
If I get more interest, I'll print the rules and officially
announce a game opening.
Currently, Eric Ozog, Brad Wilson, 
and Harry Andruschak have expressed interest.
If not, I'll wait until another regular game or two ends before
starting another regular Diplomacy game.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny,
John Schultz, and Harry Andruschak are signed up.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Otherwise Conrad is now the new editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117.

<i>Game Notes (firmly orbiting in the tropopause):</i>

<p>
1) Thanks to Lee Kendter, Jr.&nbsp;for the Round #7 Miller Number
1997Jrn39. 
For Round #7 (our FINAL ROUND!!!) Austria is Randy Ellis, 
England is Jeff Ellis, France is John Schultz,
Germany is Mike Barno, Italy is Luke Dwyer, Russia is Stu Lancaster,
and Turkey is Harry Andruschak.

<p>
2) For the rest of the game, if Jeff doesn't submit orders, his units
will hold and his nukes will go unfired.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SKYWALKER-BOARD): I was expecting to get destroyed.
You guys were actually quite kind.
I fear that won't last into the last round.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): <i>TAP</i>-195 arrived Saturday, 4 October.
Which just happens to be my 53rd birthday AND the 40th Anniversary
of the launch of SPUTNIK ONE.
<i>((I turned 40 only a few days before that, on the 29th of September.
Yes, they waited until I was safely home out of the hospital
before they launched it.
Happy birthday!))</i>
This leaves only 7 days until the deadline.
Which explains why I am not putting in
much press this time around... lack of time.

<p>
(SKYWALKER-ANDRUSCHAK): I don't know about Scooby-Doo, but ever
since the X-Files moved to Sunday,
I have not watched a single episode.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): In a last-ditch effort to keep Jeff Ellis in the
game, I sent him a postcard, pre-addressed to you, with some neutral
moves on it.
All he would have had to do is sign it and drop it in a mailbox.
That he could not even be bothered to do that minimal effort
indicates something.
<i>((Yes, Jeff's phone also has been disconnected.
I think Jeff is worrying about more important things.
I wish him well!))</i>

<p>
(SKYWALKER-BOOB): True, you do separate the seasons, but, it
is hard to conduct negotiations when you are waiting to see
builds from the Winter season.
Nonetheless, it is not a major problem, but rather a topic
for future consideration.
<i>((This issue will go out somewhat more speedily from my end.
From where I sit, 90 percent of the time most substantial 
negotiation can go on without waiting for the builds or retreats.
Even more obviously, this game doesn't even have that constraint.
Note right up there that November 22nd is the next nuke deadline.
Negotiate about it now.
You know exactly the situation (well, most of it anyway....).))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): I have received <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83, and must
admit that ``Modern Diplomacy'' variant looks interesting.
But I am wondering about the deadlines.
See, I have a three week vacation to Antarctica 7-30 November, 
a 2 week vacation next February to see the total solar eclipse,
a 3 week vacation to Turkey in November 1998, plus whatever schools
the Post Office may decide to send me to in Norman, Oklahoma.
How flexible would you be about delays in seasons?
Not only for me but for other players who might need them?
Obviously, I am happier with a game played well than a game played fast.

<p>
(GM-EVERYONE, INCLUDING HARRY): I'm always willing to listen to the
players and be flexible, as long as there is general agreement
on what to do.
With things like this, asking in advance is much better than something
at the last minute.
Your foresight is commendable.
My current suspicion is that the game will not start before February.
It may not even start at all if there is low interest.
I would say, go ahead and sign up and we'll work something out for you
if you want to play.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BRAD WILSON): One of the worst aspects of the David
Helfgott hype, as far as my opinion goes, is the cutesy-wutesy
phrase ``Rach's Third''.
Really, the composer deserves better.
If nothing else, he also wrote a Symphony #3 that needs to be
played more often than it actually is.
<i>((His Elegiac Piano Trios (written on the occasion of the
death of Tchaikovsky) also are wonderful.
I have a treasured recording of those by the Beaux Arts Trio.
Technically, there actually is only one Trio and the other one
is a ``test version'' in a different key.
Still extremely sensitive music that I wouldn't want Helfgott
to touch.... well, I don't care what he does, but I wouldn't
want to hear it.))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): To hear Sergei Rachmaninoff's Concerto #3 in
D Minor for Piano and Orchestra properly done, track down any recording
by Vladimir Horowitz of this work.
He did one with Fritz Reiner and the RCA Victor Orchestra, and another
with Eugene Ormandy and the New York Philharmonic.
There may be others.
This guy did it correctly.

(SKYWALKER-BOARD): This has turned into a rather good game

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Dick Martin, and Vince Lutterbie
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is presently
missing, so I am running low on standbys here...).
Someone find Mike Mills!!
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!
Although press in this szine is generally black, I will make the
exception here that I will say who has NPRed and is ``at risk''
for being dropped. 
I screwed up my accounting for this last time.
So this turn I start over.
This season, we are missing press only from England and Italy.
Michael and Simon are on the bubble for Summer. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY-BOOB): Since I got no credit (nor, apparently, respect) for
my press last time, if I don't send any this time do I get recognition?
<i>((Very funny.... yeah, I screwed up.
If you guys sent any REAL press instead of this ``place saving''
stuff, I'd get more excited.
At least Doug has an excuse.... he's been sick...))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY - ALL): Excuse my lack of press this time around - I have 
the flu and just finished up my latest <i>Maniac's Paradise</i>, 
so I need a long rest.

<p>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY): I may be down, but I'm not out.
If you stick your hand out too far, too fast, you'll pull
back a bloody stump.

<p>
(RUSSIA-TURKEY): Hello, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): I wonder if he'll help you find your own troops
while he's doing that???

<p>
(PARIS to ISTANBUL(WE DON'T RECOGNIZE CONSTANTINOPLE)):  Ignorant fool:
must I explain my every move?  I went to Rome last Spring because there
was no place else for F Tyn to go.  I gambled that you would wisely for-
sake supporting Italy back into Rome, and grab Naples for yourself.  So
I missed my bet:  does that advance you a centimeter?

<p>
(RUSSIA-FRANCE): The Anglo-German juggernaut is going to be coming
down on you next.

<p>
(A FROG, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE IMMENSITY [Pt.14]):  I voiced my 
multi-farious worries about Germany to It:  ``...and now I have to agonize
myself over whether the Hun plans to support himself into Burgundy?  
How I suffer!"
     
``Poor baby.  You can cover your dots in the Fall."
    
``Yeah," I whined, ``but what if EG join T vs. me?  What are my
chances then?"

<p>
``Who said it?  Voltaire?  `Dieu est toujours pours les gros
battaillons.'  I've met the pompous fool on numerous occasions, and
reputations are backed by fact!"
     
``Voltaire's?"  I marvelled.
    
``No, don't be ridiculous."  It scoffed.  ``I refer to the Other
Guy."

<p>
``Oh, my!"  I sneered.  ``And how did the case of Custer and Sitting
Bull serve to support your assertion?"
     
It laughed.  ``We were out bowling in this frontier cow town called
Milwaukee.  Even the Other Guy gets distracted once in a while."

<p>
I sneered.  ``Didn't you guys ever play something like tennis?  
You'd have gotten more exercise, anyway!"
     
It replied, defensively, that It's ``...game would have been
truncated.  Don't forget," It reminded me, ``I told the Other Guy
that I would not serve. Non serviam."
     
Now I laughed.  ``You should have learned long ago:  never say
something that you're not willing to take back if circumstances change!
It almost states that, outright, in the Diplomacy rulebook."

I've begun my write-up on Ghods too, but you won't see it for a long
time since it won't appear until 1997 KT ends. 
Then again, 1997 KT could be sailing into the Endgame pretty soon.
Anyone want to take
odds on whether I will finish my article before Mark finishes his
on 1994 KF?  I'm still waiting to discover whether my key suppositions
were correct that ultimately determined the outcome of the game.
Come on, Mark....

<p><br><p><br><i>Selected Broadcast Press (1911):</i>

<p>
(edi of mgames.com as AUSTRIA):
Well it looks like there may be a three way draw here.
Now the issue that I have always wondered at in the play is that was it
really worth that much to go from a 4 way to a 3 way?   I still hold to the
old old school of either you win or there is another result.  This may be
also why I am a better ally in that if there is no victory I really value
the alliance over some marginalization of a loss.

<p>
(GENTLE KING JAMIE to BUCKINGHAM PALACE WAITER): Bring me a large dish of
vengeance.

<p>
(WAITER): I'm afraid the vengeance is rather cold, Sire.

<p>
(GKJ, HAPPILY):	Bring it on with all speed, then!
(and a glass of bordeaux, please, to toast those whose sharp blades
slaughtered the meat....)

<p>
(desper of math.rutgers.edu as OBSERVER):
So Jamie worms his way into yet another draw, just like most of the
Hall9* games.  Good show, Gentle King!
Looks like Pitt should have let Hohn win.
Rick

<p>
(hohncho of kaiwan.com as TURKEY): That's what I think too. ;)

Gratitude, too.  Justice naturally
derives from prudent concern with self-preservation; that means, from
the egoism of the consideration: `Why should I harm myself uselessly
and perhaps not attain my goal anyway?'

<p>
``So much on the <i>origin</i> of justice.
In accordance with their intellectual habits, men have <i>forgotten</i>
the original purpose of so-called just, fair actions, and for millenia
children have been taught to admire and emulate such actions.
Hence it has gradually come to appear as if a just action were unegoistic;
but the high esteem for it depends on this appearance, and this esteem,
moreover, continues to grow all the time, like all esteem; for whatever
is highly esteemed becomes the object of striving, emulation, and
multiplication, coupled with many sacrifices, and grows further because
the value of the effort and the zeal is added by every individual to
the value of the thing he esteems.''
Part of Aphorism 92 of <i>Human, All-Too-Human</i>; which is a precursor
to the quote I used last issue from <i>On the Genealogy of Morals</i>.
This quote I've used here is preceded by an earlier version of
precisely the same quote, so this is a follow-on of the same thought.
Playing Diplomacy also is a fundamentally egoistic action in this way,
I believe.

<p>
(MOSCOW to WORLD): Since Mike has no interest in a solo win and there is no
point in them changing sides, since they both tell me they want a two-way. 
There is no reason not to end this.  Nothing personal to Hank and Jonas, but I
am moving to reduce the number of people who must remember to vote for the
draw.  I have enjoyed this game and look forward to the next.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Uhhhh, I screwed up Richard Weiss' E-Mail address. What is
up there now is correct.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FRA-GER): Do not confuse my silence with danger.
My work load at the college this semester is the equivalent of 
teaching eight three-credit courses.
Given that a significant percentage of my work is in industry
doing consulting, I have almost no homelife either!
So it is not surprising that I send very few letters.
I will continue to hold in place and prevent anyone from moving
into the Atlantic.
I have sealed up the stalemate line, and will hold forever.
I still think this game is a waste of time, but hey, who am
I to complain?
I will move anyway you need in order to support your advance.
Just let me know what you want me to do, and I will do it.

<p>
(TURKEY-GER):  Try the correct e-dress next time you get connected. 
<font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
>rcw of netpci.com<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>  
Maybe you can figure out which side is East and which side is West, 
dyslexic YNAMREG.  
	
(TUR-YNAM): Send fleets over to ``help" France.  Hmmm, where have I heard
that before.  Oh yeah, Barno told me that before he stabbed me.  And oh
yeah, Dip Players who don't get to pass their genes on in the Dip Board
because they've been demolished by their ``friends" hear that from the
progenitors  (in little letters and words, that means those who are
Darwinianly successful).   
<i>((Huh??))</i> 

<p>
(TUR-FRA):  Hear that, he wants to help.   
Gee, I'd like to help you too, how about a fleet in NAO?
	
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> MIKE BARNO): Are you the Mike I used to play
DIP with in college?
Oh, give me a break.
The closest that I have got to the east coast, was Sharpsburg,
MD, for one week in 1993.
If we ever do meet we'd have a good time, and be life long friends.
I;m a wonderful ally and always do exactly what I say that I'll do.
Everyone just loves me.
I respect you (I wish that I had to say that to more girls).
I had no idea that you took standby spots.
I'm most concerned with having fun, and never look at the standings;
I also like to play for a win by the fewest players as possible.
I was just trying to figure out who was writing your press, in our game.
I was beginning to wonder if Jim-Bob had made up the press himself
and attached your name to it.
By the way, the last 6-8 game years have been screwed up by the 
unusual alliance of Turkey and Austria.
One of the poorest possible in this game.
I just couldn't ever figure out how to shake things loose.
Oh, by the way, do you still have as much faith in Richard after
that beer can off the head incident that I read about in the newspaper?
Richard did win the Darwin Award, so he must have something on the ball.
And, to give Richard credit he didn't create the Turkey/Austria
alliance, he was a standby.
If you don't like my press to you, you shouldn't put press in our game.
If you do, I may answer, just for the fun of it.
<i>((I assure everyone involved that we're all in it for the fun of it.
It's OK, but if we want to escalate this anywhere, I remind you of the
house rule that you must abuse the GM at least as much as you abuse
any other player.))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> JIM): Is there a 666 Smith Street address?
And, if so, how do you feel living next door?
And, who lives there?

<p>
(JIM-BOB to CHARLES): We do.
I've been through this one before, but now we have the 666 number on
the house as well, so this is a good time to bring it up again.
Our house is in a line of double/triple deckers built as mill housing
in the early years of this century.
Providence actually reached its population maximum around 1920
when it had nearly twice as many people as it does today.
Our house is the last one in the line, probably built by the
developer for himself (though I have not researched this in any way)
so it has higher ceilings and some neat architectural details.
Nothing really fancy, but it's why we bought the house.
Anyway, the plats were all made for the standard double/triple
decker allocation for this period in Providence
of two numbers per building (next door is
660/662, next to that is 656/658 etc.).
Thus, our plat is specified as 664/666 in the town records.
Theoretically, this allows us to choose which number to use.
The previous owners apparently were much more bothered by
the 666 number than we were and tried to shift everything
over to 664.
The town property tax records and the telephone company 
still have us as 666.
For purposes of our property liability insurance, as a result,
they have demanded that we go by 666 or they won't insure us - which
obviously bothers the bank who lent us the money.
I'm sure all of this is quite fascinating, but anyway, a couple of
weeks ago, I put a 666 on the house as well, so we won't get mail
returned on us or something that will cause us more of a problem
with the insurance company.
As far as all of you are concerned, we will still be going by
664, so don't change the address you use to send us mail.
Funny you should mention it when you did.
