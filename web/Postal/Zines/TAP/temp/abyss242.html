think he is giving it away,'' found on the Internet, not sure who
said it, do any of you know???

<p>
<p><br><p><br>A little illness and a little business travel have contributed to being
a week late again.  
As usual, deadlines have been pushed back a week to compensate.
We also have said goodbye for the moment to Scott Munson, who is
traveling in unknown parts, and has resigned all his positions in
the szine.
I know I am hoping and praying for him to find what he is looking for,
as I think part of what he needs to find is to figure out what he is seeking (if
that makes any sense).
I will publish Scott's entire note up here so everyone sees it:

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Scott Munson (postmarked 05 Feb, 2001 Eugene, OR)</b>

<p>
Jim, I'm sorry to say that I must resign my positions.
Life has gotten a bit grim.
I apologize for screwing up so badly, but I'm sure some folks will
enjoy taking over, seeing as I'm leaving pretty strong positions.
Take care, and I hope someday to see <i>TAP</i> again.
I thoroughly enjoyed playing Diplomacy in your publication.
The people there are all around enjoyable to game with.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Sincerely, Scott Munson</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
One last press please -

<p>
(TO ALL): My apologies, folk.
May you all fare well.
To my allies, I'm sorry.
To my enemies, you're lucky.
And to all, have fun.

<p>
<i>((Thanks, Scott, he isn't seeing even this issue and I don't think he saw the
last one, but bye anyway.
I hope anyone who does happen to hear from Scott down the road will let me know.
I know I'll miss him in the szine.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are preparing to ``take over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
As Michael Lowrey already has announced, <i>Carolina Command and Commentary</i>
will be opening a Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
This will give me better coverage of the Dixie hobby and provide Michael a 
congenial place from which to publish.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here as 
Gary Coughlan has agreed to take Steve Langley's place as Italy.
Keep an eye on us old geezers here.....
but things look very light on the subszine front specifically in this issue
as my subszine editors appear to be temporarily missing in action for 
various reasons.

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.

<p>
<p>A number of people have tried to contact Mark, but none have hit paydirt
yet.  I hope this one will be solved very quickly!!

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

I've just realized that the 1912 game ending deadline for this game
will unfortunately affect the outcome.
There is likely to be "delaying tactics" popping up soon as players
play the system.
Still, I think a three way draw looks likely. 
The latest blow up has come over Lee Simpson's pointed comments toward
some one or some ones who have been passing E-Mail.
We all know how easy letter passing is in the E-Mail world and I'm
pleased to note that Lee and I share an utter distaste for it.
Go check out the web page for further discussion (I gotta leave you
guys hanging so that some of you might actually go look!).
The Boasters! game is starting up again too and we should have an
update with moves in the next issue.
Remember that the Boasters! game is not actually part of the Worldmasters
structure, it just is a game for fun amongst some of the prominent

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Wed, 24 Jan 2001 21:12:30 GMT)</b>

<p>
Hi folks,
We've started a demo game including an international cast of characters
on the USIN judge.  To include more people, we're playing Modern, which
is, IMHO, the best variant.  We've got the designer, the best player
of the variant, and a couple former world champions on board.
The intent of the game is to watch great players in action, for me to
collect the press to be published at the end of the game in the DipPouch
showcase section, and Jim-Bob Burgess will be publishing the game in
<i>Diplomacy World</i> as it goes along.

<p>
The name of the game is Recount, please sign on as an observer, if you
wish.  Comments from the peanut gallery are allowed, within reason.
(Teasing the various leaders can always be fun.)
We will not be using the game as a forum to discuss political issues,
in spite of the name I chose (on Nov. 8, not coincidentally.)

<p>
An introduction to the players:

<p>
Britain in game `recount' - Name: Christian Dreyer - Country: Sweden:
Christian is a former FTF World Champion, UK champion, and the winner
of the prior game in this series, Ruffians.

<p>
Egypt in game `recount' - Name: Zoltan Toth - Country: Hungary:
Zoltan is a ferociously strong Gunboat player who is up to 4th
place in the Modern HoF on the strength of three victories in this
variant.  He's also won games of a few other variants when I've
been GMing.

<p>
France in game `recount' - Name: Chris Martin - Country: USA:
Chris Martin is another former World Champion, American Champion, and
the only guy who has ever convinced me to help throw a game.  The
latter accomplishment is quite impressive in my mind (I'm not
Jim-Bob, who throws games left and right for kicks.).

<p>
Germany in game `recount' - Name: Twerg - Country: Ireland:
Fearghal `Twerg' O'Donnchu, our representative from Ireland, is a
nasty player who, among other things, pulled off the most impressive
Italy I'd seen in years last year at WDC.  Instead of wasting time
trying to decide between attacking Austria or Turkey, he simply
attacked both and grew exponentially!  Talks faster than anybody
else I know.

<p>
Italy in game `recount' - Name: Eric Person - Country: USA:
Eric Person is the player who has had the most success with this
particular variant.  A student of psychology, Eric is a master at
setting up alliances and positioning himself well for an endgame.
It is quite maddening to lose a game to Eric because his ``ally" won't
defend himself!  (This has happened to me more than once!)

<p>
Poland in game `recount' - Name: Jason Whitby - Country: Australia:
Jason is the leading Modern player from Australia, and comes
highly recommended.  His dedication rating on this judge is
approximately 6900 points higher than Eric's, which readers can
interpret as they wish.

<p>
Russia in game `recount' - Name: Gihan Bandaranaike - Country: United Kingdom:
Gihan is one of the many strong players from the UK who came over
and romped last year at World Dipcon, along with new World Champ
Simon Bouton, Chetan Radia, and Vick Hall.  They won the team
championship as ``Best Asians".

<p>
Spain in game `recount' - Name: Vincent Mous - Country: Denmark:
Vincent Mous is not only the designer of this variant, and in the top
10 at the Modern Hall of Fame, he's also become quite a distinguished
FTF player, reaching the top board at Namur in 1999, among other
accomplishments.  A native Quebecois and resident of Denmark, Vincent
is fluent at many languages, and much beloved by the Francophones.

<p>
Turkey in game `recount' - Name: Frank Johansen - Country: Norway:
Jim-Bob and I met Frank last year at Baltimore's WDC, and we were
both extremely impressed with his ability and poise.  Frank brings a
lot to the table.

<p>
Ukraine in game `recount' - Name: Melissa Nicholson - Country: New Zealand:
Melissa ``Pox" Nicholson is a star in the New Zealand hobby, and
was personally recommended to us by Brandon Clarke.  (I believe
Melissa and Jason are well-acquainted with each other.)  She also
lends the game the grace and delicacy of her gender.  I'm sure she'll
be gentle, like a Margaret Thatcher or Mary Matalin!

<p>
Anybody who wishes to observe the game, just send a message
to the USIN judge (that's at the E-Mail address judge of thekleimans.com) 
with the command observe recount password.  
The first deadline is in early February.

aside about Neil Innes. You are aware, I am sure, of Eric Idle's other

<p>
<i>((Hey, we can get as esoteric as you like.
Recently on r.g.d I was discussing the British version of the Robot Wars
series - I've actually only seen the second series hosted by Red Dwarf's
Craig Charles in a really, really thick regional accent - where 
small robots are challenged by an obstacle course, house robots, and
each other in a fascinating competition.
This filled in a little of my very limited TV watching time between the
two Survivor series ;-) as it appeared on my local PBS station.
I've heard there is an American version on cable somewhere (which I don't have),
but I'm assured it is much inferior to the Brit version.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Warren Goesle (Thu, 18 Jan 2001 18:30:10)</b>

<p>
Jim-Bob,
I see that Puckett and Winfield made it into the Hall.  There's a couple of
others that I thought *should* have made it too, but maybe they will later.

<p>
Puckett will be the LAST player to go into the Hall of Fame having played
all of his career with the Twins.  Heck, he'll be the last player to go in
having played more than 3 years with the Twins.  Sad.
<i>((Thanks for continuing to stand up for the little guys around here.
Right now, I just don't care ;-) since the Red Sox are poised to make a
free agent fueled run.))</i>

<p>
On a happier note, one of the players who didn't get in (and really didn't
deserve to, he only got 1 vote and won't be on next year's ballot), but who
still brings a smile to my face is John Kruk.  That player epitomized that
Phillies team ('92 I think...lost to Toronto in the WS) that had NO
athletes on it.  They looked like a slow-pitch softball team.  I thought
Kruk ought to have a keg sitting next to him at First.

Dear Jim-Bob -
I was sorry to read of Gary's loss, but very happy to read about the 
reconciliation that preceded it.  Mark Fassio and I have exchanged 
sentiments about taking the time to tell your parents that you love 
them, etc., but so many people think that life will go on forever, and 
there will always be time . . . but sometmes there isn't.  Sometimes a 
loved one dies suddenly, and there is no time for any reconciliation, or 
just to tell someone that you're grateful, or that you love them, or 
whatever. 
<i>((Always a good reminder.
My parents and I get along fine (no laughing, Dave....) but I did call
them after I got this note.))</i>
A great many families undergo rifts, and a sense of indignation prevents 
each side from trying to make peace.  If this is you, forget your damned 
indignation.  Make the first overture toward peace.  Having an estranged 
loved one reenter your life is well worth the potential damage to your 
ego.

<p>
It is now too late for me to say anything at all to any of my ancestors; 
I am now the oldest in my line.  But my stepfather, who raised me from 
the age of five, still lives in the house where I grew up, and I am very 
happy to be on very good terms with him; he's ``Dad."  And while it is a 
bit uncomfortable for some men - present company included - to express 
such emotions, I am very glad to know that I have taken the time to tell 
him how proud I am to be known to the world as his son.  I cannot 
imagine how I would feel if he died without my having taken this simple, 
but somehow difficult, step.

My spoiled-rotten daughter, now age six, has begun to develop musical 
taste beyond Christmas carols.  We have thus far managed to avoid N-Sync 
(am I even spelling that correctly?)
<i>((How would I know.... ;-))</i>
and only a limited amount of 
Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera has reached her so far.  But she 
loves to listen to a CD about her favorite cartoon, ``The Powerpuff 
Girls."  The amazing thing is, the damn thing's not bad; I even like a 
few of the tunes myself, proving that I might not be such a dinosaur 
after all.  One of the tunes is by Devo, which is the only mainstream 
(this is how far we have come; I just called Devo ``mainstream") group on 
the disc, but in my opinion, the best stuff is by a British group called 
Bis.

<p>
Now, I am not recommending that everyone on your sub list go out and 
plunk down fifteen smackers just to test my daughter's musical tastes.  
Mozart it ain't.  But there are worse things for kids to listen to.  
Such as, say, Britney Spears.

<p>
The most astonishing item on her list of favorites is from one of MY 
CD's, a collection of hits by The Outlaws.  I am trying to cultivate in 
her ear an appreciation for ``Green Grass and High Tides," one of the 
half-dozen or so greatest tunes of the 70's.
<i>((If we're talking ``great tunes'' it is amazing just how few of these
there were in that decade..... I just keep thinking of the awful dreck of
that decade like Terry Jacks singing ``Seasons in the Sun'' and the Bay
City Rollers.....
I was listening to space/progressive music and classical to escape from
all of this until the Talking Heads, Joy Division, and Elvis Costello
ignited new interests for me in 1977 or 78 or so.))</i>
But so far she resists it 
in favor of the group's cover of ``Ghost Riders in the Sky."  She would 
probably listen to it for an hour straight if I let her, and then ask 
for more.

I'm planning to attend PrezCon in Charlottesville February 23-25.  I 
went last year and had a great time; especially Saturday morning when 
there wasn't a Dip round scheduled.  Instead of playing some other game 
(this event is listed as the Winter National Boardgaming Championships, 
so there's lots more to play than just Calhamer's Epiphany), I went out 
to Shenandoah National Park and hiked all by myself.  (That evening, 
when the rest of the table is comparing notes on which game they played 
that morning, I tell 'em I went out and hiked to the top of a mountain.  
This generally brought confused stares - ``Is there a mountainclimbing 
game at this con?")  I will do it again this year, and am looking 
forward to that almost as much as seeing Dip friends, which is always 
the best part of going to cons.  The games are third.

<p>
(I know; I know.  Spoken like a guy who's never won a con before.  Guilty.)

As for 30 miles south of Dallas being undeveloped...no it still is
undeveloped pretty much.  I live here in Palmer, Texas.  Population maybe
3000.  1 4-way stop sign intersection, no stoplights.  Post Office not open
on Saturday.  No alcohol.  No home mail delivery.  1 gas station, 1 small
neighborhood grocery, 1 restaurant.  One storefront has a medical clinic two
days a week.  Down by the highway a motel and a Subway store, and a weigh
station.  South a little more on I-45 in Ennis or Waxahachie there is more
life (Waxahachie just opened a new Chilis - that's the big news), but here
it is quiet.  To the left of my duplex is a field where horses graze.  To
the right is a trailer where a Mexican guy lives who has roosters in his
yard.  Almost everyone has a pick-up truck.  Down the street is the
barely-used grainery.

<p>
<i>((At first I thought that perhaps Plano had moved south ;-) but that's 
what I recall from when I did some bike riding out there when I lived there.))</i>

<p>
Plano is just north of Dallas...these days Plano is fully
developed (actually it is packed and the traffic is horrible) and just as
full of dry cleaners on every block and Starbucks every 30 feet as the rest
of Dallas.

<p>
<i>((Oh, I know, Plano was GETTING like that in the 1980's when I
lived there briefly and you could see it was just going to look
like the rest of North Dallas.))</i>

<p>
It's actually worse, more snotty rich suburban packed with over-expensive
restaurants and oil-change places....

Jim;  A paucity of live music keeps me from selecting an official live best of 2000.  
BB King, Ali Farka Toure, Staci Eakes and The Mississippi Radio, Roy Rogers with Shana
Morrison, Mahogany Piano are the highlights.  
The tickets I had to Counting Crows and had to give to friends because I was in Buffalo
instead of Berkeley was the low point.  
   
<p>
Regarding CDs, I had been unaware of Ali Farka Toure's new CD and found it so similar 
to his others that I was unappreciative.  The new Counting Crows made my top list; 
as did BB King and Eric Clapton; Taj Mahal and Toumani Diabate ``Kulanjan"; 
and Adrian Ross, Didgereedoo Dreaming are the only truly new CDs I've listened 
to very often in 2000. Kulanjan explores the connection between the Blues and 
Western Mali music.
   
<p>
I almost wish I had a tv, so I could watch Jazz.  Have you been?
<i>((Nope, I have a TV, but don't have cable and hardly ever watch it.
If I did, I don't think ***I*** could find jazz.))</i>

<p>
For more post-election discussion, the Kiersay/Meyer-Briggs Personality 
Institutes are bragging that they predicted in September that Bush would win, 
based upon every election starting in 1900, when an Artisan personality-type 
runs against any other type, the Artisan wins.  Gore is definitely not an Artisan.  
Nor did his campaign do anything to move away from the wonk-image he had, 
including the terribly conceived and planned slogan of ``I will fight for you."  
Who exactly was he going to fight:  congress, my family, lawyers, regulators, 
the police, my neighbors?  Which is to say, ``why do I want a President who 
has to fight, much less for me."  Americans traditionally elect more 
gregarious people, images recently, deal makers and those who grease the wheels.  
Dubya.  And, if it is true as I heard on the radio today that more than 
one governmental department took the ``w" keys off the computer keypads, 
tisk, tisk.  
   
<p>
Most of my friends object when I say that ``Americans elected Bush" or anything similar.  
But, they/we are already whining about Bush's actions and plans.  
Already stopping funding to abortion/birth control internationally.  
I thought the Pope was the most wicked man in the world by not allowing his 
minions to promote birth control, Bush is pushing that now.
   
<p>
Oh well, America elected him, he won the presidency, we shouldn't be surprised.

Jim-Bob,
I happened to be listening to ESPN radio today at lunch, mostly because I
like listening to Tony Kornheiser, and partly because I thought they might
discuss something important, like this weekend's Daytona 500 (I'd forgotten
that ESPN doesn't do NASCAR anymore), but instead he had on a chap named
Dick Vitale (maybe you've heard of him).  
<i>((Nah, I'm not a Prime Time Player and don't want to be one.....))</i>
Ordinarily I'd have switched the
station, but there wasn't much on elsewhere, and something that Vitale
mentioned caught my ear.  He said that there is/almost is/will be a vacancy
in the Men's Head Basketball coaching position at the University of Rhode
Island, and he thought he knew who might be up for the job.  Since I knew
that Jim-Bob would be interested in this I listened further.  Fortunately I
had parked the car by the time he mentioned a former employee of the State 
of Indiana, otherwise I might have run off the road.

<p>
I know that Rhode Island is small, but can you really toss a folding chair
all the way across it?

<i>((Jerry D. indeed has been relieved as of the end of the season, though
just after the announced that he went into the hospital with exhaustion and
George Blaney, his assistant, has been coaching the team.
URI really is a disaster area and it's too bad, because Jerry D. is such a
nice guy and works SO hard.
But he got the job because it was thought he could keep Lamar Odom there
(and despite some memorable back and forth stuff, he couldn't) and he
hasn't really found his own way yet.
As for the future, take it from me, there is no way in Heaven OR Hell that
Bobby K. is coming anywhere near that job.  
It is thought by the Bobby apologists out there that they can rook little
Rhody to reclaim Bobby the way they reclaimed Jim Harrick, but forget it.
They still are trying to deal with internal auditing problems that Harrick
and Jim Jr. created when they were there.
Plus, they don't have much money, Bobby probably could only get 150,000
or so for the job.
There are some interesting candidates out there, but Bobby is NOT one of them.
Lots of people want to bring Tom Penders back from George Washington and 
while Tom says no, I say keep your eye on that one, it has some cherry 
trees in it - Penders still summers near URI and owns a house there.
If not Penders, count on a young coach looking for a chance who views
the A-10 as a move up.

Can they win it all without Svet?  What do you think?  After Catchings went down
for Tennessee, I thought it was in the bag.  (Bad loss at ND notwithstanding.)
But Svet was the leading scorer - a bad player to lose.

Of course, they still have Shea Ralph and Sue Bird.

<i>((Of course they do, but they also have Diana Taurisi!
I saw the game where they beat Tennessee awhile back (without cable, only
the over the air national TV games make it into my house) where Svet
hardly played and I thought they played better with Svet out and Taurisi
on the floor.
They've been suffering all year from the ``Svet's in, no, she's out...''
blues.
They took off on a TEAR, killing and mutilating every team they've played
since she went out.
I think it practically guarantees another national championship and you 
can be sure that's what I'll be rooting for.
Plus in Diana I have the replacement for Shea in my UConn fandom for future
years.
In any case, the future is now.
The descriptions of the runs they've pulled off in the last few games to win
with scores like 78-42 is truly amazing.
Steve Langley has been sending me movie reviews and I really wanted to print
this one since it is tipping me to make sure I see this movie, ``Snatch''.
The previews are stunning, but I was worried that everything was in the
previews, as they are in WAY too many movies these days.))</i>

First a few words about ``Hannibal."  I read the book, I don't want to see a
movie about that book.  I didn't like the ending.

<p>
Now, ``Snatch"

<p>
Guy Ritchie first came to my attention with ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels" which was a crime/comedy sort of movie that had great dialogue and a
nearly incomprehensible if excellently told story.  He's back with ``Snatch"
which is an excellently written nearly incomprehensible story with great
dialogue.  Oh, yeah, it's a crime/comedy movie.  I was reminded of ``Pulp
Fiction".

<p>
Being a foreign film you might think subtitles.  Being the foreign country is
Great Britain you might think subtitles aren't required.  You'd be wrong in
both cases.

<p>
Part of the comedy comes from the various dialects and how even the British
can't always understand each other.  Brad Pitt plays Mickey O'Neal, a Piker
(British slang for Gypsy) who is not to be trusted.  Dennis Farina plays
Cousin Avi, a crook from New York.  Benicio Del Toro (late of ``Traffic")    
plays Franky Four Fingers, a New York gangster working with the Russian
mafia.  There are at least another dozen small and medium sized crooks all
working at odds following interconnected story lines.

<p>
I know I'm easy and I seem to like nearly everything I see, but really, this
is such a good movie.

<p>``So I called up George and he called up Jim, I said let's make a deal.

<p>
He said he'd talk to him.  Gonna start a church where you can save yourself,

<p>
You can make some noise, When you've got no choice...

<p>
You told me useful things, what people think of me, I guess I should thank you.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
REGULAR DIPLOMACY GAME OPENING: FILLED!!!
Matt Sundstrom, James Alan Tretick, Jody McCullough, Doug Kent, Kent Pollard, Warren Goesle, and Don Williams are signed up.
Jim and Matt are paid up, I need $20 from the rest of you,
five dollars of that is for the NMR insurance, which is waivable
(to fifteen for the base fee) if you are on regular E-Mail
or I already have NMR insurance in hand for you from another game
(for example, I have four dollars in hand for Don, five for
Goz, and perhaps some for Kent).
Right now I have no preference lists in hand, so the draw will be
random (recall, I require lists from everyone to avoid a random draw).  
I'll start the game in the next issue, presuming I get money from you guys.
The other Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings'' rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Jack McHugh claims the Federation,
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
The other races in the game are the Klingons, Cardassians, Species 8472,
and the Vulcans.
We ONLY need two more, let's get this one going.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED and Breaking Away games.
I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.
Breaking Away has Jim Tretick, Rick Desper signed up thus far.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of meurglys.com
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) You guys seem pretty active, way to go!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DATELINE: BERLIN):
The Kaiser wishes to inform the world that when the earthquake 
hit mostly in El Salvador, His Excellency was disguised as a somewhat 
poverty stricken US tourist on a beat up old bus heading toward 
Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, and felt not a thing.  

<p>
The esteemed leader also expresses concern as to the state of beer 
in northern Central America. He notes that often the main good aspect was 
its coldness, citing El Salvador as a ``wasteland." 
Based on previous trips while similarly incognito, he reports 
that Moza of Guatemala was still the best quaff in the area, 
but still relatively hard to find.   

<p>
(BOOB to BERLIN): Send some of that beer THISAWAY!

<p>
1) Very bloody this time with loads of retreats.
Check my adjudication please! 
But, I am getting the hang of this variant.
I pretty much GM the game in my head the same way I GM all the other games now,
with a few extra glances at the map, plus careful checking of retreat options.
Did I get them right??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(CHINA-SPAIN): My expectations aren't very high for your continued

<p>
1) Scott Munson has resigned (see note at head of szine) and I have selected
Bruce Linsey to standby and play the position.
Fall deadline is unchanged as Bruce has known about the position for awhile
now and probably already has communicated with most of you.
I think this is Bruce's first postal Diplomacy game in quite some time.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(E to R): At least I know you are the enemy, despite your charming letters.
May you continue to enjoy Denmark, Chris.

<p>
(E to G): I give up on you, Stan. The snail mail situation has defeated me
also.   You have never answered a single letter of mine. You attacked me
when Chris told you to. Why should I try to keep him off Germany?

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that Jody won the game by the victory criterion since he 
had more centers in 1907 (coming from behind counts for more).
Everyone else lined up very nicely (perhaps with a bit of plotting??)
with no tie breaks needed.

<p>
2) I am taking reservations for the Edward Teller game, which will
be the next NYEED 7x7 game in this series.
Since it was asked, I'll remind everyone that we will again be
playing the Black Hole Variant.
Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.
Karl Muller, Harry Andruschak, and Sandy Kenny are on board.

<p>
3) I'll keep the game in here until the Endgame statements or press die out.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WEISS-NUKEMASTER): What is this stuff pulling up rules about tie-breakers?  
There are no tie-breakers in Dip!  If I get into another game I'm nuking you every turn.  
Here I conspire with two other sure losers to create a three-way tie.  
One of the conspirators goes on to win because of a tie-breaker.  Sheesh.  
<i>((Hee, hee, hee, that's why I published the rules again, just to show you
what happens!))</i>

<p>
(RICHARD-JODY): If you knew you'd win by my scheme, then shame on you.  
Pax on your Visa nights and may errant viruses invade your transition 
(Well, that is taking this outside the hobby, so I don't really wish that).
 
<p>
(WEISS-EDWARD TELL HER THAT I'M NOT COMING): Enjoy all.  
I will watch from the sidelines, acid tongue in my own cheek.  
    
<p>
(RICHARD-SWEET SARA): I think I had to take a test about gynecomastia once.  
Didn't see any real cases of it in practice.  Not thought about it much in 6 
plus years.
Drugs, particularly alcohol but most infamously pot were related.  
So, I know that's not the cause.  There are a few serious etiologies, Harry, 
I surely hope you have already ruled those out or do quickly.  
I have my fingers crossed for no explanation, which means no risk, 
just one of those flukes.  Please do keep me informed.

<p>
(WHITEGERMAN to NUKEMASTER): You have slipped, severely slipped, JackBobbey.  
Way slipped.  
You ax (I just spent a weekend in New Orleans and was so delighted to hear 
the proper pronunciation of the verb to inquire about) for abuse and then 
when I give you a slight portion you apologize to me.  
``I thought you might be annoyed."  ``Might be annoyed"  Whoa.  Hold on.  
Dr. Strangelove riding in on each nuke.  
<i>((That was Slim Pickens....))</i>
You pretend you expected us to read the rules.  
<i>((Yes))</i>
You pretend you published the rules.  
<i>((Not only that, I can tell you which issue, it was #215 and you can go
look it up on the Web.
It was my second guess (I tried 214 first), so it wasn't hard.
Not only that, I published the rules WITH the first turn (at the request of
the Miller Number Custodian), so I'm sure you saw them.
No excuse.
Still, please feel free to annoy and harass me about it....))</i>
You resort to ``1984" tactics of rewriting history and going back into 
the <i>TAP</i> files on the internet to change what <i>TAP</i>
barely more than John Boardman had when he was turning 26 included, 
so as to fool the naive.  I am on to you.  Everyone in this game is on to you.  
<i>((Heh, heh, obviously, obviously it is me.))</i>
You are obviously not able to be trusted.  How could 666 and 668 Smith St. 
have been nuked and you still scribble out issues?  
<i>((Because I live at 664....))</i>
We are on to you, and your revisionist creation of history.  
Next you will tell us that Gore won the!! popular vote in the 2000 election 
and that Bush had a larger percentage of the vote cast than in 
either election that Wee Willie ``won."  
<i>((I might....))</i>
You might even convince us that the scoring system for NYEED is 
based upon the Providence men's basketball team W-L percentage.  
<i>((No, the PC men's basketball team W-L percentage is too good for
that, and getting better!!!))</i>
Try it.  You are not fooling me.  
And don't try to mollycoddle me by saying I might be annoyed.  
Annoyed is not the word.  Try enjoyed.  Enjoyed the game thoroughly.  
Thank you for the fun and the ability to abuse you and pick on those 
other tender-skin players.  
Next thing you know we'll hear that John Boy survived the nuclear blasts as well.  
As you know, I moved from Beale St. before the blasts occurred there.  
And when anyone watched the Giants games broadcast from PacBell Park they 
could see the remnants of Beale ST - yup, McCovey Cove.  
I still wish they'd called it JackBobbey cove.  Again, enjoyed.  
Thanks for the fun all.  
Sorry I take on this jecklish personality.  
Think I will go Hyde now.
<i>((Didn't you already do that!!!???))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Scott Munson has resigned and Steve Emmert replaces him in the position. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE VIENNA UNDERGROUND):
Ambassador Pollard was last seen purchasing a case of fine cognac just 
before embarking on a train which eventually took him to the gates of 
Moscow.  Gone where the bright,brass bands playing the hymns of the Nation's 
victories.  A cold winter had settled in, and the Austrian armies scattered 
throughout Russia, huddled down into the snows....and waited.

<p>
(MOSCOW): Governmental Press Release -
A day of mourning shall be observed in remembrance of General Brahms who was 
killed in action while attending the theater in Budapest.
Services will be held in Warsaw on Dec. the 12th (at 7:00 p.m.)
<i>((Huh, did I miss something????
Let's bring Emmert into this, his wife is an Opera star, perhaps he can help....))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): Wait a minute.  A standby call - for a
twelve-dot power?  Jim-Bob, it isn't supposed to work this way.  You know,
I'm supposed to get a two-dot exile position.  Do I have to promise to
behave myself, or something?  Or is this just a sympathy assignment, since
I'm getting waxed so badly in So Good, and you don't want to lose me from
the hard-copy sub list?
<i>((Just lucky, I guess.... now do you have any idea what Kent is
talking about???))</i>

<p>
(EMMERT to MORRIS): Now I get to bug you on a regular basis about the
irregular publication schedule of <i>The Flat Head Society</i>.  
So, why is it that you get these troublesome interruptions right 
AFTER I give you twenty bucks?   Hmmm?
<i>((You mean you gave money to HIM, a used car dealer???
Are you insane???
Oh, I forgot, you're a lawyer....))</i>

<p>
(MORRIS to WORLD): Please email me at Scottm221 of aol.com or call Tuesdays or Wed at 
1-800-380-4536.(9 to 7 PM EST) The French foreign office is open for any 
offers. Why don't we try diploming or something! Par LAY Vu Dip?

<p>
(EMMERT to BOARD): I gotta admit, there's something cool about taking over a
position where you start out with boats in Edinburgh and Constantinople.  
Anybody want to sweet-talk the newcomer?  

<p>
(NEAR THE BORDER): A farmer to a Turkish Soldier -
I tell you!  It does not matter!
You, the people of the Sultan.
You come this way, and the Austrian comes from the other.
Will next the Italian come through here as well?
It is better to prepare for Death now while we have time to do 
so, for soon we will run out of time.
We will, as they say in the West, ``All the Way. Processed"...
<i>((Double huh??? Oh well....))</i>

<p>
(2ND ARMY GROUP): Commanded by General Munchousen to the Opposing Italian 
and Turkish Forces -
It is with great distress to my country that you have seized our beloved cities.
Admiral Von Sherrhodt and the fleets will be sorely missed.
Our dream of an Austrian Navy has been blown and scattered, like the 
leaves of a Wartorn village.
I must say that I had vested images of Glory and Battle in this War.
It would seem that I will gain only the one...
<i>((At least I THINK I understand that one!  ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
(SONG): As the Battleship Brantschpohl slipped beneath the waves,
(scuttled by her own crew) a sailor's song broke out upon the night,
``Farewell and Adieu ye ole Spanish lady...
farewell and Adieu ye ladies of Spain..."

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The RAG has been discarded and burned.
It's not over until it's over, but no RAGging is required. 

<p>
2) Lots of retreats around here, some of them REAL interesting.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to TURKEY): Sorry buddy, I need Tunis more than you do.  I have to
keep at three in order to play any role in the game and keep the other two
dots I have.  I trust this isn't much of a disappointment to you, maybe even
a favor...

<p>
(TURK-IN-EXILE to AUSTRIA): Dork, schmork.  You've done a great job in 
this game.  When you started, I wouldn't have bet twelve cents on your 
chances to survive another two years.  But you're kickin' ass an' takin' 
names.  My hat's off to you.  And if you wait just a moment, I'll moon 
you, too.

<p>
(STEVE to JIM-BOB): I will confess to being very disappointed at the 
underwhelming response from lawyers for The Professional Division.  I 
would have thought we would be chomping at the bit to see who got to 
throw out the first insurance company, and the lies would be flyin' by 
now.  (Sigh.)  I concur with Goz's suggestion; let's invite anyone else 
in a profession dominated by liars.  Press agents, spin doctors, 
appraisers, politicians; they should all be welcome, but you should 
screen the applicants for quality.  We can't allow anyone from an 
honorable profession.  This is SUPPOSED to be a den of iniquity.
<i>((What about used car dealers????  Hyork, hyork, hyork.....))</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA): (In my best Reagan imitation)  ``There you go again . 
. ."

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY):  Good choice.... isn't Ronnie one of Russ's heroes??

<p>
(STEVE to GOZ): Yeah, right.  Rub it in with the Blackhawks.  Come by 
sometime and I'll show you the bag I wear over my head during Canadiens 
games.
<i>((I hear the Canadiens might be moving to Norfolk or Virginia Beach....))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): I doubt Goz will vote for the RAG draw, 
unless you reconfigured it to a GAR.  First among equals, and all that.
<i>((Ahhhh, you're all just a bunch of fish anyway!!!))</i>

<p>
(SU to RICHMOND): I haven't been keeping track of the Spiders performance
this year, but my Orange are in good shape.  They just had a big win against
the Hoyas in the Dome.

<p>
(SPIDER to ORANGE): Forget it.  The season ended, as far as I'm concerned, on
Saturday evening when the Spiders lost to James Madison (currently in eighth
place in the conference) by two points.  Since we can't go to the conference
tournament, the best possible finish is 21-6, and that requires them to win
all of their last five games (including two against first-place VCU).  With
this conference's RPI, there's no way we can get an at-large bid.  At least
pitchers and catchers report February 13.
                    
<p>
(BOOB CROWS): Yeah, baseball, bring on dem Yankees, we Red Sox are finally
ready to knock 'em off!!!
                  
<p>
(JAMES to WORLD): Speaking of SU, something has to be done about the Big
East.  I don't like the two divisions one bit.  14 is simply too many teams.
It is time to rationalize the Big East and require all of the schools to be
in for both basketball and football.  Notre Dame either brings in their
football team or takes a hike in basketball.  Temple has a good basketball
team, but the conference carries their horrible football team.  In football,
the Big East needs to add UCONN (they go DIV 1 next year I think) and Notre
Dame.  In basketball they need to add Temple and drop Providence, St John's,
NOVA, Georgetown, and Seton Hall.  I hate to lose all of those basketball
teams with their history, but the league doesn't make sense anymore.  Let
them go off and form another basketball only conference.  Losing the NYC
metro area would be a problem, but if there were only 10 teams we could go
back to home and away games.  What do you think?

<p>
(BOOB to JAMES): I hate your idea and generally love the balancing act that Mike
Tranghese has done with the conference, but you're looking at
it through Syracuse (good in both football and basketball) eyes.
;-)

<p>
(JAMES to WORLD): I didn't think it would go down to well with a PC fan.  As an
alternative, I'd love to see them kick out some of the teams that are in only due to
football really (W.Virginia, Miami, Rutgers, V. Tech) and get back to a
basketball league that makes sense.  I really don't care about football
much, I just want a rational basketball league with home and away
pairings! 

<p>
(BOOB to JAMES [Wednesday, January 31, 2001 10:57 PM]):
PC beat Villanova tonight and continues to play really, really well.
St. John's should be very afraid on Saturday.
<i>((And they weren't afraid enough, so NOW they are mad for the
upcoming rematch..... John Linehan for All Big East First Team,
he's embarrassed every point guard except Syracuse's and that only
because he hasn't had the opportunity!))</i>
I would go with the basketball only league (this is basically the
way it used to be!), but money won't allow it.

<p>
(JAMES to WORLD): I guess SU is lucky that they don't play PC given 
how well they have been
playing.  Given the screwed up league we don't even play PC this year!
What's with UCONN this year?  I don't think they will make the NCAAs unless
they do something in the tournament.
<i>((UConn just has no team chemistry, they will make a late run, though,
I think.
It will cement an NIT spot, but no more.))</i>
Oh well, I agree with you that we probably have the best league situation
that is feasible, but I still don't like it.  I just can't understand how
you can have a league where some teams don't play others at all!  I don't
like having a team's success or failure depend so much on who they happen to
play twice, who they play once and where, and who they don't play at all.
There are so many good teams (and no great ones) in the Big East this year
that I don't think it has made much of a difference, but it will in the
future.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) When I add your replenishment card from now on, it always will be the LAST
card in your list. 

<p>
2) There are now six riders essentially dropped from the pack, which is quite
amazing.
And Alfred the Great and Broke Leg Meg each have four threes, 
but at least Alfred is going to slip across the finish
line with one of those.

<p>
3) There are five more scores to be claimed (10,8,6,4,2) and if I were really
smart I would have figured out who would score them, but there are a bunch
of tie breakers (and amazingly some of the riders at 116 can't make it across!)
so I'll figure it out next time.
But it does look like Eric will beat out John for Second Place overall.
Ummmm, is it Darrell C, Alfred the Great, Mad Hatter, Mark, and John in
that order??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOSPELERS to ALICE):  We have to hand it to you;  we don't know how you did
it, but you sure proved your superiority in this game.

<p>
(ALICE):  Mark gets a card!  Brits slip to third...  gotta get some new
glasses.

<p>
(HERALDS OF CHRIST to CARROLLINGIAN CHARACTERS):  On the other hand, we hope to
give the Brit Pack all they can handle in the race for second place!

<p>
(MAD HATTER to MARCH HARE): Go!

<p>
(MARCH HARE to MAD HATTER): You go!  The Queen is watching!

<p>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.

<p>
3) John Schultz has a new phone number and an E-Mail address.  
As far as I can tell to this point, he seems to check both only
during the week and not on weekends, but as they are new to him,
this may not be accurate.
In any case, you can leave voice mail messages directly for him
on the phone number.

<i>((It is not aimed at you, and the Mekons don't confuse just you either.
In any case, the point is NOT to confuse, but to enlighten.... I'm patient
about it.))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY AND BRITAIN): No offense intended but will you make up your 
minds whether you're friends or foes?
I know, let's leave Eng alone, the oceans are beautiful without military 
presence in them.

<p>
(KENT OZOG to JEFF O'DONNELL): I just want you to know that there are 
no hard feelings about your Egyptian invasion of Turkey.
I realize that this is just a game and that betrayal is simply a part of it.
My apologies for not responding to your letter.
Maybe someday we can be allies in another game.
I hope we can still be friends, yours truly, Kent.

<p>
(BOOB SAYS): Now isn't THAT special!!!

<p>
(ROME-MADRID): One last act of defiance before we solidify our alliance!

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Here's Johnny (Snirkt) What bub! Never saw I man with claws 
before.

<p>
(ROME): Rumor has it the Flying Brain is pulling the Floating Brain's
electrodes.

<p>
(ROME-CAIRO): I guess Italian legions will never get to visit the
pyramids...sigh.

<p>
(ITALY-GM): Do you know how many times I have officially flipped?  I have
lost count.
<i>((I have some sort of idea.... the question is, have you actually 
BECOME Kent???
That would be quite a flip.))</i>        
            
<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): Even more confused; I received a tactical analysis from
the Klingons on our Romulan/Ferengi situation and the Klingons believe that the
Romulans are about to attack the Ferengi.
The Romulans have maneuvered into and/or surrounded four Ferengi star bases.
This report looks on the surface to be too good to be true.
We have received no communication from the Romulans or the Ferengi, so 
all we can do is wait and see.
We still have no real intelligence
<i>((That's for sure!!!  
Whoops, never mind, it goes on....))</i>
as to the whereabouts of Chekov and Spock.
Kirk out.

<p>
(SEAN-JEFF AND THE MEKONS): Tell you both what if you both quit then I'll stop 
all my press. Anyone agreed????? Hands.?
<i>((I'm certainly not going to stop until Jeff does, and probably not even then.
Since I run things around here, I control the press, and besides, I LIKE press!!!
Bring it on.....
of course, I'd love it more if Jeff got E-Mail and typed it for me.))</i>

<p>
(SPANISH NEWS): ........................ We're speechless.
<i>((You KNOW we don't believe that, and the evidence to the 
contrary is overwhelming....))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): Great, all we need now is to get some nukes or something I want 
to blow something sky high though if we did my first choice and top priority 
is the GM and a close second by the Mekons and an extremely close third is 
the Star Trek press writer my dear uncle. Though the funny thing is I'm 
still growing up I think he never did.

<p>
(EGYPT to SPANISH PRESS): Is it possible you could print something I understand?
(is it possible you could say something I understand?)

<p>
(BERLIN to LONDON): You know, you've got a bigger mouth than you do a 
brain....
