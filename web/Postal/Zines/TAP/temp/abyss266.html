<br /><br />We have a full set of subszines below.
Check them all out!
And I've pushed the deadlines back to line up with World DipCon and this delay.
I shouldn't have tried to slip in another Christmas deadline, boy did THAT 
not work.
Plus I've been very involved with the WorldMasters E-Mail tournament, taking
another round on the Tournament Management Committee, and Stephen Agar and
I are looking for someone to head up <i>Diplomacy World</i>.
And in your spare time, send me nominations for this year's Hobby Awards!
I'll see YOU at World DipCon because you're all going to come.
Only 66 bucks a night in the Denver Hyatt Tech Center for Internet bookings
and cheap airline prices, how can you miss it???  
February 14-16, be there or I'll not bother to speak to you ever again.... 
mostly kidding, but come along.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had this ALL done to all practical purposes on January 1, the date at
the top here, but I'm typing this on January 17, the first day I've had
time to get back to this and finish it.  Yuck, if I can't turn this around,
perhaps I do need to consider other things.  One thing is that I'm in WAY
too many games, I'm cutting that back toward zero as of right now!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />"Our discontent, Ooooh! these lonely cries; Seasons change, why do you never
ask why?; Winter, winter, I'll put the wheels back on; In the winter."
Excerpts from "Winter" by the Mekons, the best rock and roll band in the
whole damned world, and one of the few that still LIVE it; from their
2002 Best Rock Album of the Year, <i>Oooh!</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />And now I get to the usual header stuff.
I decided to can the sub price increase, the postal rate increase
really is peanuts, or it seems so at the 3-5 ounce level that I live it.
So, no problem, let's keep selling subs when I can at this price.
You all know that I'm an incredible softie anyway.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance See the revised game start announcements below!

 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:

Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this is THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ED HENRY (AND BERRY RENKEN IS FOUND!!!)</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Find him and win the fifty buck prize!!
You have until Issue number 270 to find him.
I want to tell Ed about Kathy and all sorts of other things.
There is a "full board" there now, help me out and earn
yourself some cash!!!
Ed Henry was very active in the hobby in the 1980's.
I don't think he's the same Ed Henry who's so famous right now working
on Kiplinger's magazine (writes the Car reviews and is African American),
but he could be.
Ask him and find out!
But also, Berry Renken found himself and we have a hint about Bill Quinn!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Berry Renken or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Subject: The Search for me...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hello Jim!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is Berry,  the Dutch guy you have on your list in <i>TAP</i> of "Dip People To 
Be Found" - it's time for me to be found, I guess... I'm very sorry for not 
contacting you earlier, and thanking you for continuing to send me your zine 
so faithfully without hearing back from me for almost 3 years.  Explained in 
a nutshell, I was too much of a hermit at first and too busy later to seek 
contact with you or anyone else in the gaming hobby again. I did write to 
Chris Dickson a while ago, thanking him for wanting to find me while also 
asking him not to find me yet, so to speak... but I didn't hear anything back 
from him on that, I hope nothing horrible happened to him?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No worries, Chris is A-OK, at least he was the last time I heard from him
a month ago or so.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am currently being very happy together with a wonderful lady, my sweet 
Melinda. She's American, we're living in Gresham, a suburb of Portland, 
Oregon. She and I "met" via the internet about half a year ago, we got to 
know each other very well writing multiple e-mails to each other each day,  
and now we're living together. And, if Goodness allows, we'll continue to do 
so for the remainder of our lives. Such things do happen. Apparently. :) A 
year ago I wouldn't have believed for a second this would be possible, let 
alone for me, but stubborn pessimists can be wrong too sometimes, I guess...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please consider the $25 "reward for me finding me", so to speak, payment for 
all the TAP issues you sent me. I'd very much appreciate it if you would 
continue to send me your zine, to where I am now (765 SE Mt. Hood Hwy., 
# B210, Gresham, OR 97080), though I'd understand very well if you wouldn't, as 
I can't send you any money yet - funds will be kind of low for Melinda and me 
until I get residential status here, and a job, hopefully that'll happen 
within a few months from now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No need, this ensures you KEEP getting the szine for free!
Welcome back, we've missed you, far more than you could know.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As to the gaming hobby, I'm not going to have either the time or the 
inclination to do any sort of zine publishing again, but I'd very much like 
to get into contact again with several people in the hobby, and get into a 
game or two as well.

I found Bill a few years ago..when I was sending out hundreds of postcards

The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

See http://www.cat23.com/wm02 for full details.  Since I didn't get sufficient
interest to get a team in, I am back on the WorldMasters Tournament Management
Committee again.
There already is a big flare up between a GM and a player where the player now
says he doesn't "trust" the GM, and it's only 1901!
But in general, things seem to be going PRETTY smoothly for a tournament that got
way overwhelmed with 73 teams of 7 players, for a total tournament player roster
of 511!!!
All seventy-three games are up and running with GMs in mere days, an amazing
feat in itself.
Kudos to Tournament Director Rudi van Hal for a yeoman job thus far!!!!

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older
version of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.

Let me stick in a note I just got from Fred Davis next.  It is a copy of a letter
sent to Phil Reynolds that Fred also wants me to publish here.  
Phil has been trying to finish a final issue of the <i>Zine Register</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Fred Davis (December 26, 2002)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Phil,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been trying to get certain information about the status of the North American
Variant Bank and the "Hoosier Archives" out to the Diplomacy people ever since last
April.
I sent this information to both Jim Burgess and Stephen Agar, who are the co-editors
of <i>Diplomacy World</i>.
I asked them to print this in the next issue of <i>DW</i>, and also to print it in 
Burgess' own zine, <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>, when they had time to do so.
Unfortunately, there hasn't been an issue of <i>DW</i> since March 2002.
And, for some reason, Burgess has not printed it in his <i>TAP</i>
(He may be waiting for it to first appear in <i>DW</i>, but he hasn't given me
any reason for the delay).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'll clear all of that up pretty quickly right now, the notice that Fred
wanted published, I thought was more appropriate (as I think did Stephen) for
<b>Diplomacy World</b>, but you can see above where that is.
Given that problem, it seems I should get off my butt and publicize Fred's note,
which I do below.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you haven't already gone to press with the next issue of the <i>Zine Register</i>,
I'd appreciate it if you could print this information therein.
People ought to have this information.
I've sent word to a few people, but not to the whole hobby.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I hope Phil can publish soon too, so I can go ahead with my plans to
update the postal section of the Diplomatic Pouch.
I've finally taken off some REALLY old stuff there, but other things need updating badly.
Now to what Fred wants us all to see... and remember that I send this to pretty much
all of what remains of the US postal hobby, so that probably publicizes it better
than ZR would.))</i>

It's been consolidated with the United Kingdom Variant Bank (UKVB) run by Stephen Agar.
Orders for maps and rules of Dip Variants should be sent to Agar at:
47 Preston Drove, Brighton  BN1 6LA, ENGLAND.
<i>((Or looked up on the Internet at: www.variantbank.com where 455 of the 1410

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A few of the most popular Variant designs, as well as copies of his own designs,
are still available from Fred Davis, 3210-K Wheaton Way, Ellicott City, MD  21043.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Hoosier Archives, a collection of most of the World's Diplomacy zines published
between 1963 and 1978, have been donated to the following institution:
Popular Culture Library, Jerome Library, Bowling Green State University, Bowling
Green, OH  43403.  Telephone: (419) 372-2450.  Ask for Linda Babcock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I correspond with Linda frequently and much of TAP is on file there as well.
I urge all remaining postal szine editors to send Linda copies of your szines.
Since they are an official non-profit, you can even deduct the cost of THAT mailed
issue from your taxes, minor for sure, but hey, why not?
I plan to visit Linda there someday and spend a day or two going through the archives.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Certain other archivists have also sent their material to be associated with the
Diplomacy file at Bowling Green.
For example, Fred Davis has sent them a copy of his anthology, <i>The Best of 
Bushwacker</i>, covering the publication of that Dipzine from 1972 to 1991.
Anyone else wishing to dispose of Diplomacy files is asked to donate them to
Bowling Green University instead of throwing them away.
These files are available for review, and photocopies can be made, if the interested
party will submit a request in advance.

and I think that includes shipping costs, I know I deduct the cost of the postage

So, if that matters to you enough to tip the scales, overload Linda with more
material.
Thanks, Fred, sorry again for the delays in getting this out.))</i>

Subject: Change of e-mail address and Octopus' Garden status

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, to dispose of the second bit last, Octopus' Garden is still in
official indeterminate status (or should that be stasis)?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
However, in the meantime, note that my e-mail address is changing, from
peter of manorcon.demon.co.uk to:
peter of burdonvale.co.uk

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story behind this is that my cable company, NTL, have finally got
broadband internet available for my area. I did consider staying with 
Demon and getting broadband from them instead, but the cost of ASDL from

Tell me anything you like about the year of 2002 or other recent past in music.
List a top two, a top ten, or a top 100, I don't care, just tell me something!!
I've got a bunch of things to say that will pop in shortly, but right now
I am mourning the loss of Mary Hansen of Stereolab in a cycling accident.
She apparently was riding her bicycle on a London street, was hit, and 
that was it.
Her backing vocals and multi-instrumental talents were part of the 
connoisseur's adoring view of the band's brilliance.
Stereolab has been amazingly consistent through their dozen or so albums
in the last decade or so, and have been one of my favorite bands since 
their debut, though they don't rank number one....
My beloved Mekons continue to show that they remain THE best rock and roll
band on the planet with their latest release, "OOOH! (OR, Out Of Our Heads!)".
I will have more to say soon on what should be everyone's record of the year.
Boo and hiss me for hitting you with "should's" if you like, but it is still
my claim.
They really are amazing in their continuing depth and breadth, on which I 
will pontificate more soon.

Hi Jim... I saw this exchange in the comments on the Slashdot weblog 
about Armadillo Aerospace's amateur rocket launch.  (It failed when a 
slip-on battery connector came off, cutting power to the guidance computer.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, why would any one name a rocket after an animal that doesn't 
even fly."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The armadillo may not fly, but it can "launch" very well. Its defense 
mechanism is to jump straight up when frightened, and adults can jump 
three to four feet into the air. This, and its habit of wandering down 
roads at night, has made it a major cause of highway fatalities in Texas 
IIRC. It's not like having a dragonfly hit the windshield at 70 mph - 
more like an armor-plated bowling ball."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Did you see that in your Texas days, Jim?  Jeez.  It would be worth 
buying a Ferrari just to have such a sloped windshield.

Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received the "Jazz" DVD set for my birthday this fall and have been
viewing/listening to it ever since.  As I mentioned before, I enjoy listening
to most of the repertoire up to the introduction of be-bop, which I'm still not
able to fathom.  I also dislike the over-use of the cymbals in more recent
jazz.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
However, I was surprised by the segment on Thelonious Monk.  I went out and got
a CD of Monk's solo piano from the library, and I really enjoyed listening to
it.  For one thing, there are no cymbals, and for another, piano is my
principle instrument, so I can probably "hear" it better than most other
instruments.  But the music also made sense to me at some level (I'm sure I'm
still missing a lot of it, but there's no harm in understanding only a part of
something.)  You can tell just by listening that this man was a thinker.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm looking for another suggestion from you or your readers.  If I want to
purchase some music by Monk (I'm thinking solo piano but I'm willing to take
suggestions,) what would you recommend?

<i>((I'm sure there are those around here more expert than I am.
My big jazz days were when I was in college in the late 1970's and learned jazz
on the air with a morning radio show that I had for a year paying dues while I was trying
to get on one of the coveted late night Progressive Rock slots.
I think the one you got out of the library is probably the record called
<b>Pure Monk</b> and that was as I recall a late career thing from the early 1970's.
I didn't like it all that much.
Better, I think is the <b>Alone in San Francisco</b> album that I used to play a lot.
I don't own either of these and haven't heard them in over twenty years, but I looked
up the SF solo record on the Internet to remind me that I hadn't been misremembering
and a Monk website has this review of that record:

that about matches the way I remember it.
A more with-it expert comment would be welcome.
Monk is wonderful, but quite weird.
His "band" records are an exercise in confusion at times, since the band is always
trying to keep up with the strange notes that come from Monk.
I agree with you, I generally like his solo stuff better and I'd highly recommend the
one I know, but have no idea if he did anything better elsewhere.))</i>

"The Emperor's Club" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kevin Kline is good.  He really is a comedian.  But he is also a fine actor.  
He demonstrates that in "The Emperor's Club".  The buzz was that this could 
have been titled "Dead Poets' Society 2".  An easy mistake to make if you 
haven't seen the two movies.  There are similarities, of course, but then 
they share those similarities with "Dawson's Creek", and "Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer", don't they?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a story about a man whose whole life is about teaching, and a boy 
whose whole life was about privilege, and not needing to be taught.  Theirs 
was a clash of character.  There was no winner.  The teacher learned 
something.  Sadly, the boy didn't.

"Die Another Day" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The "Bond" formula still works for me.  Toss a secret agent into a complex 
situation and watch him simplify it by blowing things up, while doing all 
sorts of extraordinary stunts with cars, plane, skis, et al.  Hollywood came 
up with a new very good idea in "Tomorrow Never Dies" when they made a 
counterpoint to "Bond" with Michelle Yeoh as a female super agent.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Halle Berry plays "Jinx" a female "James Bond" who was trying to kill a man 
that "Bond" wanted to question.  Neither of them actually succeeded when they 
first met.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story starts with a surfing scene and moves on to an undercover operation 
where "Bond" is infiltrating a North Korean arms merchant's base.  He is 
betrayed, and so has to fall back on plan `B' where he blows up everything in 
sight.  Plan `B' is more or less successful except that "Bond" is captured 
and tortured for the next fourteen months.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He is traded for one of the men who escaped the plan `B' operation, a Korean 
spy.  The reason the trade was made is because "Bond's" side think that he 
broke and was starting to leak secrets.  He is essentially traded from one 
unpleasant prison to another.  Once the situation is explained to him, he 
escapes and starts his own campaign to uncover his betrayer, and regain the 
traded Korean Spy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cut to the opening credits...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pierce Brosnan is really good as "James Bond".  He has the charisma, and is 
convincing as an action hero.  Too bad he is going to be too old to keep 
doing it.  Time to dig into the next generation for a brand new "James Bond".

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is difficult to know quite what to say. If you are a fan of "Harry Potter" 
then you have already seen or are about to see the movie, and you are already 
familiar with the story.  If you are not a fan, then you probably have no 
interest, so my telling you about the story would be a wasted effort.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The three kids are amazingly good.  Especially Rupert Grint who has "Ron 
Weasley" nailed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kenneth Branagh was perfect as "Gilderoy Lockhart".  I'm still wondering why 
"Dumbledore" didn't see right through him from the start.  "Harry and Ron" 
certainly did.  I've had the thought since I read the book.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I though Jason Isaacs' "Lucian Malfoy" was excellent.  Just the right amount 
of arrogance.  Tom Felton's "Draco Malfoy" was just as good.  The two of them 
drip evil.

We can look ahead to Book Four and look forward to more evil from Isaacs,
though I can't see how they can't split Book Four into two movies
(I hope they do).
The special effects were better in this movie, and the kids were great, but
I really missed the staging of scenes like Nearly Headless Nick's "party"
with our three heroes.
In what I'll call a mini-theme, John Cleese again was heavily underused here.
I worry about what they'll cut in the next two books, but I too can hardly wait.))</i>

"The Ring" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When "The Ring" first came out I resisted it.  The trailers laid out the 
premise.  There is a video tape that if you watch it you die seven days 
later.  Not even a good urban legend I thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This weekend I worked part of the time and decided not to buck the "Harry 
Potter" crowds, and, inexplicably, "The Ring" was still showing.  I figured 
maybe there was more to it than I had first thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There was.  Excellent writing for one thing.  The movie starts with two 
teenage girls together, alone at night and slightly bored.  One tells the 
`seven days' urban legend, and the other panics slightly.  She thinks she has 
seen the video.  Things are quietly spooky with good camera work, and good 
mixture of tension and relief, and more tension.  Without being too explicit, 
the girl who saw the tape dies and her friend loses her sanity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Enter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), investigative reporter, aunt to the dead 
girl.  Rachel's sister asks her to find out what happened.  Rachel starts 
asking questions.  She soon discovers that her niece and three friends had 
watched the tape together.  All four of the kids are dead.  One, a suicide, 
two in a car accident, and one possibly frightened to death.  They all died 
at the same minute of the same day, seven days after watching the tape.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rachel follows the teens back to where they saw the tape.  She finds the 
tape, and watches it.  Then she gets a phone call.  A voice whispers `seven 
days' and hangs up.  Rachel is spooked and is finding the whole thing hard to 
understand and harder to believe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bit by bit she uncovers a tale of madness and death that explains part of 
what is going on.  Only part.  But then, she only has seven days and is 
starting to go a little mad herself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots better than I expected, and then some.

"8 Mile" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It has been a few days since I saw `8 Mile' and I have been thinking about it 
a lot.  Before it hit the big screen there was a lot of controversy over 
whether Eminem could make the move from rapper to movie actor.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The concensus seems to be that he has, in spades.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Jimmy Smith Jr aka Rabbit aka B Rabbit aka Jimmy Rabbit" starts out in the 
movie so nervous that he heaves.  He is about to go up on the stage and do 
battle in front of a crowd of his peers.  He is white and the crowd is black, 
and that isn't what this is about at all.  They are his peers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is 8 mile, the part of Detroit where poor blacks and poor whites live 
lives of desperation.  They live off day dreams of going platinum.  Some rap 
star will hear them and be so impressed that they will give them a contract.  
That's the dream.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One way to chase the dream is to go up on the stage and do battle.  Two 
rappers have 45 seconds to develop a rap riff to destroy the other.  Rabbit 
wins the toss and elects to go last.  His opponent raps a bit about how 
Rabbit really has nothing to say.  Then Rabbit steps up to the mike and 
chokes.  He has nothing to say.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He has just broken up with his girl.  She wanted him to marry her and played 
the pregnancy card.  Bad move on her part.  He bailed.  He did leave her his 
car.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He moved back in with his mom, who lives with his little sister in a trailer. 
She also lives with her current lover, who is a kid that Rabbit went to high 
school with.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kim Basinger really deserves a best supporting actress nomination for the 
role of Rabbit's mom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
His friends back him up, even though he choked.  They know he can rap.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The world of 8 mile is bleak.  Living off dreams is sad. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can Eminem act?  Hard call.  The character Rabbit was totally three 
dimensional.  Compelling!  But was it acting?  Eminem lived in the 8 mile 
neighborhood.  He rapped his way out.  Got to wonder if he was acting or just 
being himself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Either way he made an outstandingly good movie.

"Santa Clause 2" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Eight years have passed and Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has become the best 
Santa ever.  Then, a month before the deadline he finds out about the other 
Santa Clause, the Mrs. Clause.  He has to be married by Christmas Eve of his 
eighth year on the job.  It isn't exactly clear to me why the elves waited so 
long to let him in on the news.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie seemed to have all the same people.  At least the head elf, Scott 
and son Charlie, Scott's ex-wife and her new husband were all there.  Scott 
has a niece now, who with the inexorable logic of a small child, has him 
pegged as Santa.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a kid's movie mostly.  There are a couple of adult jokes that were 
probably over the kids heads.  The first third of the movie was a little 
slow.  One small girl sitting right behind me even went so far as to say "I'm 
bored".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then we got to the scene where Scott discovers Comet who has been pigging out 
on Christmas Sweets.  Comet is magical, and so is able to eat a whole lot of 
sweets.  Just seeing him with his reindeer legs sticking out from his huge 
body was pretty funny, but when he farted he really got the kids into the 
movie.  From that point on it was nothing but laughs.

"Empire" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Empire" isn't the sort of Empire that say Bush is setting up, no, it is the 
name of the product that Vic Rosa (John Leguzamo), an independent 
businessman, provides to his clientele.  Vic has people who sell for him, he 
has his family of friends who keep things running smoothly, and he has the 
people he works for (in this case independent businessman isn't all that 
independent) who supply him and his competitors with the product.  It is a 
complex business full of internal and external pressures.  And, as Vic puts 
it, it's the sort of business where if you make a mistake you stand to lose 
more than your stock options. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Vic is ambitious.  He has a woman he loves, and a child coming, and he wants 
a better more secure life for them.  That means he will have to somehow 
become legitimate, and, even more challenging, sever his ties with his 
business associates.  Business associates who don't like change.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story has a complex plot.  The trailers gave away a small part of it.  
Too bad actually.  The trailers are something of a spoiler.  The story is 
also (credit here to Leguzamo) an interesting character study.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hey Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Prompted by an overnight power outage, during which both my usual work and
my usual play became unavailable, I went through a huge backlog of mail
last night.  It is one of my quirks that I rarely even look at my mail and
it will pile up literally for months. (Among other things, I discovered
last night that I've been driving without insurance for a month and a half
... but I'm renewed again as of this afternoon.)  <i>TAP</i>s tend to pile up even
longer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been busy for the past few months, corresponding almost exactly to the
end of the baseball season - if you count the first round of the playoffs
as the end of the season, which I do - so I'm only just now starting to
catch up on the A's.  I had totally missed that there was a weekend when it
looked like Billy Beane really would go to Boston. By the time I heard
about it, it was already resolved and he was back in Oakland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A brief retrospective on last season:  Now that it's happened three years
in a row, people are starting to seriously wonder if there's something
about the A's team strategy that makes it not just a coincidence that they
compete well in the regular season and consistently choke in the playoffs.
It was a little different this time, though. The past two years against the
Yankees, the series were close because both teams played well, so you can't
really say that the A's choked. But in Minnesota this year, we just played
bad. I don't know if it looked that way to the national audience, but I've
watched enough games to know what the A's can do, and they were playing way
under their potential in Minnesota, even in the games they won.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It raises an interesting question, about whether the A's need to really
splurge one year so that they can win a World Series. It probably *isn't*
an either/or proposition, but supposing it is - supposing that you have a
choice between being a team that is a perennial contender but never goes
all the way, or a team that wins the World Series and then has a fire sale
and sucks for the next five years - which would you choose?  As a fan, I'd
rather have it like the A's and be always competitive even if they never
win the whole thing. From a business point of view, I'd guess that's the
better approach as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't think it's quite that simple.  I don't think there's anything
inherent in the team strategy that makes it so they *can't* win a WS.  On
the other hand, it's definitely the case that the team is structured around
a plan for staying competitive year after year, as opposed to the boom and
bust pattern that some teams follow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Art Howe has moved on and Ken Macha is our new manager. This came as no
surprise to anyone. It was pretty much a foregone conclusion that Macha was
going to be a team manager somewhere. The smooth way in which it played out
suggests that the ownership had a pretty good idea it would be here. My
guess is that they gave Art the green light to see if he could find a
better offer, with the succession plan already in place in case he did.
Among other things, this would explain why the A's had been fairly stingy
about letting Macha interview elsewhere, even at the beginning of this
season. That's not the typical style for this team, so it seems probable
that they had something like this in mind even then.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also no surprise was trading away Cory Lidle, though it was moderately
interesting that it happened sooner rather than later. This move was
entirely about money. The minor-leaguers we got in exchange are OK, but not
even close to equal value. The problem was that the A's just had too much
money sunk into top-rank pitchers. Even with the remaining three we're
still at the top of the league in terms of starting pitching. Lidle had an
ERA of zero in the month of August, for chrissake, with almost 30 innings
pitched, but he was still our *fourth* pitcher. That's just crazy. Not that
there's anything wrong with having an abundance of good pitching, of
course, but Lidle was due to make $4 million this next year, and we've got
plenty of more important places we need to put that money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That he went to Toronto is no coincidence. You're going to continue to see
lots of trades between Toronto and Oakland; last year's Koch-Hinske deal
was just the beginning. J.P. Ricciardi was Billy Beane's top assistant
before he took over as Toronto's GM last year. They know each other well,
and they think alike.  Ricciardi was key in getting Lidle from Devil Rays
two years ago, so it's only natural that he take an interest him for the
new team which he's trying to build more or less along the Oakland pattern.
I think you'll see the A's team-building strategy slowly spread around the
league through its disciples, sort of like you saw with coaching in the NFL
in the Bill Walsh era. Beane's current right-hand man, Paul DiPodesta, will
probably be a GM somewhere in 2004. (Hopefully not here, though if Beane
does leave, I certainly hope he doesn't take DiPo with him.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The main thing the A's will be looking for with the $4 million they freed
up is an outfielder with a big bat. I never did hear the final word on
Justice, but I assume he retired as planned (and even if not, he wasn't
going to be a regular starter). That means we've got an open spot in the
outfield. My guess is that they'd prefer to get a CF and move Long to LF.
No one wants to openly say that the attempt to turn Long into a CF failed,
and he shows sparks just often enough to keep hope alive, but it's pretty
much tacitly understood by all that he just doesn't have those CF
instincts, and he plays better in LF.  But I don't know who they'll be able
to get, so if a good LF becomes available, maybe Long stays in CF another
year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Incidentally, can you believe that Randy Wynn went to the Mariners?  With
so many teams dying for a decent CF, and the prize one goes to a team that
doesn't really need it. Will they hang on to Cameron and Wynn both?  If it
were the A's you could be sure that one of them would be dealt back out,
but with other teams, I don't know.  Minnesota had *four* players who could
reasonably play CF as a starter, so go figure. (This year around the trade
deadline I was thoroughly expecting the A's to trade Minnesota a starting
pitcher (probably Harang, or possibly Lidle) in exchange for Bobby Kielty.)
I never did hear about Torii Hunter. Were the Twins able to hold on to him?
If not, I suppose Kielty is the natural choice to take his place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other spots on the A's team potentially open are 1B and C. Hatteberg is
re-signed, but he's not a shoo-in to start the season as 1B. I think we're
comfortable with him there, but if an upgrade is possible, that's fine,
too. No one is a lock at 2B either, but there are enough guys in the system
at the AAA level for that spot that I don't think we want to block their
path.  I think the team is happy keeping Ellis at 2B for now, and (although
they won't say so) I think the tentative plan is for Ellis to move over to
SS after we lose Tejada. Ray Durham hasn't been traded yet, but he's as
good as gone. He has stated what he wants in terms of salary and playing
time, and it's not something that the A's are prepared to offer. Some other
team will; it's just a matter of time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our backup catcher, Greg Myers, wasn't re-signed, which is interesting.
Myers is old enough that he may well be back anyway if no one else wants
him. What's interesting is that the A's have opened the door to getting a
starting-quality catcher to compete with Ramon Hernandez for the spot.
Hernandez gets a ton of criticism from the lesser-informed because they
only look at his stats, which aren't good. What generally doesn't get taken
into account is that he is deeply involved in calling the game and he has
been a significant part of Oakland's pitching success. (Which is to say,
he's the exact opposite of Pudge Rodriguez, who has fantastic stats but is
a contributing factor to Texas's lousy pitching.) In addition, Ramon is
unusually durable, he's been working with our three main starters all
through their times in the minor leagues, and Hudson is notoriously
difficult to catch, and you can see why the A's have been willing to
tolerate Ramon's subpar offense. The message that's going out now is that
the A's want to have it both ways (which is not unprecedented; consider
Posada, for example), whether that means finding a better hitter who can
run a game as well as Ramon does or else getting more offense out of Ramon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Along with Myers, another bench guy not re-signed was Olmedo Saenz.  That's
no big surprise, since he's sort of past his prime, but it raises an
interesting question. One of the key factors in the A's success was its
attitude toward filling the bench.  On a lot of teams, it's just assumed
that you get as many good hitters as you can, and the ones who are second
best end up on the bench. That doesn't quite work because most players hit
better when they can play every day, and a many players get fussy if they
think they're of starting quality and don't get to start. Platooning
doesn't always solve the problem because it frequently just leaves both
players without the advantage of being a starter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The A's took a different tack. Instead of just looking for good hitters,
they looked specifically for players who would play well even in a
situation where they are only coming off the bench. The reasoning is that
you have to have someone on the bench, and if you've got two players in the
same position who are only at their best when starting, then one of them is
going to waste - and if there's a prime directive in the A's organization,
it's that talent is never allowed to go to waste. If there is untapped
potential in our system, we figure out who needs it most and we shop it
off; if there's untapped potential in someone else's system, we go try to
get it - either for ourselves, or as a catalyst in a three-way trade. (The
Jeff Weaver deal was a classic Billy Beane arbitrage. There was no way in
hell we were going to keep him, but we made a tidy profit shopping him off
to someone else.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It so happens that there are those rare players who can go a week without
playing and then still come off the bench and hit something like .275. We
had three of them last year. Saenz we've had for several years, and he's
always been better as a pinch-hitter than as a starter. The other two were
Myers and Mabry, both of whom we sought out precisely for this quality.
Mabry came in the trade for Jeremy Giambi, who plays essentially the exact
same positions.  As a starter, Jeremy's stats are slightly better than
Mabry's, but as a bench player he was bad.  We knew that once Dye's injury
healed we wouldn't have a starting spot for Jeremy any more. That's what
motivated the trade.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The one thing that you're NOT hearing anyone say around Oakland, but which
is true nevertheless, is that Miguel Tejada will not be re-signed after his
contract runs out at the end of next season. In interviews, both sides are
talking a good game about how they hope to make it work out because it's
important for the team blah blah blah. Maybe they even believe it, but it's
not going to happen.  In one of the interviews, somebody said something
like "we don't want to make the same mistake we made with Jason Giambi last
year" - and there's the rub.  The deal with Jason Giambi was no mistake at
all. Sure, a lot of tears were shed seeing the team favorite go, and it'll
be the same with Tejada, but the bottom line is that it was the right move
made for the right reasons and, to top it all off, the move *worked*.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Letting go of Jason Giambi was a complete success.  Casual observers were
all saying how the A's would fall apart without their star. (I, you may
recall, said that the sans-Giambi team was "about as good as last year",
which turned out to be almost exactly the case.)  This team is built on
grooming young talent and shopping for value. Part of that strategy is to
grab stars while they're still young and underpriced and sign them for
long-term deals, but it is decidedly not part of the strategy to hang on to
a player once he can command a superstar wage.  If Jason Giambi were
willing to play in Oakland for half of what he could be paid elsewhere,
then sure we would have kept him, but it's just not in our budget to pay
his market value once he reaches all-star stature. Equally important, we
were not willing to give him a no-trade clause.  Giambi himself says this
was the deal-breaker, and I believe him.  It's one thing for the A's to
sign a superstar for big money, but know that they can still shop him
around when it makes sense to do so. It's quite another to commit to big
money and then be stuck with it for years to come no matter what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When Tejada's turn comes along, it will be the exact same story.  We will
offer him a generous one-year deal, and we'll offer him a reasonable
multi-year deal without a no-trade clause, but if he's looking for more
than that - as well he might - we simply won't match the offers he will
surely get from other teams. If he decides he'd rather play elsewhere and
get a better deal, we'll all say congratulations and we'll miss you, but
it's time for you to move on.  The fans will cry, and many will say that
the team can't survive without him, but the A's will stay competitive,
precisely because they continue to use their money smartly.

<i>((You're absolutely right here, the Red Sox are now starting to join
that style, at least partly.
Though it will take years since we're still stuck with contracts like
Manny Ramirez's.
The balancing act of starters and bench players was shown to the Red Sox big time
in the last few years, especially in 2001 when it was a primary reason for them
losing.
I hope they manage it better next year, since we picked up Jeremy Giambi, perhaps
not unless he actually starts.
But then, when you look at the szine quickly, see what happens....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark D. Lew (30 Nov 2002 21:42:26 -0800)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hey, I'm actually reading a <i>TAP</i> promptly for a change.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's: I was not surprised by Rick Desper's observation that the Red Sox had a
better record vs the AL than the A's did.  Interleague play is a huge
blessing for the A's. For whatever reason, we always clobber the NL teams.
This year we were 12-0 against the NL Central. Our only losses to the NL
were two against the Giants, and even against them we won both series. It's
not just against the easy teams; we do well against good NL teams, too. In
the 2001 season I remember we went 3-0 against the Diamondbacks, including
back-to-back shutouts right before the all-star break. In the entire
history of interleague play, the A's record against the NL is something
obscene like 75%.  Subtract the interleague play and I don't think the A's
make the playoffs any of the past three years.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And precisely the reverse is true for the Red Sox, let's see what happens
with the scheduling changes this year.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Iraq: I remain undecided about whether it is good policy to go to war with Iraq.
I do think that all of the good reasons to do so are geopolitical, and not
the moral ones that are frequently bandied about. The administration has
been less dishonest about this than one might expect, if you just read
between the lines. Although everything is being coated with a sort of
righteous moral propaganda, it's not an all-out deceit. The real reasons
are right there standing behind all the slogans. We say that it is
unacceptable for Iraq to have nuclear weapons, and that is essentially
true. We say that we want to promote democracy in Iraq, and that is
essentially true.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You, too, mention democracy. I think it's worth pointing out that this is a
tricky term that can mean several things.  
<i>((I know, I actually was talking about democracy, equality of women,
and at least a toning down of cultural imperialism, but there are other
definitions.))</i>
Literally it means rule of the
people. More often, in American usage, it's synonymous with the whole
collection of Western political values, some of which aren't literally
democratic at all (eg, property rights, freedom of speech). When we say
that we want democracy in the Middle East, what we mean is that we want a
Western style regime.  Note the change from past policy: We want not just a
pro-Western regime, which was always sufficient during the Cold War, but a
regime which is itself Western, so that the country is politically modeled
on America and politically aligned with it. In a sense (and certainly in
the minds of many) there is no such thing as a "democracy" which is not
politically aligned with the United States.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is essentially colonialism, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. One
can make a reasonable argument that the American/Western way really is the
best way and therefore now that we have the power to do it, we ought to
impose our system on other countries whether they like it or not, and in
the long run it will be in their best interest. For many years, such an
imperial argument was verboten, but it has become respectable again. Policy
wonks are saying it openly, and pointing to Japan and Germany as examples.
Once one suppresses the liberal reflex that gags on anything so
imperialistic, it's a convincing argument.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is what they're really talking about when they discuss bringing
democracy to the Middle East. How close it aligns with democracy in the
dictionary sense of the word is something which remains to be seen. It
might be more democratic, or it might be less democratic, but I don't think
that's the heart of the United States's political interest. If, for
example, a post-Saddam Iraq democratically chose a political direction
which was aggressively non-aligned, favoring strengthening the nation over
economic participation in the international community (say, like Peron's
Argentina, or even De Gaulle's France) I don't think that would be
acceptable to America's political interest.  If a democratic Iraq still
sought to be a regional superpower with a strong military (which I believe
it very well might) I'm certain that would not be acceptable to America's
political interest.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also don't think that America would easily accept a regime which doesn't
cloak itself in Western language and customs, regardless of whether the
regime is fundamentally democratic in its own non-Western way. We saw how
America responds to that sort of democracy in 1991-92 in Algeria (which I
continue to believe was a grave and profound error in our foreign policy),
and I see no evidence that Bush the son is any different from Bush the
father on this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another stated concern of both the president and of you is that Iraq not be
allowed to have nuclear weapons. This seems obvious enough on the face, but
it invites scrutiny. It is acceptable for China to have nuclear weapons. It
is acceptable for Israel to have nuclear weapons. It is acceptable for
France to have nuclear weapons. It is acceptable for Pakistan to have
nuclear weapons. Yet it is not acceptable for Iraq to have nuclear weapons.
Either this is a completely new direction in U.S. foreign policy, or Iraq
is a special case. I believe it is both.
<i>((Yes, I agree, you are explaining it better than I did.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why does Iraq want a nuclear weapon anyway?  If one buys into the
implication of the rhetoric, one might easily imagine that Saddam is trying
to nuke the United States or to blow up the whole world. That is probably
what a majority of the American public believes, but that's not at all
credible. Saddam wants a nuclear weapon for the same reason that every
aggressive nation wants a nuclear weapon - because it carries a great deal
of military clout. Saddam wants Iraq to be a regional superpower in the
Middle East. He wants to lord over Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states
just as China could lord over southeast Asia, Russia could lord over
Eastern Europe, and the United States could lord over the Caribbean. He
wants to have a credible deterrent as insurance against domination by his
rival state Iran, just as America and the Soviet Union wanted it against
one another, France wanted its own separate clout independent from the rest
of NATO, China wanted it against Russia, India wanted it against China, and
Pakistan wanted it against India.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One might argue that it is always a good thing to prevent the nuclear club
from getting any larger, no matter who the applicant may be. Surely that's
true, but it fails to explain the fact that the United States never
contemplated going to war against Israel, nor South Africa, nor India, nor
Pakistan. It still remains to be explained why Iraq is different.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One thing that the administration has been very clear about is that this is
not just about policing the world or having an active foreign policy.
Rather, he says, it is a fundamental matter of national security. This
statement is highly instructive. The common inference, no doubt encouraged
by the propagandists, is that Iraq poses a military threat to American
soil, but this is not credible. If Iraq poses no military threat to the
United States, why is it a fundamental matter of national security to us?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is the rub. The administration is stating - somewhat cryptically,
but openly nevertheless - that it is fundamental to our national interest
that Iraq not be allowed to be a regional superpower in the Middle East.
Whether it is ruled by Saddam or by someone else, and whether the clout is
gained through nuclear weapons or a more conventional military, Iraq cannot
be allowed to have the military strength to dominate its neighbors. That's
what stopping the invasion of Kuwait was all about, and that's what
American military presence in Saudi Arabia is all about.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In 1991 we went to war because Iraq invaded Kuwait. That seems normal
enough:  We always go to war if one nation invades another, right? In fact,
we don't. Throughout much of the 1990s Rwandan troops occupied a portion of
Zaire larger than Rwanda itself, but not only did America not lift a finger
to intervene, but hardly anyone in America even noticed. If a small and
undemocratic nation like Kuwait gets invaded, why should we care?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The reason, of course, is oil.  Once the topic of oil is raised, the
argument often gets redirected to familiar political ground: the liberals
make it an anti-corporate complaint, accusing the government of going to
war for the sake of "big oil", and the conservatives respond by dismissing
the liberal argument altogether. The truth is it surely is about oil, but
it's not just for the CEOs in big corporations; it's for the entire
country. Like it or not, oil is an enormous economic resource which our
modern society depends on. And like it or not, the largest portion of that
economic resource sits in the region of the world around the Persian Gulf.
<i>((And we cannot let some single country EVER control it all....
but the question remains how close is Iraq and Saddam to anything close
to this sort of power?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hence our fundamental national interest.  Regardless of whether the leader
is Saddam Hussein or someone else, regardless of whether the regime is
democratic or totalitarian, regardless of who may or may not support
terrorist attacks against the United States, regardless of Islam and any of
its varieties, Iraq is a nation which is well-positioned to take command of
that economic resource.  It is a profoundly powerful position.  In spite of
a corrupt and dictatorial regime, in spite of a protracted and bloody war
with its neighbor, in spite of an overwhelming bombing attack and invasion
by a global superpower, and in spite of several years of economic sanctions
from the international community - any one of which would have bankrupted
a lesser nation - Iraq still remains economically strong enough to
threaten its neighbors and possibly even develop high-technology weapons.
That it can do so it a testament to the powerful position it holds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Iraq and its environs is, in fact, the single most geopolitically important
region on the entire globe.  Any nation which wants to hold power in the
world must control such a region. The leaders of the United States
understand this, and that is why they want to declare war on Iraq.

<i>((Let me finish up this section with a little 2003 local college
basketball preview.
I'll start with the semi-local women's team across the border in Storrs.
Unfortunately, it looks like MY new favorite UConn Husky, Nicole Wolff,
has a stress fracture in her foot and will be out for much of the Big
East season, this is a bad trend where my favorite Husky always tends
to be injury prone!
But maybe Nicole will be back for the NCAA's and the Taurasi and young
kids team is still doing great so far.
They play Tennessee on Jan. 4th (which is after I type this, but happened
before you read it).
I'll still think that UConn can challenge Duke for the Championship
until proven otherwise.
The men's RI teams are extremely surprising and I look forward to 
exciting seasons.
Jim Baron came in from St. Bonaventure to start building the URI team
right, not the dodgy ways that the last couple of good teams had been built.
The URI team is amazingly tough on defense and unselfish.
In a very poor Atlantic 10 league, they could challenge for a Division or
even League title - I don't think I'm overextending here, watch for it.
The PC team has been very up and down, with lots of injuries, but on the
eve of the Big East season is coming together with a brilliant freshman
point guard Donnie McGrath, who is going to be a real solid star.
With Romuald Augustin getting back in shape after missing a whole year from
injuries, and some improving returnees
(led by 20 point, 10 rebound banger Ryan Gomes), I think PC can challenge for an
NCAA berth.  
Like UConn, look for PC's first big game - against Boston College at BC
this week - for a hint of what the season will look like.
PC already almost beat Alabama in Alabama.
The crowd and the officials and the pressure left them just short, but
that will serve them well later.
I'm very optimistic, so it looks like a fun season around here!
Other thoughts from other locales always welcome....))</i>

You told me useful things, what people think of me, I guess I should thank you.

Especially, contact Rip Gooch for Railway Rivals as the following maps 
are available. 
Following each in parenthesis is the suggested number of players: 
Isle of Wight (3 or 4); Netherlands (3 or 4); Northern Italy Map P (4 to 8);
Spain Map SP (4 to 7); China Mk. I (6 to 8); Austria (3 or 4);
Belgium and Luxembourg (3 or 4); Southern Italy Map Q (4);

Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly.
You also can sign up for the next Breaking Away game, which is starting now.
Tom Howell currently is signed up, knock off the superstar, come on,
you can do it!!
So far, Eric Brosius wants to challenge Tom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Harold Reynolds is willing to start a game of Colonia and one of Aberration.
I think the signup list for Colonia includes me, David Hood, Paul Rauterberg,
David Partridge, and (Yes, really!!) Konrad Baumeister.
That means we only need four more.
In the meantime, Konrad, Paul, and David are playing a "demo game".
I'll try to get a web address for it in here next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper and Kurt Ozog are the only ones signed up for that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The Concession to the Fool and the TIRE
draw are both rejected, I guess you haven't TIREd of this game yet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(R - &gt;  BOARD): The mailbox is empty...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): Interestingly, the rest of the crowd is NOT empty....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARON to THE UNITED NATIONS): I will concede that Dan
is a fool, but I will not concede to the Fool. I will
also not concede to those who TIRE of the game,
because I can not conceive how a game without press or
negotiations can possibly tire anyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SILENT SULTAN to HAL9000): How come you never drop in for tea?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HAL2002 to SILENT SULTAN): First of all, I ***did*** stop in, but
you weren't there!
And besides, you have my model number wrong, so you clearly haven't
been paying attention.
And of course, the America's Cup race is far more exciting than anything
I've seen in any Diplomacy game you've been involved with lately,
and that's as each match continues to be a blowout and we get closer
and closer to the unthinkable idea of a landlocked country as host.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARON to TOM RIDGE): In the face of Turkish
entrenchment, Russian intrigue, and Italian
indifference, Austria is preparing to institute its
own Homeland Security Bill. Please send advisors to
offer suggestions on legislation, early-warning
systems, snappy letterhead, cumbersome bureaucracy,
etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SILENT SULTAN to BABBLING BLURBIST): So, I've ignored you into submission
finally, eh?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE - GERMANY): Your nose is like a river: its always running.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE - ENGLAND): Your Diplomacy play reminds me of an onion: the deeper I
go the less there is, until I uncover nothing at the center.  You probably
are one of those people who take a bite out of each chocolate looking for
the "good" one.  I might even o so far as to suggest that you touch every
donut in the box with your grimy hands, licking your fingers after rejecting
each one.  I just pray you don't double-dip your chips.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SILENT SULTAN to FLIPPANT FOOL): Those fleets are a sign of love right,
loove like a bad '50s musical? Oh great ...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARON to DONALD RUMSFELD): As per your administration's
request, Austria amassed troops in Silesia and Bohemia
in preparation to sweep the border for Rote Armee
Faktion training camps. Then the Chechens blew up
Warsaw. Please send advisors to share intelligence on
all Chechen tactics, Chechnya force build-ups in St.
Petersburg, trillion-dollar anti-ballistic
boondoggles, etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CHICAGO to NEW ZEALAND): Are we there yet?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(NEW ZEALAND to CHICAGO): Bwa haha ... dream on

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARON to JOHN ASHCROFT): Thank you for all your advice
on right-wing demagoguery and war hysteria
manipulation. The World Media has been completely
cowed into silence. Please continue to send advisors
to help draft laws defining treason as voicing an
opinion, joining the ACLU, dining at ethnic
restaurants, etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE - AUSSIES): Is your name not Bruce?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to FRANCE): It seems there is a crack in the armor this turn,
even if you still were dislodged from Belgium.
And then there was the Fool.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE - GM): Go Mavericks.  
<i>((Seems like a fun team to root for!!!))</i>
Go New York Football Giants.  
<i>((I think they're in trouble against the 49ers....))</i>
And die a painful, slow and miserable death, Dallas Cowboys.

1) This year should be an important one for the game.
I know I'm wondering what comes next....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIAN MOSCOVIAN PRESS):  Would it not be more simpler to write Steve?  Must
I be kept guessing.  Merely sending me what I said some time back is not
telling me what you are to do.  So, a bit of a compromise, without a stab.
My units move back into Russia if you moved as I think you said you might
move if you said anything at all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed
and I still didn't have a chance
to do the final Endgame chart.
You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and 
is guest GMing a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next "big" game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, could Harold give me an exact count
of how many are signed up?
Also, Harold ran a test game with Konrad Baumeister, Dave Partridge
and Paul Rauterberg
that you could look at on his website.
See the note above about the Diplomacy A to Z, which also is there.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected.
There actually are no new proposals (which may or may not be on purpose
by players).
Any proposal for the Fall goes back to the "failure to vote automatically
vetoes the draw" rule as a result.
If this was not on purpose, by Spring we can go back to where we had been
on the draw proposals if I get asked to do it.
And clearly there is no interest in speeding up the game, so we'll stop
proposing that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Paul Kenny tells me about his wife Sandy: "The best e-mail address to use 
for Sandy is our temporary aol account, Kennyshire of aol.com.
I set her up with a net Net-gate account, but as far as I know she
hasn't used it, sakenny of net-gate.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) The NMR's continue, you have a while to get in Spring 1904 orders, but do it
NOW!!!!
Lee Kendter moves up to Austria; Jack McHugh becomes England; Sandy Kenny
moves across the Channel to France; Germany is the Schultz position;
Paul Rauterberg is in Italy; Karl Muller gets the four nuke Russian position;
and Harry Andruschak moves into the corner in Turkey.
Send me Spring orders for those countries right away or not....
it is your choice after all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY-ALL): No nukes, man!  Peace out.  We've taken a more-or-less
non-aggression stance this year (vague apologies to Jack) to let some
feuds clear.  Next year, game on (again)!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ALL): Remember that the "Yuppie" part of this game is supposed
to acknowledge that people are busy and might get bored or not have time
to submit orders.  As you all can see, this doesn't totally trash your
position.
You can come back and play any time you like.
In the current vernacular, this makes it a feature, not a bug!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper and Kurt Ozog are in to be two of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The Ukraine/Germany draw is rejected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "When we say we've had enough; We know we really 
want more."  From "Hate is the New Love", from <i>Oooh!</i>, the Mekons stellar
new CD, go out and get it NOW!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KLINGONS-STAR TREK PRESSES): Say what??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPANISH TRIBUNE): Summer 2010, Spanish Commander O'Donnell 20 years ago 
led the Spanish people into one war to another when will this conquest 
end? The million dollar question that has of yet isn't answered. The 
Spanish Generals currently are optimistic with this war's result. Spain 
overall is working with the combined nations against Ukraine in much the 
same way the United States has for the past forty years. Unfortunately the 
United States as of yet has not entered the war. The Americans seem to be 
enjoying their renewed policy of isolationism. The Spanish people seem to be 
overjoyed with the aiding program that has been set up during this campaign. 
Will peace come again in the near future. (In other news is anyone else 
aware that this war in real life time is taking as much time as a real war 
has?? Think about it, I was 17 four years ago. i.e. when this game started,)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPAIN-MEKONS): Sing it. Could we get another singer for press??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MEKONS to SPAIN): No.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPAIN-BOOB): You know what this game so far reminds me of? Would you believe 
a song and a commercial? Its the song that never ends some people started 
singing it not knowing what it was blah blah blah. For the commercial it 
would be the duracell it keeps going and going and going.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT-UKRAINE): Is it too late to be friends??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK): It's Christmas Eve, a Paramount studio executive
is asleep having a Star Trek dream.  In the first dream, he
goes back in time to the first Mars colony.
He is on the top of the highest Mars mountain, urinating on a rock.
Suddenly the dream changes and he is on Earth making love to 
Britney Spears.
This is a Star Trek dream because our sleeping executive is
going where no man has gone before.
Suddenly he is awakened by an angry smashing noise on his
front door (KNOCK, KNOCK).
He gets out of bed to see a large unshaven fat man dressed
in red standing on his front porch and he can clearly see,
this man is pissed.
He opens the door only to find himself in complete shock when
he realizes that the man on his porch in none other than
the one and the only; Gene Roddenberry dressed in a red
captain's uniform from Star Trek II.
The Paramount executive (PE) remembering a line that Khan used
in that movie, grabbed Gene (GR) by the throat, held him up
in the air, and asked, "Why are you here?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: We need to talk!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: Talk!
It's almost midnight, Christmas fricking Eve!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: I'm not leavin' until we talk!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: OK, talk!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: I thought I had complete control of the Star Trek program!
I want to know who authorized a Romulan episode not written by me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: You have to admit, it was a pretty good episode.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: That's not the point, I'm supposed to have complete control.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: You have complete control over what you write.
That doesn't mean we can't have an independent writer produce
a separate episode.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GE: You can't do that!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: Truthfully, Gene, we had to do it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GE: Why?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: Because lately the episodes you've been writing pretty much suck!
Your obsession with the Boston Red Sox is boring and the opening 
song to the new Enterprise series is an embarrassment.
<i>((That's for damned sure, it makes me unable to even watch the
show casually!!!
In this dialog the Gene/executive thing I find REALLY cool, captures
things perfectly!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GE: Well, you've got me there, but I only used that song because I
lost a bet.
I am not going to allow any more unauthorized Romulan or anything
else episodes.
If you run another one I'm going to sue the studio.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: You can't sue, you have no standing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: What do you mean?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: You're still dead, aren't you?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: You've got me there.
Maybe I could write a Star Trek Christmas Carol.
I could play the ghost of bad episodes past.
Now that Babylon 5 is done, I could get Commander Chekov
to play Tiny Tim and Worf could play Scrooge.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: Nice try, but Worf would probably end up killing
Tiny Tim in some brutal Klingon ritual.
By the way, how's Dr. McCoy?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: Still dead!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PE: Tell him to have a Merry Christmas!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GR: Merry Christmas!!

not a choir boy!"

(CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLEMENTAL): Our battle with the Romulans has
begun and it's not going well.
In a desperate attempt to keep additional Romulan forces out
of the Neutral Zone, I ordered Captain Sulu to abandon our
only Starbase on the Romulan side of the Neutral Zone to
engage the advancing enemy.
The Romulan commander anticipated my move by adding an 
additional warbird to the fight, forcing Sulu to withdraw
back into the now surrounded Starbase.
We have no hope of holding out and can only hope to continue
the fight while we withdraw and wait for Klingon reinforcements.
To make matters worse, the Romulans are mocking me in their
government controlled press.
Ever since I mistook a Romulan war cruiser for a troop transport,
almost causing the fall of the Federation to the Ferengi/Romulan
alliance, I have not gotten a lot of respect from the Empire.
Thank God for the Ferengi flipflop.
On the bright side, Mr. Spock has calculated that with the Klingon
reinforcements and the Federation, Cardassian, Klingon, and Bajoran
alliance should (if the alliances hold, a big if) eventually wear
down the Romulans.
I still feel bad about the Federation Council decision to attack
the Romulans.
I worked very well with their Commander.
