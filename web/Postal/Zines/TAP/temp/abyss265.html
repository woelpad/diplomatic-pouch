<br /><br />We have two issues of Michael Lowrey's subszine and one of David Partridge's in
this issue.
David notes a deadline of one week from today (probably not as you're going to be
getting this) of November 18th.
He can keep that deadline, or one near it and have his next issue go with my
next issue, or he can wait.
I'll leave that up to him, contact him if you are unsure of your game's status.
And there is NO sign of Don Williams.  
I haven't talked to him in some time.
He may be affected by some of the things that were affecting me....

<p>
<br /><br />  ``Everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it''
The Scarecrow, from the ``second'' Oz book, <i>The Land of Oz</i>,
being said to Mr.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Woggle-Bug T.&nbsp;E.&nbsp; (as in Highly Magnified
and Thoroughly Educated) who then when trying
to read the fine academic Ode he composed for Ozma's birthday
in the ``fifth'' Oz book, <i>The Road to Oz</i> the Scarecrow
basically tells the Woggle-Bug to ``stuff it'' at the planning
session for Ozma's party.
Though the Woggle-Bug does eventually deliver his Ode at
the party,
one might wonder who or what is unusual and what one does to 
that which is unusual once one is accustomed to it.
You also may wonder why I am suddenly resorting to quote from L.&nbsp;Frank
Baum's books, but as a longtime fan of Baum's I recently bought
a really neat biography of him by Katherine Rogers that I highly
recommend.
It likely will complete the resurrection of Baum as an author
worthy of attention that has been coming along for some decades now.
Most of you probably really only know the original Wizard of Oz movie,
but I actually have always liked <i>The Land of Oz</i> best that
tells where Ozma comes from.
You read it and tell me that it is not complex literature that has
a lot to say about our diverse society of today.
Can we embrace diversity or will it sink us?
That is the question of this century that Baum tackled a hundred years ago.

<p>
<br /><br />I know, I know, this was a LONG break.
I needed it from three perspectives that I want to briefly explain to you all,
despite the acknowledged ``lack of interest" in Szine Editors regaling you with
excuses why they were late.

<p>
First off, the one you all know.  If anyone ever tells you trouble or bad luck
comes in threes, tell them it comes in fours, at least in Diplomacy.  That
run of obituaries just became more than I could stand, and I couldn't stand
the idea of printing more of the comments and remembrances in this issue, 
so I haven't.  If anyone didn't
have what they wrote printed and wants to work it up into something for 
print and print it somewhere else, that's fine by me.
Also, I'm trying to finish up <i>Diplomacy World</i> and anything you want
to write more as an article also would be fantastic but we're done with
it here to go back to life, gaming, and fun.

<p>
Second, as I told you all, I bought a summer house in Maine, that I've also
been using this fall.
So far, the new toy has cut into szine editing time and I'm not sure what the
long run outcomes are, but the house is now shut up for the winter and I'm
back with more free time.
But this is a happy circumstance. 
And then the last weekend where I had lots of time to work on the szine I spent
playing Diplomacy at ``DavidCon'' in Boston with David Norman visiting from 
England.
We had a great time and got more people excited about coming to World DipCon
in February.
I have my plane tickets now, so I'm definitely going.  
You should be going too.
There are likely to be OVER 200 players this time, be one of them!!
The discounted entry fee of only $30 for World DipCon is available ONLY
until the end of November!
Those outside of North America get in entirely for free!
See all the info you need at: 

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/armada/2003/

<p>
And lastly, and perhaps most importantly to me and least importantly to you,
I've been getting blasted at work..... the government job part of my work.
Since the Republican administration came into office they have been diligently
trying to wrest control of the government bureaucracy from the bureaucrats.
Part of my job, only part, is essentially as a bureaucrat.
And it took awhile, but the Secretary and Deputy Secretary finally started
coming after me, at least by proxy.
The easiest way to put this in context is to note that this is what that
debate you've been hearing about for the Homeland Security Dept. (which would
NOT include me) is about.
The Republicans in the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (my agency) are trying to
take direct control of the over 100,000 personal services contracts in my
agency.
We're not sure if they actually want to manage them all, which would be
impossible, OR if they just want to control which types of contracts should
be allowed, OR if they actually want to encourage more of them to replace
more government employees with consultant and contracted services.
If it is the latter, this is backfiring in my agency as it has brought contracting
to a near halt.
Anyway, this is all terribly boring, but it has been consuming my energy and time
with writing contract justifications, etc.

<p>
This brings me to a brief commentary on Iraq (opposing views welcome)
that a couple of people in the szine have asked me to make.  I would
have said more or less the same thing a couple of months ago.....
though what I would have said has become more topical right this instant.
First of all, I get VERY conditional about what I think is adequate 
justification and intent to actually REALLY invade Iraq with a full 
frontal attack.  Some of that will become clear below.  I really like
that the President allowed Colin Powell to do his job and work out the
UN Resolution.  A few months ago, I would have said that the effort
was doomed without lots of Colin Powell's input.

<p>
And the key: Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons would be potentially REALLY
destabilizing, so something needed to be done before he got them.  The
question is (and intelligence on the issue is not public, shouldn't be
public, and may be wrong) when would/will he get them?  I'm NOT worried
about his chemical and biological stockpiles as many of them were destroyed
in the 1990's with the earlier inspection efforts and Saddam doesn't have
especially good delivery devices set up.  But I am worried about 
Saddam with nukes.
And even peacenik types should be as well.

<p>
So, let's assume that we have to trust our President and know he can't
tell all our secrets.  How do I think they came to have a ``perfect storm"
of policy events (the latest buzzword for the year) that led to near
unanimity in the Bush Administration?  Well, mainly it was that every
segment of the policy community had its issue and people could stand
with people who had reasons that differed from theirs, but with similar
aims.  What were some of those issues?  Nuclear weapons (which is ``my''
issue) certainly was one.  Other people were hung up on chemical and
biological weapons.  With smallpox, it is HIGHLY likely that the
vaccine, if widely deployed, will kill far more people than the disease
WOULD have killed with no vaccinations, even if Saddam tried to release it,
which I happen to think he won't do (his people likely would suffer the most).
Other people were focused on the idea of bringing REAL democracy to the
Middle East (I am also really sympathetic with this one, but highly
skeptical about the Bush Administration's ability to carry it out,
witness the current disaster in Afghanistan; BUT it could start
the ``domino effect'' that brings down repressive regimes that we
support in the Middle East; thus, I don't think that argument has
much general sway).  Yet others were worried 
about oil and the economy.  Some were worried about the ``Axis of Evil"
and international terrorism (not something I think Saddam actually is
very involved in).  And yet others were interested in reigning in 
other countries (read France and Russia) who were taking advantages of
the UN sanctions to secretly trade with Iraq at a profit.  

<p>
Colin Powell did a great job of working with the UN (where different
countries had different degrees of concern and trust in the US across
these issues, and I'm sure I've left some out - some people may actually
care about the Iraqi people!!!) to work through all of this to focus on
the step of weapons inspectors first.  As I finish this issue up, the 
Iraqi legislature is finishing up their obligatory unanimous vote against
the UN resolution.  Now the dealing with Saddam in earnest begins.  I hope
we don't rush to war, but go to war we must if we don't shut down the
growing nuclear capabilities.  Give it time, though, why be presumptive
unless we're really sure he's about to go nuclear?  I don't see that.

<p>
Interesting how the government works with all of these divided opinions,
interests, and loyalties.  There was something of a perfect storm that 
brought all of this together (I'm not the only one to say this of course),
but what I would emphasize is that the future is murky for the Bush Administration
with those deep divisions, especially if the interests in the various 
driving force issues diverge as we go forward from here.

<p>
I wish we were truly interested in nation building.  It would be good for
our economy, our world standing, and for the only thing that will really
stop terrorism - development of real trans-nation world communities,
based on citizenship and democratic principles.
I worry that when the other interests I mention are dealt with, just
as they were with much lower stakes in Afghanistan, the US will back away.
And we won't start a deluge of democracy in the region that has a chance
to free even more countries from oppression.

<p>
But enough sermonizing.  The tough stuff REALLY is to come.  Let's see
if the Bush Administration (and the diverse individuals in it) have
the stomach for it.

<p>

<b>2002 HOBBY AWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
The new announcement for this year is the institution of a new award. 
We are going to call it the Kathy Byrne Caruso Lifetime Achievement 
Award and unlike the other awards it is going to be awarded by the 
Committee –- you know, like in the Academy Awards – but all of you 
are eligible to nominate people for it each year. This award is being 
named in loving memory of one of the greatest player personalities the 
game has ever seen, who also happens to be a woman. Kathy Byrne Caruso 
died in August 2002 from complications in her battle with lung cancer. 
In issues #263 and #264 of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>, you can see 
her picture (http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/tapfp264.pdf)
and remembrances of her and her career. The qualifications 
for the Kathy Byrne Caruso Lifetime Achievement Award are that the 
awardee must have been: (1) Active in the Diplomacy Hobby in at least 
Three Separate Decades; (2) Multidimensional in their Contributions to 
the Hobby (e.g. writing, playing, publishing); (3) Taking Retirement or 
Semi-Retirement from the Diplomacy Hobby; and (4) One of the Hobby’s 
Unique Personalities Worthy of Being Remembered as Long as THE Game 
Continues to be Played. Now to the awards: thanks to all of the nominees,
even though who did not win received plenty of support from the more than 
75 voters. I still hope that we can have even more participation next year. 
Thanks as well to those who contributed money toward the plaques that all 
of the winners will be receiving in the mail soon. Recall that you can 
look at all of the nominees and the entire Ballot on the web:

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/BALLOT02.html

<p>
And now to this new special lifetime achievement award and all of 
this year’s awards (note that there were TWO ties and that those 
two awards each are being awarded in duplicate!):

<p>
<br /><b>The 2002 Kathy Byrne Caruso Award for Lifetime Achievement is awarded to 
Richard Sharp</b>

<p>
There cannot be a more appropriate winner of the first award, especially 
in light of the worldwide expansion of the scope of the hobby and the Hobby 
Awards, than Richard Sharp. Richard’s szine <i>Dolchstoss</i> began thirty years 
ago and has been a workhorse of the British Diplomacy Hobby, until recently 
being in semi-suspension due to Richard’s own battles with cancer. Luckily, 
I hear from him that he is doing better lately and we hope he is with us for 
many years longer. Richard also has produced one of the great books on the 
strategy and tactics of Diplomacy, <i>The Game of Diplomacy</i>
(http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/god.htm), which is still 
widely consulted on the Web today by novice and experienced players alike. 
Richard’s letter columns and commentaries also always have a great deal 
of bite to them as he comments on events from a conservative point of view. 
For more detail on all of this, my interview with Richard for 
<i>Diplomacy World</i> fleshes all of this out in much greater detail:

<p>
http://www.diplomacyworld.org/issues/issue88/88interview4.htm

<p>
<br /><b>The Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service is awarded to Chad Schroeder</b>

<p>
Chad is the founder and webmaster of the Redscape site 
(http://www.redscape.com) for the play of 
Diplomacy. The Redscape site started up in 
1998 with just Chad and one other volunteer hosting games by hand. 
It then added a Redscape Forum structure in 2000 that allowed any 
member to host a game for the community. There are currently 68 games 
of Diplomacy being played and around 220 games concluded since the site 
inception. There are 1767 registered profiles, but Chad estimates around 
400 members are active at any one time. Chad currently is working on a 
major redesign of the site, but this award shows how people already 
value what he has created to date. It seems to me as an observer that 
games fill with enthusiasm and with lightning quickness as Chad has 
built a great Internet Diplomacy gaming community.

<p>
<br /><b>A 2002 Rod Walker Award for Literary Achievement is awarded to Glenn 
Ledder</b>

<p>
Glenn is receiving this award for his article on Stable Two-Way Draws 
in Standard Diplomacy, which appeared in the Spring 2001 Movement 
Issue of The Diplomatic Pouch:

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/S2001M/Ledder/TwoWayDraws.html

<p>
Note that in the original ballot this article was listed as a joint authored
article between Glenn and Karlis Povisils. After nominations, I was informed 
that the article is Part I of an intended two part article on this subject 
where Part I was authored solely by Glenn Ledder. Karlis informs me that 
he is working diligently on the Part II article now and we all hope to see 
that in print as well soon. Glenn’s article addresses a subject that the 
voters clearly want to hear more about -– advice on how to deal with the 
endgame in Diplomacy - where mistakes, as Glenn notes to me, are 
irredeemable.

<p>
<br /><b>A 2002 Rod Walker Award for Literary Achievement is awarded to Joe Brennan</b>

<p>
Joe is receiving this award for his article on How to Solo, which appeared 
in the Fall 2001 Movement Issue of The Diplomatic Pouch:

<p>
http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/F2001M/Brennan/HowToSolo.html

<p>
Note that this article also deals with the endgame and provides 
loads of practical advice on this perhaps most important endgame 
strategy from a player who has pulled off lots of solos. This award 
also is richly deserved for someone relatively new to the writing 
ranks (he only wrote What is a Newbie 
http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/F2000M/Brennan/Newbie.html) and came 
off that designation just two years ago), but with lots of future potential.

<p>
<br /><b>A 2002 John Koning Award for Player Performance is awarded to Cyrille Sevin</b>

<p>
Cyrille is receiving this award for winning World DipCon XI in Paris 
last summer to become the first Two-Time World DipCon Champion
(http://devel.diplom.org/Face/results/zWDC2001.html). This 
continues a trend where the voters are putting a great deal of emphasis 
on successful FTF Tournament play and the Paris World DipCon arguably has 
the deepest and best roster of any tournament in the last five years. See 
Edi Birsan’s commentary on how Cyrille won in <i>Diplomacy World</i>:

<p>
http://www.diplomacyworld.org/issues/issue88/88voting_at_an_end.htm 

<p>
Today, Cyrille actively is trying to improve his play-by-E-Mail skills.

<p>
<br /><b>A 2002 John Koning Award for Player Performance is awarded to Brian Dennehy</b>

<p>
Brian is receiving this award for his play in a wide variety of forums, 
including finishing with the most total points at World DipCon XI in Paris 
(http://devel.diplom.org/Face/results/zWDC2001.html)
last summer and losing the overall championship in the tie-breaker 
with Cyrille Sevin:

<p>
http://www.diplomacyworld.org/issues/issue88/88first_is_the_worst.htm 

<p>
One could have hoped that the voting could have 
provided another answer to that Final Board tie and in a sense it did. 
Brian also won E-Mail games in 2001 where he has been proficient as well.

<p>
<br /><b>The Fred Hyatt Award for GM Performance is awarded to Tom Reinecker</b>

<p>
Tom is a GM at Redscape (http://www.redscape.com), the Diplomacy gaming 
community started by Chad Schroeder, who won this year’s Don Miller Award. 
Like last year’s Fred Hyatt Award winner, Doug Burgoyne, Tom Reinecker 
is the GM of a very large world variant of his own design that he GM’s by 
hand. WW IV (http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/ww4map-ver31.jpg), 
depending on the version, has either 29 or 30 players. The latest game opening 
by Tom for this variant, that was opened recently on Redscape, 
filled in a day and a half. This is direct market testimony to how 
players think about Tom’s GM performance. You can become a member 
of Redscape and join new versions of this large variant.

<p>
<br /> Thanks to all of those who contributed money toward the plaques for the awards. 
The donations were especially generous this year. After the award plaques are 
produced and mailed an accounting of the expenses will be available from me 
or the Treasurer, Fred Davis. The Committee currently consists of myself 
(Chair), Fred Davis (Treasurer), Gary Behnen, Melinda Holley, Jamie Dreier, 
Paul Kenny, Mark Stretch, and Robert Lesco. Thanks to all who voted and made 
these awards the success that they have been. There were over 75 of you for 
the second consecutive year from all over the world and the hobby. And winners

<br /><br />And now I finally get to the usual header stuff.
I decided to can the sub price increase, the postal rate increase
really is peanuts, or it seems so at the 3-5 ounce level that I live it.
So, no problem, let's keep selling subs when I can at this price.
You all know that I'm an incredible softie anyway.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:

<p>
David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
The future of the League of course is a bit up in the air, though
it looks like we will have another season.
John still has openings!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us.

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a ``whenever''.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ED HENRY</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>

<p>
Find him and win the fifty buck prize!!
You have until Issue number 270 to find him.
I want to tell Ed about Kathy and all sorts of other things.
No one found Berry Renken, so he goes into the backlog pile.
There is a ``full board'' there now, help me out and earn
yourself some cash!!!
Ed Henry was very active in the hobby in the 1980's.
I don't think he's the same Ed Henry who's so famous right now working
on Kiplinger's magazine (writes the Car reviews and is African American),
but he could be.
Ask him and find out!

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Berry, Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Berry Renken or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<p>
WorldMasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals Completed!!

<p>
CONGRATULATIONS to WorldMasters 200 Champion Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu!!!

<p>
This is possibly the most prestigious and hard fought E-Mail
tournament around (only challenged by Doug Massey's Vermont
Group Tournaments or the Australian E-Mail Tournament), now
with FOUR full rounds.
The final players (with final SC standing, which is what
counts in a C-Diplo based tournament) are:

<p>
AUSTRIA: Jack Brawner - Find Jack at TrojanOwl of aol.com,
stabbed viciously at the end, handing the sure win to 
Joe and ended up with 5 centers in 1912.

<p>
ENGLAND: Mike Weinzimer - Find Mike at mweinzimer of yahoo.com, 
and he continues his yo-yoing at the end and ended up back
DOWN at 2 centers in 1912

<p>
FRANCE: Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu - Find Joe at janbu of online.no,
and his final surge was the wildly successful one as he won 
the C-Diplo SC based scoring for the final round with 10
centers in 1912 and the WorldMasters Championship!

<p>
GERMANY: Douglas Vaughan - Find Douglas at vaughan4 of mindspring.com,
and after his surge to seven he collapsed down to 5 centers, where
he ended 1912.

<p>
ITALY: Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira - You can find Egg at egbert of salavip.com.br,
and he was eliminated at the end of 1907, poor, poor Egg....

<p>
RUSSIA: Darren Koch - You can find the Aussie Darren at koch_family of bigpond.com,
and he still was holding strong at 7 centers at the end of 1912, but
that was NOT enough.

<p>
TURKEY: Frank Johansen - Find Frank at frank.johansen of diplomacy.no,
and he ended 1912 back down to 5 centers as his last attack collapsed.

<p>
The wondrous Peter Richardson pjrich of ntlworld.com was the GM.

<p>
Hey, Jim, you should have come to Tempest in a Teapot IV near Washington 
last weekend; you would have enjoyed it.  Rick Desper will probably have 
a few notes and Andy Marshall sent out the full standings and award 
winners today.

<p>
There were about 45 people, up to 42 at a time so we had six boards 
Friday night, six boards Saturday, and five boards Sunday.  There were 
two variants Saturday night (Double Secret Diplomacy where six players 
each run two countries out of twelve on a 59-dot variant map, and Payola 
Diplomacy where you can bribe other players' units).  Also a few side 
games:  vanilla Settlers, Munchkin, and (the only game I learned there) 
Plague &amp; Pestilence.  Others played at least a half-dozen other games. 
I saw a lot of old friends, and made a couple of new ones.

<p>
I got one board-topping result, a ten-center France in a three-way draw, 
but got eliminated twice, so I finished 20th of 45 players, 39 of whom 
played at least two rounds.  Even that draw looked like I would be the 
first or second power eliminated, as I was reduced to 3 centers in 
Winter '02.  But an R/T formed just to end the slow-to-resolve game, and 
as F/G/A/I went to stop the Steamroller, I was able to grab several dots 
in a couple of years to reach the high end of a 10-9-8-4-1-1-1 split. 
R/T wanted a three-way with a western power, and the little guys' eyes 
lit up when I mentioned survival points (one point per center if you're 
out of a voted draw)... so the vote passed.  If the scoring system were 
C-Diplo, I would have been in glory.

<p>
One full board, seven people, came from the PiggyBack Diplomacy Society 
in Oregon:

<p>
 (see www.piggybackdip.org)  

<p>
Most are from either Eugene or 
Portland areas.  They led the alcohol-consumption statistic.  I noted, 
``When you don't have Irish Dip players, you call the Piggybackers to 
fill their role."

<p>
My car made the DC run quite successfully, getting 30 mpg on the 
highway.  The mileage was much worse in the city Thursday night when I 
drove downtown, looked around the Capitol building, and stopped at the 
Washington Monument (too late in the day to climb it).  Traffic was slow 
enough to dissuade me from doing that again.  But I'm glad I did it for 
the first time since I was a little kid, except the little bit we did 
one night in '82 at a CloneCon held as a satellite to Origins/DipCon at 
UMBC.

<p>
Kudos to Conrad Woodring who won the tournament and led Team Woodring 
(his father and brother) to the Saturday team title.  And mad props to 
Andy for running a fine tournament, to his wife Martha for a Thursday 
night party and general support, and to Andy Bartalone for hours of 
shuttling people from airports.  I enjoyed the event and I recommend 
next year's DipCon there.

Dear friends, fellow dippers,

<p>
We are proud to announce the foundation of the Deutscher Diplomacy Bund, the
german diplomacy association. For the first time, the german hobby has one
body to represent all of us and to coordinate our projects and efforts.

<p>
Members of the two largest german player communities, Ludomaniac and
Lepanto/DEAC and a number of independents; founded the DDB last
saturday at the german FTF championships. The association will be registered
as a non-profit organization under german law soon. The members have elected
a board consisting of:

<p>
André Illievics, president, andre of diplomacy-bund.de

<p>
Sascha Hingst, vice-president, sascha of diplomacy-bund.de

<p>
Jan Baier, treasurer, Jan of diplomacy-bund.de

<p>
Bernd Wittman, Bernd of diplomacy-bund.de

<p>
Frank Hassenpflug, Frank of diplomacy-bund.de

<p>
The DDB will seek membership in international diplomacy bodies such as the
EDA soon.

<p>
We will also maintain a fund to help people with less money to travel to dip
events, very alike the one founded by Edi and Larry. Difference will be that
we do not limit the german fund exclusivly to germans (details another time)

<p>
If you have any questions concerning our association, if you look for
official contacts, or if you want our cooperation for any brilliant or crazy
projects, please contact:
Sascha Hingst,
Silbershohl 18,

Tel: 49 171 416 82 54;
Email:  sascha of diplomacy-bund.de 
or sahib3000 of aol.com; any of the other board members. 

<p>
For a long time you have seen or heard little of diplomacy in Germany, few
germans came to the dipcons, few foreigners traveled here. We believe it´s
time to change that (or, to steal a quote:) stab you soon!

Red Dragon vs. Manhunter</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Some have complained that Red Dragon is not as good as Michael
Mann's Manhunter.  Others have complained that neither is as good
as the original book.  This reviewer cannot comment upon the latter
comparison, but, having rented Manhunter recently and seen Red Dragon
last week, this reviewer is of the opinion that Red Dragon
is the superior movie.  

<p>
Manhunter was essentially an extended Miami Vice episode, lacking
Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs.  Pastel colors, heavy soundtrack,
over-the-top emotionalism, and a focus on standard police work
dominate the movie.  William Petersen is solid as Will Graham, the
FBI agent and title character.  Dennis Farina is also very good as
Jack Crawford, and Brian Cox is good as Lecter.  The rest of the
cast is OK, including a brief appearance by one of Michael Mann's
Miami Vice flunkies, Michael Talbott.  The killer himself is a bit of
an afterthought. He is frightening in his anonymity.

<p>
Red Dragon has the advantage mostly in its cast.  It starts with, of
course, Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lecter for the third time,
but continues with Ed Norton (the best actor of his generation, IMHO)
as Graham, Harvey Keitel as Crawford, Ralph Fiennes as the killer,
Emily Watson as a blind woman who works with the killer, and Philip
Seymour Hoffman as a tabloid reporter who works on the case.  This
is a heavyweight cast!  Add in Mary-Louise Parker as Graham's wife
and Anthony Heald reprising his role as Doctor Chilton.

<p>
Red Dragon has more of a Gothic feel than Manhunter.  Manhunter
focused on Graham's sanity: whether he could keep a grip on it in
face of the
horror of dealing with another serial killer.  Red Dragon downplays
Graham's experience in a psychiatric institute and his ability to
``get inside a killer's head", passing the latter off as somewhat
dependent on his collaboration with Lecter before the latter was
exposed as a cannibal.

<p>
Another big difference with Red Dragon is the focus.  Whereas 
Manhunter is focused mostly on Graham, Red Dragon pays more attention
to the killer, and of course to Lecter whenever he appears.  Red
Dragon tries a bit more to understand the killer.  Ralph Fiennes
is interesting in this film, not merely because he repeatedly
walks around naked with fascinating tattoos.  But still, he's no
Buffalo Bill.

<p>
Neither film measures up to Silence of the Lambs.  But what does? 
Aside from Se7en, no film in the serial-murder genre has come close. 
Why SotL remains the king:

<p>
- Multiple Miggs

<p>
- the abduction scene of the Senator's daughter

<p>
- Hannibal's escape

<p>
- Clarice's good bag and cheap shoes

<p>
- Buffalo Bill dancing around naked

<p>
- fava beans and a nice chianti

<p>
- the night vision scene

<p>
- ``It puts the lotion in the basket."

``Tuck Everlastin" === a movie

<p>
In 1828, while traveling west to find their new home, the family Tuck drank 
from a spring at the foot of an ancient oak tree.  From that moment forward 
they were immortal.  They didn't age, they didn't get ill, they could not be 
wounded, they seemingly could not die.  

<p>
Tuck, or so they called the patriarch, was somewhat wise.  He figured out 
that he and his were not aging like those around them.  He thought of the 
spring because of the great sense of wellbeing they had all felt when they 
drank from it.  He also thought that the rest of the world would not 
understand, they would resent the Tuck's accidental abilities.  So, he and 
his made it be a secret.

<p>
Miles, the older Tuck son had married and started a family.  He tried to 
bring his wife into the secret.  She chose instead to believe that he must 
have sold his soul to the devil.  She took herself and his children away.  
She took his joy away with them.

<p>
Jesse, the younger son, was just seventeen.  He was going to be seventeen 
until the end of time, maybe longer.  

<p>
Seventy five years later, the Tuck's have secretly returned to the woods that 
hides the spring.  The boys are traveling the world.  Tuck and his wife are 
living a simple life on the edge of a small lake.  The year is 1915.

<p>
Winifred Foster is just fifteen years old.  She is the only child of the 
richest man in that part of the state.  Her family owns the woods.  She can 
see through the high iron fence that divides her small world from the outside 
world.  Her family wants her to grow up to be a lady.  Winnie just wants to 
be free.

<p>
This is the back story for the movie ``Tuck Everlasting".  It is all about 
young love, between an immortal and a human girl.  It is also about the 
problems of being an immortal in a world that hardly believes such is 
possible, but would kill for it all the same.

``The Tuxedo" - a movie

<p>
As big a Jackie Chan fan as I am and as disappointed as I have been with 
Jennifer Love Hewitt in the recent past I never thought I would see myself

oblivious to what is happening around her, Del Blaine was always funny.

``The Transporter" === a movie

<p>
Luc Bessen makes some pretty good movies.  This isn't one of them.  He gets 
half a writing credit.  He has done much better work.

<p>
The action was outstanding.  Jason Statham is very convincing as an action 
hero.  Actually considering that he is a criminal, maybe anti-hero.

<p>
The plot lacks a certain cohesion.  Much of what happened happened to give 
Statham a chance to kick butt.  Qi Shu was very cute.  Still, it would have 
been nice to have a real story too.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Steve, Steflan of aol.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((The stunts and production values (filmed mostly on the French Riviera
and in those nearby mountains where you see the Tour de France bicyclists ride)
were generally stupendous.
And I've never seen Jason Statham before, but really liked him..... wait a
second, wasn't he also ``Turkish" in the brilliantly fun ``Snatch''???
(also a Dennis Farina movie....)  Yes, I'm sure he was.
He has a future, he's one of those young guys, looks about 30, who looks old
and can do kick ass action movies.
Qi Shu was funny, if a bit over the top.... that line that ``he was a bastard,
but he was still my father'' was just a BIT too much.))

<p>
((But, I'd like dispute you a bit on the ``uber'' focus of the movie.
At least this is what I thought about watching it..... what happens when
control freaks (and Frank is THE most extreme control freak I've ever
seen on film) are taken ``out of control''.  Not deep, doesn't totally
overcome the over-emphasis on the stunts at the expense of serious 
dialogue, but it did keep my involved as I kept thinking..... he should
just back off and ``take control'' like he did before.))</i>

``Knockaround Guys" === a movie

<p>
I first saw a preview for ``Knockaround Guys" a year or so ago.  Coming soon 
to a theatre near you.  It never arrived.  I figured that it had to be pretty 
bad.  I put it on my `to see' list anyway.  Vin Diesel was in the preview and 
I was already a big fan.  I figured that even a bad movie was worth seeing 
for a chance to see Diesel.

<p>
I saw a second set of previews half a year later, and again, no movie.  Then 
Vin Diesel started gaining steam, and ``Knockaround Guys" came around a third 
time.  This time it even opened.

<p>
It was better than anticipated.  The story had a plot, some character 
development, all the elements.  I was surprised.  Vin Diesel, in a small 
part, did his thing and was very convincing.

<p>
Still, even though it was better than I expected it really isn't all that 
good a movie.  It's hard to feel sympathy for children of the mob whose 
fathers don't take them seriously.  Kids whose ambitions include being 
members of the mob are not my first choice for central characters.  Barry 
Pepper as `Matty Demaret' plays the conflicted character of a kid who doesn't 
want to be a criminal but does want to get his father's respect by being good 
at being a criminal was actually pretty good.  Seth Green as ``Johnny Marbles" 
was totally miscast.  ``Marbles is half an idiot, and that's the good half."  
At least that was the description.  Seth Green comes off as too intelligent 
to be half an idiot.

``Abandon" === a movie

<p>
Stephan Gaghan wrote and directed ``Abandon."  Really good job.  The story is 
told in dreams, flashback, fantasy, alternate universe sort of stuff.  The 
characters are college kids.  They are smart.  What is really remarkable is 
that they say smart things.  They are really very insightful kids.

<p>
Katie Holmes plays ``Katie Burke" a very bright small town girl who has a 
fragile sort of thing going that makes men want to rescue her.  It would be a 
really good artifice for getting men, except she isn't aware that she is 
doing it, and pretty much ignores the men that get sucked into it.  It is 
nice to see her with a good role for a change.

<p>
Charlie Hunnam plays ``Embry Langan" a double rich, very talented, genius who 
also happens to be a clinical narcissist.  He manages to see through Katie 
and works his way past her defenses and gets her to fall in love with him.  
Then, once he has accomplished that, he walks away.

<p>
He left school just before his graduation, cum laude, and after a spectacular 
good bye scene, disappears.  Two years later, because there is a lot of money 
involved, a lawyer starts to put pressure on the authorities to find him, or 
his body.

<p>
Benjamin Bratt plays ``Wade Handler" a cop with a serious substance abuse 
problem of his own.  He is given the task of finding Embry as his first 
assignment after his trip through detox.

<p>
The detective starts looking for the missing boy friend, and Katie starts 
seeing him around.  She isn't really over him after two years, and seeing him 
stalking her both scares and elates her.  But as I said, the story is told in 
dreams, and flashbacks and fantasy trips, so it isn't easy to know just what 
is happening, even when it is happening right before your eyes.

<p>
Perfect ending by the way.

``Superfly" meets ``lock stock and two smoking barrels"

<p>
There are no good guys in this one.  We have a super chemist who has devised 
a drug that will outdo heroin, cocaine, and ecstasy.  Three drug lord who 
want to own the monopoly, various underlings, a small time crook errand boy, 
a killer for hire, a street gang, crooked cops, and a con man.  Shake well 
and prepare to laugh!

<p>
Considering the body count its hard to think that this is a comedy, but some 
of the funniest parts are when people are getting killed.

<p>
Samuel L. Jackson produced and played ``Elmo McElroy" the kilt wearing chemist 
out to make one really big score.  Robert Carlyle played ``Felix DeSouza" 
street punk and ultimately Jackson's sidekick.

The plot twists and turns, and the final twist sort of makes it all come out

``I Spy" === a movie

<p>
Back in the day Robert Culp and Bill Cosby played ``Kelly Robinson" and 
``Alexander Scott", a professional athlete and his trainer traveling around 
the world, secretly working for the CIA.  Now Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson 
pick up the names, if not the characters, and play the whole thing for 
laughs.  

<p>
These two are both good at comedy.  Wilson's `almost pretty good spy' and 
Murphy's `I'm the king of the world boxer' have their moments.  The story has 
just enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.  What action there is, 
is played for laughs.

<p>
Famke Janssen played ``Rachel Wright" the girl super spy that ``Alex Scott" has 
a crush on.  Turns out she has a good comedic sense and was pretty funny, 
too.

<p>
Not a really great movie, but like Wilson's character, almost pretty good.

<i>((Yeah, that's about it, almost pretty good.
I found the ending a bit lame, but some of the early middle part of the 
movie was just laugh down drag out hysterical, again and again and again.
When Famke came on the scene, even though I knew she was in the movie
and saw her in her last movie, I was fooled completely too.
The surprises actually came across as surprises, even though there were
four writers.))</i>

``Femme Fatale" === a movie

<p>
``Femme Fatale" is the title role played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.  She is a 
bad person.  She is very seductive, becoming whatever the person she is 
seducing needs her to be.  The story is fraught with coincidence.  Or, 
possibly the whole idea is that there is no such thing as a coincidence, 
everything is tied to everything and nothing happens without some purpose.

<p>
Difficult to follow but possibly worth it.  Interesting cinematography.  
Occasional split screen work that sometimes fit what was happening, and 
sometimes seemed pointless.

<p>
I really liked Antonio Bandaras as the part time paparazzi, rescuer, dupe.  

<p>
Gregg Henry gets to play a good guy role for a change.  Most of it as an off 
camera voice.  It was a really small role and I only mention him because I 
recognized him when he stepped out of an elevator in one of the coincidences 
that was never explained.

<p>
I have nothing to say for the ending other than ``Huh?".  De Palma probably 
had a lot of fun making this but he obviously has no idea about story 
construction.  He is a visual director more than he is a writer.

``The Truth About Charlie" === a movie

<p>
The trailers for this had a Cary Grant Aubrey Hepburn sort of look.  Turns 
out it is a remake of `Charade'.  I'm pretty sure I will rent `Charade' now 
that I have seen the remake.

<p>
Mark Wahlberg really doesn't cut it as Cary Grant.  But then, that is a 
difficult job.  
Thandie Newton was just fine as Aubrey Hepburn.  She was cute. beautiful, 
smart, classy, innocent, all the many wonderful parts that made up the 
original.

<p>
The story was much the same, which is a good thing.

<p>
Worth seeing on its own, but `Charade' is a really tough act to follow.

``Time Changer" === a movie

<p>
The small blurb I read said that a man travels forward in time.  That was 
enough to pull me into the theater.  Turns out the movie is Christian 
Propaganda.

<p>
A Christian professor of theology in the 1890s has written a book.  In it he 
proposes that it is important to teach Christ's message even if you can not 
teach about Christ.  His thought was turned to people of other religions.  He 
wants his school to endorse the book in hopes of improving sales and 
increasing his audience.

<p>
One of his fellows feels strongly that he is making a serious error.  That it 
is vital to teach people about Christ first, and that Christ's teachings 
should never be separated from Christ.  Since this professor just happens to 
have a time machine in his barn, he sends the author ahead in time to show 
him the seriousness of separating the teachings from the God.

<p>
We are the example of what can go wrong.

<p>
The traveler is amazed and appalled.  He is sure that he has been projected 
to the end of time, that the signs of the end of the world abound.

<p>
Lots of preaching goes on.  Lots of Christian testament.  Not really a great 
movie.  In my case it didn't really accomplish its goal.

<i>((Really?
Fascinating.
This is part of a large effort/trend to offer an alternative set of
production values based on Christian fundamentalism that is going on right now.
I have not seen the movie, nor heard of it opening anywhere near here,
which doesn't surprise me too much.
I think the organization that is responsible for this one is the 
one at ChristianCinema.com that also does a lot of alternative teen movies.))</i>

``Punch Drunk Love" === a movie

<p>
This is an Adam Sandler movie in the way the ``The Truman Show" is a Jim 
Carrey movie.  In short, they didn't really leave their mark and it may be 
their best work.

<p>
This movie starts weird.  It is very loud at times.  The use of light in the 
cinematography is unusual.  There may be symbolism that has eluded me.  

<p>
It's a love story that is somewhere between a little and a lot different from 
any love story you may have seen before.

<p>
I'm not sure that I like it.  I like lots of parts of it though.

<p>
Oh, I've been meaning to send some commentaries.  Let's do 
baseball first:

<p>
The Red Sox started 40-17, but after that they were essentially a
.500 team.  Still, they might have made the playoffs most years,
except for the red-hot finishes of both the A's and the Angels.  What
went wrong? I think we have to keep things in perspective: the Sox
have only won more than 93 games twice since the heyday of Rice,
Lynn, Fisk, Yaz and co.  
<i>((Still, put it in perspective the other way too, the Devil Rays
and the Orioles were truly awful, so there were some VERY easy wins
in there.))</i>

<p>
Well, the starting pitching fell apart.  Burkett, who started very
hot, became very cold, and Castillo just plain sucked.  Moving
Wakefield to the starting rotation helped some, but with both
Wakefield and Lowe moving from the pen to the rotation this year, the
bullpen suddenly became a weak point, whereas it had been a strength
last year.  What happened to El Guapo?  In any case, in the second
half of the season, there were basically two Red Sox teams: the one
with Lowe or Pedro starting, and the one with anybody else starting. 
The former team could beat anybody, and the latter team was quite
awful to watch.

<p>
What positions could be improved?  First base is the most obvious
place to start.  I don't think Brian Daubach is the answer, either. 
He's way too streaky:  he feasts upon mediocre pitching and is easily
shut down by the better pitchers.  We need hitters who can hit well
against good pitching.  Right now, we have three, maybe four such
hitters (if Cliff Floyd stays).  Daubach, Varitek, Nixon, and
Hillenbrand just don't inspire confidence when they face the better
pitchers.
<i>((Nixon actually hits better against better pitchers.... and
his OBP isn't bad either, he gets maligned a bit too much.
Eventually, he's going to be a really, really solid hitter,
it just will take him a long time to get there.))</i>

<p>
A notable stretch occurred in June, when the Sox were 5-13 against
the NL.  Thanks to the evil forces controlling baseball, the Sox are
going to be forced to play the Braves 6 times/year while the Yankees
get to play the Mets 6 times/year.  In addition to those 6 rough
games, the Sox got 3 nasty games against the Diamondbacks, and 3
rough games in LA against the Dodgers.  No other AL team had 12 games
against teams of that caliber.  Late in the season I noticed that the
Sox actually had a better record against AL opponents than Oakland
did, but that the As had feasted upon a weak interleague schedule.

<p>
From that point in June, it became clear that good pitchers could
beat the Sox.  It didn't help that Manny was out for 7 weeks, and
that when he came back it took him another month to regain his form.

<p>
What do the Sox need?  Another starter, help in the bullpen, and more
hitting at first base.  It would be nice if Casey Fossum could turn
into a good starter.  The Sox haven't developed a home-grown reliable
starter since Roger Clemens.  They just cannot get away with that. 
Contrast that situation with the situation in Oakland, which has even
more starters coming up in addition to the big three.

<p>
Playoffs: the Yankees pitching fell off a bit this year.  None of the
starters inspires real fear any more.  Mussina is inconsistent,
Clemens is getting old, and Pettite has always been on and off. 
Still any of those three or Wells can throw a great game on any day.
The real problem is the bullpen, which has been consistently getting
worse since 1998.  Now Rivera is positively hittable.  Good news for
the rest of the league.  The bad news is that the Yankees hitting is
the best it has been in recent memory.  The addition of Giambi and
the breakout year by Soriano made a good offense into a great
offense.  (Why does Giambi get almost no consideration for the MVP? 
Writers really have no fixed criteria when it comes to MVP voting. 
Hasn't Giambi had a better season than Soriano? Of course, ARod
really deserves the award in any case.  But somehow ``most valuable
player" has come to mean ``most valuable player on a team with enough
other good players to contend for the a league title" even though we
are constantly told baseball is a team sport, that doesn't get
factored into MVP voting.)
<i>((I agree, I don't why Giambi doesn't get more consideration,
just because he had a stinko April??
Makes no sense.))</i>

<p>
Anyway, the Yankees are the team to beat in the AL.  They have to get
past both the Angels and the A's to make the World Series.  About the
only thing I'm sure of is that the Twins won't win the AL.  Yankees
should be favored, but only slightly, and they face a tougher path
than the As do.

<p>
To the NL: the Braves are back, thanks to the addition of Sheffield
and the blossoming of Andruw Jones.  They finally have some decent
hitting to go with their pitching.  The Cardinals appear to have a
complete team, and they are playing with a ``we're on a mission from
God" attitude that one has to respect.  I think they will beat the
D-Backs, who have run out of hitting with the recent injury to Luis
Gonzalez.  Of course, Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling could each
pitch no-hitters.  I also like the Giants, but we are looking at two
postseason funks which might cancel each other out.  Who will
continue to underperform more in the postseason, the Braves or Barry
Bonds?  If I were a betting man, I would go with the Cardinals here.

<p>
I won't make any other predictions because I want the Yankees to win
so badly it colors my judgment.  And I would hate to spoil any
rooting against them by actually picking them to win something.  (It
was bad enough having Jorge Posada on my fantasy team.)  

<p>
That's it for baseball.

<p>
Football:  yes, the Pats are ``for real".  In this upside down world
in which political analysts write columns telling me why Gore ``lost"
the 2000 election (as if the loss represented some electoral trends),
we now get to witness pundits asking whether the Pats are for real
AFTER they won the Super Bowl!  Also, the big development for me is
to see that Brady is for real.  I had not been a believer in his
ability last year.  I wouldn't worry much about their run defense. 
Priest Holmes runs on everybody and Tomlinson got lucky with a few
long runs.  
<i>((Interesting how your statement about the Pats went from 
right on, to way wrong, to right on again since you made it....))</i>

<p>
The best story of the season has been the complete failure of the
Rams. This should have been obvious after their preseason, but
pundits were dismissive and certain that they would return to last
year's form.  I think the psychic damage of losing to the Pats was
underrated.  Also, I'm not sure Mike Martz is a great head coach.

<p>
Final topic: Signs.  I really did not like this movie.  However, I've
come upon a theory which vindicates it to me somewhat.  

<p>
Signs suffers from a massive case of ``Deus ex Machina", if I can say
this without giving away too much.  As a science fiction movie, it's
crap.  We have aliens who can fly millions of miles through space to
Earth, but communicate to each other by making crop circles?  (What,
they don't have radios?)  And they chose to make crop circles which
were patterned after earlier crop circles which had been documented
to be fakes?  How bizarre!  And, in spite of the fact that they have
the technology to make their ships invisible as they hover, they
decide that what they want to do is to take people away using 
a ``Night of the Living Dead" strategy.  Perhaps they were all stoned?

<p>
Why would M. Night Shamalyan, who had created the brilliant movies
The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, make such a piece of junk?  Well, it
wasn't really a sci-fi movie at all, which should be obvious.  It was
theological pandering.  The movie isn't about aliens, it's about Mel
Gibson having lost his faith because of his wife's death.  But
(massive spoilers here) he regains his faith because his wife told
him something while she was dying which helps him fight off the
aliens.

<p>
This is Shadowlands for retards.  It's just stupid.  I guess God
didn't really want to test Mel Gibson's faith, since he provided such
obvious evidence of his existence.  Problem is: the entire situation
is absurd and contrived.  In real life, dying women don't provide
pearls of coded prescience like this.  

<p>
Then it occurred to me: all of the major twists in the movie, the Deus
ex Machina developments occur in a direct relation to Night's
character, the veterinarian.  It was the vet who killed Mel's wife. 
The alien was trapped in his pantry.  He was the one who told Mel
that the aliens didn't like water.  So, instead of Deus ex Machina,
we have Night ex Machina.  It's like he's saying:  see, I control the
movie.  Since I'm the writer and director, I can have anything happen
which I want to happen.  In fact, I'll flaunt this fact by playing
one of the characters myself, and having that character be the one
who's pushing all the developments forward which shape Mel's life.

<p>
Once I realized that, I had to grin.  Such audacity!  

<p>
It's too bad, because ultimately Signs was the movie I had the
highest hopes for this summer, and it fell short.

<p>
On the other hand, I watched <i>Road to Perdition</i> with very low
expectations.  I've come to get weary of Tom Hanks.  He is positively
smarmy at times.  And he seems to carry himself with an arrogance
which he never had pre-<i>Philadelphia</i>.  

<p>
In <i>Road to Perdition</i>, we see a great performance by Paul Newman and a
great imitation of Paul Newman by Tom Hanks.  Having said that, Hanks
is good enough to pull off the role, simply because he's imitating
such a great actor.  I was worried that the movie would be overly
sappy, as happens with Hanks movies these days.  And yes, it was
sappy.  But not overly so.  (Aside: Jude Law's character was simply
ridiculous in this movie.  He didn't pull it off, whatever was
supposed to happen there.  I don't blame Law - the character was
simply ill-conceived.)  
<i>((Remember it started life as a comic book/graphic novel.
A bunch of scenes, including the last ones with Law, you could see
how they just worked so well in a graphic novel.
Jude Law's character was SUPPOSED to be just a deus ex machina
(to pull in your good idea) without real character.
Still, it was an OK movie.))</i>
So, going into <i>Road to Perdition</i> with very
low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was better than I
had expected, but still only a moderately good film.   It just
reminds me how good the <i>Godfather</i> series was.

<i>((Just a couple of comments.... this from Peter Gammons' sister:
After the Red Sox hot streak at the beginning, every single
10 game stretch they were either 4-6, 5-5, or 6-4 until the
very end where they had ONE slightly hotter streak.)) 

<p>
((Castillo only stunk as a starter, with the exception of that
ONE game where they left him in there to ``take ten earned runs
for the team" he was close to brilliant in long relief
with an ERA in the Pedro/Lowe/Wake range.  I say they bring
Castillo back as a long reliever and he pitches very well
in that role.  I'm not excited about the fifth starter after
those three plus Fossum..... can't we find someone new
to slot in there?  Unfortunately, probably not, so we're
stuck with Burkett.  They better get a GREAT bullpen behind that
for next year.))

<p>
((I am not a ``break up the team" fan.  I think they do need to 
consider moving Shea to first though, unless they can get
him over the throwing yips.  I think he ended up with 25 
errors at third!!  But I'd be happy with getting ONE more
bat.  As you say, 93 wins was pretty damned good most years.
I predicted only 95 and that wouldn't have done it either,
where I was sure it would have.  At least I can root for
Barry and my Giants in the playoffs, and the A's to beat
the Yankees.  Another Bay Area series would be dynamite
and I predict that, for the little that's worth!))

<p>
((PS: The schedule for next year is out already.  They've 
scrapped the ``natural rivals" bit that had the Red Sox
playing and losing home and home with the Braves every
year and the Red Sox Interleague entirely get junky teams
like Milwaukee, the Cubs, the Pirates, and the Astros in the
Central!  Bet on the Sox RIGHT now to finally get the
wild card next year with all those games again those
plus the Tampa Bay, Baltimore, and Toronto usual suspects.
They end up against almost the same teams as this year in
the same order, including Tampa Bay to finish up if it's
close.))</i>

Yankees are coming back but too little, too late....

<p>
Looks like the Twins have something to say about things..right now
they lead 4-1 going into the 9th. 
If they can hold this lead, I'll definitely be rooting for a St.
Louis-Minnesota World Series.

<p>
The Yankees fell apart in the post-season because they simply got
shellacked by the Angels hitting.  Is the Angels hitting that good? 
Well, it's good, but I think the problem which I'd been forecasting
for years finally came to bear.  The Yankees have a bunch of old
starters, and the point finally came where they were no longer
dominating.  OK, Mussina and Pettite are not that old, but neither
were either of those two as good as they had long been advertised.

have in the past.  This is a new team and it needed to come

<p>
And perhaps you'd be interested in something non-Dip - like, say, the 
beginning of hockey season?  It's too late to go public with my baseball 
playoff predictions (Braves over Cards in the NL; Twins over Yanks in 
the AL), but they drop the puck in just five days.  I'm psyched, and 
there's no reason not to inflict that on you.  Thus, one man's preview 
of what's coming over the next few months, in the order I see the teams 
finishing within their divisions:

<p>
NORTHEAST

<p>
1.  Ottawa - Lots of youth on offense, but they're enormously talented.  
Gave up a good backup goalie when they traded Jani Hurme, but they still 
have the best talent in the division.  This team is a serious Cup 
contender.  Best young player:   Take your pick.  Marian Hossa, Martin 
Havlat, Mike Fisher, Wade Redden, and Chris Phillips are all 25 or 
younger.  Even Radek Bonk, who's been around forever, is just 26.

<p>
2.  Boston - The loss of Dafoe in net will hurt.  Joe Thornton and 
Sergei Samsonov are major studs on offense, but who'll anchor the blue 
line?  Add in a weakness on the power play, and there's little chance of 
catching Ottawa.  Of all the teams I'm ranking, this is the one most 
likely to finish lower than what I've ranked.  Best young player:  
Thornton, just 23, will be a major star.

<p>
<i>((Strangely enough, youngster Jonathan Girard is finally becoming
what they said he would become (only five points so far, I think, but
getting better every day), and Bryan Berard has been resurrected and has
FIVE goals already!!
No worry about that injured eye on that guy.
The coaches are even trying to get him to SLOW THE HECK DOWN, as
he skates around like a madman who has five minutes to live.))</i>

<p>
3.  Toronto - Just a few years ago, this looked to be a franchise on the 
rise, but their key forwards are aging.  This team can still score some 
goals, and will win some 6-5 games; no strong defenders to take over a 
game anywhere in sight.  Ed Belfour was brought in to mind the nets, but 
his best days are behind him.  Best young player:  Not much to choose 
from here, but we'll go with defenseman Tomas Kaberle, 24, who does have 
good potential.

<p>
4.  Montreal - (Sigh.)  We Habs fans have not had much to cheer about in 
years.  Sure, there was last year's surprise win over the hated Bruins 
in the first round of the playoffs, and then a fast start against 
Carolina in the second round . . . followed by three quick losses and 
elimination.  The chief problem is defense; the Habs haven't had a 
dominant blueliner since Vladimir Malakhov's heyday a few years ago.  
Saku Koivu's emotional return and Jose Theodore's incredible season 
helped the team overachieve, but it won't happen again.  Best young 
player:  There isn't one.  Okay, as long as I've got to name someone, 
defenseman Andrei Markov, but don't tell anybody you heard it from me.

<p>
5.  Buffalo - Which will be worse, missing the playoffs with a pitiful 
power play, or filing a Chapter 11 petition in Bankruptcy Court?  The 
Sabres get to do all these things.  At least the team has a good supply 
of players nearing their prime, so the bad news could end soon.  But not 
this year.  Best young player:  Forward Tim Connolly.

<p>
ATLANTIC

<p>
1.  Philadelphia - Mix aging forwards with aging defenders and a goalie 
with only a good couple of years, and maybe things don't look so good.  
But in the Flyers' case, they look just fine.  Two good forward lines 
and a solid cast of defenders will get Philly the division title this 
year.  Best young player:  Gotta be left winger Simon Gagne, though 
Justin Williams, just 20, has the chance to catch him.

<p>
2.  New York Rangers - The key here is the health of three key players:  
Newcomer Pavel Bure, Eric Lindros, and Mike Richter.  The three of them 
combined for just 195 games last year, and they've all been brittle at 
times.  The guess here is that they'll light up Manhattan with goals, 
but the defense will let in its share, too.  Best young player:  Young?  
Rangers?  Must be a wrong number.  Well, maybe Dan Blackburn, who's 
apprenticing under Richter.  But at 19, he's a ways away from being a 
major player in the NHL.

<p>
3.  New York Islanders - Last year's surprise surge was no fluke; the 
Isles stole goalie Chris Osgood - off the waiver wire! - and that, 
added to their offseason moves to improve the attack (Yashin and Peca), 
resulted in a much better team.  I think it's for real, and next year, 
they will supplant the Rangers and challenge the Flyers for supremacy in 
this underrated division.  Best young player:  It's easy to say Rick 
DiPietro, the 21 year old goalie who was taken #1 a couple of years ago.
But when he debuted in 2000-01, he had a porous defense in front of 
him, and got hammered, which can't be good for a kid's confidence.  
He'll recover and become a star.  But not this year.

<p>
<i>((Off to a slow start, but we love these guys and think they will
turn it around....))</i>

<p>
4.  New Jersey - How the mighty have fallen.  Martin Brodeur is still 
there, the magnificent goalie with the oh-so-ordinary save percentage.  
But much of the supporting cast that made this recent Cup contender is 
gone.  The most recent departure is Petr Sykora, traded to Anaheim.  The 
chief acquisition in that trade was offensive blueliner Oleg Tverdovsky, 
but there aren't too many good defensive defensemen left, and that'll 
make life hard on Brodeur.  Patrik Elias and Scott Gomez will have to 
carry most of the offensive burden.  The franchise is sinking.  Best 
young player:  Gomez is only 22.

<p>
5.  Pittsburgh - They say Mario is going to play 70 games this year.  
Mmmm-hmmm.  I'd love to see it, to see if he still has the wonderful 
touch he once had.  But I seriously doubt his health will hold up.  
Martin Straka's recovery has been faster than expected, but he, too, has 
to be regarded as an injury risk.  That leaves perpetual breakout 
candidate Alexei Kovalev to carry the offensive burden.  Ain't gonna 
happen.  Best young player:  A close call between a couple of 
blueliners, Andrew Ference and Michal Rozsival.  Ference is smallish, 
but has the offensive skills to complement the forwards.  Rozsival will 
thrive if he's placed at the point on the power play.

<p>
<i>((The new refereeing is taking hold and you could well be 
wrong about Mario.
He might be MVP of the league so far.
And he has what, 30 points, after playing in ALL 14 games??))</i>

<p>
SOUTHEAST

<p>
1.  Washington - This is a tough call, as Carolina will press the Caps hard
for the division lead.  The addition of Robert Lang, probably to Jaromir
Jagr's line, should mean a nice boost in scoring for both of them.  The
concern is in net; there's really no one behind Olaf Kolzig.  Best young
player - The heir presumptive to Olie the Goalie is Maxime Ouellet, just 21,
but he may not even make the team for a while.

<p>
2.  Carolina - Last year's Cup finalists are developing into an excellent
franchise, with talent on the ice and brains in the front office.  Jeff
O'Neill is one of the better snipers among LW's.  The problem here is also
in net; Arturs Irbe is a bit past his prime, and his backup, Kevin Weekes,
suffered a seizure last week.  Some extra depth at RW wouldn't hurt.  Best
young player - Look for defenseman David Tanabe, 22, to double last year's
point total.

<p>
3.  Tampa Bay - There's a big dropoff here from the talent level of the top
two teams; it's unlikely Tampa, Florida, or Atlanta will see the playoffs.
But the Lightning are loaded with youth.  Last year, everyone expected
center Vincent Lecavalier to develop into a star, but Brad Richards will
beat him to the punch.  Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin will be exposed by a
porous corps of defensemen.  Best young player - Richards and Lecavalier are
both just 22; they'll soon be joined by 19-year-old center Alexander Svitov.

<p>
4.  Florida - Well, so much for the combination of Bure brothers; Pavel left
for Manhattan, leaving Valerie to find his way among the wreckage of the
upcoming, difficult season for this franchise.  Bure and Viktor Kozlov, upon
whom the Panthers will count for much of their offensive punch, are brittle,
having missed a combined 83 games last year.  Best young player - Roberto
Luongo, 23, is perhaps the best of the young crop of goalies - and I mean
in the league.

<p>
5.  Atlanta - If the Thrashers could somehow find a way to play their first
line of Dany Heatley, Ilya Kovalchuk, and Slava Kozlov for 60 minutes a
game, they would be awesome (or at least exciting to watch).  But hockey
teams generally use four lines, and there just isn't any heavy-duty talent
beyond the first few forwards.  Things are looking up, though, as the farm
system is excellent (this is what happens when you get lots of high draft
picks over time).  The blue line is improving, too, but this team has a long
way to go all around.  Best young player - Kovalchuk is already one of the
most thrilling players in the league, and he's all of 19.  Within a very few
years, he will be one of the top five players in the entire league, barring
injury (which ended his season prematurely last year).

<p>
CENTRAL

<p>
1.  Detroit - Curtis Joseph has got to be the happiest player in the NHL.
He walks into the middle of a roster loaded with Hall of Famers, virtually
certain to be in a position to challenge for the Stanley Cup.  The good news
is, the Wings are loaded again.  The bad news is, they're loaded with guys
who will be collecting Social Security checks in a very short time.  The
average age of their big guns - Yzerman, Shanahan, Fedorov, Hull,
Robitaille, Larionov, Lidstrom, Chelios, and Joseph - is 36.  A couple of
key injuries, all too likely with an aging roster like this, might derail
the Detroit Repeat Express.  Best young player - Boy, you really have to
hunt around for a guy born after the start of the Carter Administration
here.  But forward Henrik Zetterberg, 21, looks to be the real deal.

<p>
2.  St. Louis - This team fell flat last year, just two years removed from a
President's Cup season.  They're showing signs of wear, although they're not
as old as the Wings.  They have lots of talent at forward, but there's
trouble brewing on the blueline (Chris Pronger, perhaps the team's best
player, is out for three months or so with a bum knee).  And I personally
believe that the team suffers from uncertainty in net; Brent Johnson and
Fred Brathwaite are more or less sharing duties, but the team would be
better off with a solid #1 goalie.  Best young player - That's part of the
problem; there really isn't one.  Perhaps defensemen Mike Van Ryn or Barret
Jackman, 23 and 21 respectively, but neither is likely to play a major role
this season or next.

<p>
3.  Chicago - This is a team that has a chance to improve on last year's
disappointing finish, but I really distrust the team chemistry.  Their one
presumptive star player, Eric Daze, is injured.  Alexei Zhamnov will be
asked to pick up the slack, but he's an injury risk, too.  Best young
player - Probably forward Kyle Calder, though he is not exactly a budding
superstar.

<p>
4.  Nashville - The Preds can't score.  They've got a couple of good
goaltenders in Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, but not much else to take the
pressure off the netminders.  Defenseman Kimmo Timonen is an above-average
blueliner, but he doesn't have a lot of company on this team.  The forward
lines will probably suffer from the loss of Cliff Ronning.  Best young
player - Forward Scott Hartnell is 20, and looks to be a formidable player
down the line.

<p>
5.  Columbus - It's probably not fair to pick on recent expansion teams, but
the Jacks are years away from being serious contenders.  They are doing one
thing right, though: Building the team from the goal outward.  Goaltender
Marc Denis is underappreciated; defensemen Rostislav Klesla and Jaroslav
Spacek will eventually develop into stars, and the forwards, . . . well,
like I said, the team is building from the goal outward.  Best young
player - Klesla will eventually become an elite player; he's just 20.

<p>
NORTHWEST

<p>
1.  Colorado - It's been a while since anyone has seriously challenged the
Avs for long-term supremacy in this division, and this season shouldn't be
very different.  As usual, Colorado is loaded, and the recent trade of Chris
Drury for Derek Morris should improve the blueline at the expense of a
surplus forward.  I think both Drury and Morris will benefit from this
trade.  Patrick Roy shows no signs of slowing down, even at 36, and if Peter
Forsberg gets to play a full, injury-free season, the Avs will run away with
this division, and maybe the President's Cup, too; they're THAT talented.
Best young player - The temptation is to say forward Alex Tanguay, but in
reality, the best of Colorado's youngsters is backup goalie David Aebischer.
When Roy steps down, the Avs won't miss a beat in goal.

<p>
2.  Vancouver - Boy, can this team score.  Todd Bertuzzi, Markus Naslund,
Brendan Morrison, and even elder statesman Trevor Linden and defenseman Ed
Jovanovsky can all light up the net.  Dan Cloutier is a better goalie than
most people appreciate.  This team is a serious contender.  Best young
player - The dyamic duo of twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin, 21, give Canucks
fans plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future.

<p>
3.  Edmonton - This franchise has great players in their 20's at every
position, all of whom will be in their prime years within the next few
seasons.  As Colorado ages, Vancouver and Edmonton will surpass them, unless
small-market economics and Canadian economic weaknesses rob them of their
talent.  Edmonton has a solid core of good young players, especially Ryan
Smyth, Anson Carter, Janne Niinimaa, Mike York, and Mike Comrie.  Expect
them to make the playoffs, and maybe surprise a favorite in the first round.
Best young player - Lots to choose from here, but we'll go with Comrie, just
22, and a budding star.

<p>
4.  Calgary - Did anyone expect Jarome Iginla to emerge so completely last
year?  He became the first player in about 20 years to win the scoring title
without the surname Gretzsky, Lemieux, or Jagr.  The team's recent
acquisition of Chris Drury from Colorado should give Iginla the impetus to
continue his development, though another scoring title isn't likely.  The
weakness here is in net, with Roman Turek backing up a suddenly weakened
defensive corps.  Best young player - If you think Iginla is too old at 25,
consider 20-year-old RW Chuck Kobasew.

<p>
5.  Minnesota - Aside from Manny Fernandez in net and Marian Gaborik at
forward, there isn't much to get excited about here.  But this is a recent
expansion team, and will take time to develop.  Probably last in the Western
Conference.  Best young player - Gaborik's just 20, and will be a major star
within two or three years.

<p>
PACIFIC

<p>
1.  San Jose - Make no mistake: The Sharks are for real.  I regard them
right now as one of the three best contenders for the Stanley Cup.  They
have plenty of offense, a good set of blueliners, and two excellent goalies
in Evgeni Nabokov and backup Miikka Kiprusoff, who could start for about 25
NHL teams right now.  No apparent weaknesses.  Best young player - Probably
center Patrick Marleau, 23, though defenseman Brad Stuart is just 22 and
should get lots of points on the power play.

<p>
2.  Dallas - Last year was an aberration that few people saw (I sure
didn't); this season, the Stars return to contention behind new #1 goalie
Marty Turco, who brings a marvelous save percentage out from under Ed
Belfour's shadow.  Mike Modano is one of the five best centers in the
league, and Bill Guerin was a major addition to the offense.  Should go deep
into the playoffs with this lineup. Best young player - The Stars aren't
exactly young, but winger Brenden Morrow looks very promising.

<p>
3.  Los Angeles - The Kings always tend to overachieve in the playoffs, and
you have to wonder when they'll put it all together and repeat the '93 run
to the Cup finals.  I doubt this will be the year, but adding Ziggy Palffy
to a lineup that already includes Adam Deadmarsh and Jason Allison (how many
great forwards have the Bruins lost lately?) will defintely help the cause.
A lot of dependable, though unspectacular, players.  Best young player -
Probably 20-year-old winger Jared Aulin, who's dazzling with the puck.

<p>
4.  Phoenix - The 'Yotes are probably the division's fourth playoff team -
this is arguably the most talented division in the NHL - with a no-name
cast that manages to win games.  The preseason rumors of a return by owner
Wayne Gretzky are, alas, just rumors.   I think this team will overachieve
again, though a return to earth wouldn't surprise me.  Best young player -
Daniel Briere is arguably the best player on this team already, at 24.

<p>
5.  Anaheim - Acquired Petr Sykora from New Jersey for Jeff Friesen and Oleg
Tverdovsky.  The trade will help both teams.  Sykora will give the Ducks the
league's best-passing first line, with Adam Oates and Paul Kariya. (Joke
#1 - Kariya is so good, they named TWO countries after him - North Kariya
and South Kariya.  Joke #2 - If old players are long-in-the-tooth, Oates is
a sabre-toothed tiger.)  The blueline will now feature underappreciated
Fredrik Olausson, late of the Red Wings, and Jean-Sebastien Giguere is a
solid netminder.  Still, not enough depth to contend in this strong
division.  Best young player - Stanislav Chistov, 19, is probably as good as
the Thrashers' Kovalchuk.  But he has more competition for a starting slot
here than Ilya has in Atlanta.

<p>
Enough for you?  Game on!

<i>Ripping Yarns Mk III</i> will take the form of a tiny subszine 
in Word as soon as Rip gets some people interested. 
Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.

<p>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly.
You also can sign up for the next Breaking Away game, which is starting now.
Tom Howell currently is signed up, knock off the superstar, come on,
you can do it!!
So far, Eric Brosius wants to challenge Tom.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Harold Reynolds is willing to start a game of Colonia and one of Aberration.
I think the signup list for Colonia includes me, David Hood, Paul Rauterberg,
David Partridge, and (Yes, really!!) Konrad Baumeister.
That means we only need four more.
In the meantime, Konrad, Paul, and David are playing a ``demo game''.
I'll try to get a web address for it in here next time.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper and Kurt Ozog are the only ones signed up for that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A concession to the Fool (Italy) is proposed along with a TIRE
draw for those who TIRE of this game.
Please vote with your spring orders and failure to vote ensures
that both proposals pass...... mostly kidding, but please comment!

<p>
(CHICAGO CALLING): My CUBS acronym got printed as press to
Goz and probably made no sense.  Completely Useless By
September is a fond description of what Cubs really
means.

<p>
(CHICAGO CALLING II): A columnist here calcualted the odds
of the Cubs not winning the World Series for so long
if they at least had a random chance.  Suffice to say it
was something that had a lot of decimals in front of
it.  Ouch.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-BOOB/FRANCE): I'm not sure what the plan was, but it just might
work for one or both of us.

<p>
(FRANCE): Welcome to Cadiz. The Atlantic Ports tour continues in Southhampton.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-ROME): I hope you're right on the first count and I'm afraid you're
right on the second.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-VIENNA): I read your article.  Very enlightening.  But with the
Eagles trouncing the Bears last year and trading Rolen to the (ugh)
Cardinals, I'm not sure I can sell the Philadelphia fan thing.  At least I
know I can find an obscure microbrew.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-MOSCOW): Maybe removing Norwegian can help?

1) Buddy's change of E-Mail to buddytretick of earthlink.net

He's now at batretick of earthlink.net.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  Hey, I don't know who you are, either, but that 
doesn't mean I'll go taking potshots at your dots.  Let love rule, dude.

<p>
(USELESS INFORMATION): You guys do not understand depression.  Try having a
95 year old lady you have been taking care of for 15 years die on you.
Try having your last Aunt on your father's side die on you.  Try visiting 23
gravesites where your ancestors are buried, seeing roots of trees lift those
graves off the ground, and fallen trees crushing the slab of stone that was
on top of those graves.  Try having 75 of your good friends die in the same
year.  Try watching England go down under.  [Opps, shouldn't tip my hand
like that!]

<p>
1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed
and I still didn't have a chance
to do the final Endgame chart.
You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<p>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and would like
to volunteer to guest GM a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next ``big'' game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, could Harold give me an exact count
of how many are signed up?
Also, Harold is running a test game with Konrad Baumeister, Dave Partridge
and Paul Rauterberg
that you can watch on his website.
It's possible this won't start until the test game is finished.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FRET and FREGT draws are rejected again but ONLY the
FREGT draw is reproposed.
Please vote again with your Summer orders.
Generally you need to vote again unless you insist to me that
a vote you have made wants to be perpetual.
A failure to vote may not veto a draw.
I have noted that I don't have a specific rule about calling
a draw with no movement.
You just play on, BUT what I am doing is calling on my rule
for allowing failure to vote on the draws counting as a ``yes''.
This is done with warning.
Starting now, you have to vote EVERY season
or your no vote or failure to vote becomes a ``yes''.
Initially this will NOT count those of you who have given me 
perpetual draw votes, but after another period of no movement,
everyone will have to vote on the draws every season.
At this time, I am not warning you about this.  I will do so
with at least a few seasons notice.

<p>
2) I've had requests about ``speeding up'' the game.
This is certainly possible, but it only can be done 
with the permission of all players.
Thus, I'm not sure it matters in this situation, but feel free to 
tell me that your orders for future seasons are good for a quicker 
run of seasons.  We could sail through a game year every other issue
if you want.
At this time, that request does not have unanimity.

<p>
3) I got slightly confused about what year it was last issue.
This is Spring 1912.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BLACK ARMY to WHITE ARMY):  Observe the board as I demonstrate how much 
more free I am than you.  I can wander through a half-dozen Turkish-held 
centers unimpeded, while you cannot even take a resourceless province 
from him.  I can defeat your draw endlessly, and write whatever I 
choose, laughing at every turn; while you writhe in your soiled diaper 
and whine about who does and doesn't ``deserve" a place in a draw if one 
should come about.  What have you accomplished since coming into this 
game?  Did you build Russia into a major power?  Or have you in fact 
lost centers, lost initiative, lost flexibility, and lost the respect of 
your fellow leaders?  You nearly threw a way your chance at holding a 
stalemate line because I easily goaded you into attacking me instead of 
Turkey.  You nearly threw it away again by failing to maintain a 
defensive coalition.  You might yet lose it all.  And you have 
absolutely no hope of ever eliminating me; all you can do is lose the 
game by erring tactically (or even strategically) out of spite for me. 
I can only say ``Hahahahaha" and repeat my earlier challenge:  ``Come and 
get me, muhfugger!"

<p>
(RUSSIA to ALL): OK, I'm ready to end this in a five-way. This
game is now officially a waste of my time that I no longer need.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.

<p>
3) That goes for the rest of you who NMR'ed as well.
Though you all are free to move units in the Fall.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper and Kurt Ozog are in to be two of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
2) We have a draw proposal for a Ukraine/Germany draw.
Please vote with your Summer orders.
Failure to vote vetoes the draw.

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Forget the tomb that lies beneath the
planks; then I'll come back and dance to him again.''
From ``Nocturne" off <i>Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<p>
(STAR TREK PRESS): This week's Star Trek press has been postponed
in honor of the passing of John Schultz.

<p>
(ROMULAN ANNALS):  It is as we have long suspected.  Repeated use of
the cloaking device in the vicinity of the aliens addles their
brains.  Through years of hard work and convoluted subterfuge,
the animated corpse, Captain Quirk has finally achieved giving
a starbase away that had been promised to Starfleet by the Empire, 
and has enhanced his fleet by stealing starbases from the Klingons.
That he could have achieved all of this by a simple straightforward
approach in less than half the time seems to have completely escaped
his attention.  It appears that the cloaking device scrambles Vulcan
brains as well, as there is certainly no logic in use at Starfleet
command.  However, we do know that Starfleet has a strange fanaticism
about truth in their logs, so we will take them at their word when
they say ``The entire Universe is not united against the Romulans."  
We have an ally out there, and we promise this ally, whomever it
might be, that they will be richly rewarded when they reveal themselves.
