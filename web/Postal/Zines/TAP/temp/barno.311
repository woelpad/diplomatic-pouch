Jim, I'm mailing a CD to you as thanks for decades of your work with 
TAP, including at times its music section.  Attached is my review of the 
album.  It's primarily for your own benefit, but you can print it in TAP 
if you want.  This won't prove notability by Wikipedia standards but 
maybe it'll get noticed in somebody's Google search or whatever.  Or 
maybe there's even a bluegrass fan or two among your readership.

- Mike

Jim, I've mailed you a CD copy of _Live from the Studio_, the second album from the Morgan String Band.  This is the five-piece group that I named as "the best band I heard in 2005" in TAP issue 300.  Flattop guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, standup bass.

     I was never a bluegrass fan until I got turned on to these folks.  As a kid, I would watch entire seasons of _Hee Haw_ on TV and only hear one or two performances that made me say "Wow"; the rest of the music seemed as lame and corny as the jokes.  Occasionally one of the "Wow" songs was Buck Owens in the studio looking twenty years younger than he did in the same episode's "Pickin' and Grinnin'" segment, which is probably one of the thousand reasons I grew up so cynical.

     MSB, though, really kicks it up.  The album is fine but their live shows are what really do it for me.  I attended seven or eight full shows last year, most at different locations, and caught the tail end of a couple of other gigs after all-day trail hikes.  After a winter break, they've returned with several new songs (both originals and covers), and I've heard three more gigs.  The worst I've heard them was maybe a seven on a ten-point scale; most were nines or tens.  Even if I've been hiking or snowshoeing for three or four hours, they get me dancing.  The stuff rocks more than anything I hear on any genre of commercial radio.

     I can't tell you more about their first disc, _First Cut_, than you can find on their website at http://www.cfmsites.com/morganstring/ ; the self-produced album is sold out and apparently won't be reissued.  Nor can I tell you about their third CD since it hasn't been recorded yet.  So I guess I have to tell you about this one.

     They definitely lean toward bluegrass traditions in general, and they went hardcore in that direction by recording all of _Live from the Studio_ around a single microphone, the way it was done in the good old days before you or I were born.  It really feels like you're sitting around a crystal radio set; the downside is that it's often tough to pick out the fourth and fifth instruments unless you turn the volume up to eleven.  That's why I sit or stand up front at live shows, to hear all the richness of these well-orchestrated songs.

     There are bluegrass classics here: Doc Watson's "Wild Bill Jones", Millie Clements' "Lonesome Fiddle Blues", the public-domain "Old Joe Clark", and so forth.  There are also some fine originals: mandolinist Chris Brown wrote "Stop Rocking the Boat" and "Guess You Should Have Known".  Both are among my favorite MSB tunes, even if both are among their more "accessible" (i.e., melodic to a mainstream lister) songs.  The other original here is the instrumental "Jones Road", by guitar player Dave Carey (son of Mark the bassist).  It's good here, but when they played it eight to ten beats-per-minute quicker at one early-2006 show, my fifteen-pound heavy wooden chair started jumping three feet side-to-side because my butt wouldn't hold still.  (There were other fine originals on the first album such as Chris' "That's Right" and Mark's instrumental "Carey Breakdown".)

     One of my favorite song types is well-represented on this album: fun songs that feature a violent death.  From "Wild Bill Jones", over a lad trying to put the moves on the narrator's girlfriend: "He said 'My age is twenty-one, too old to be controlled.' / I pulled my revolver from my side, and I destroyed that poor boy's soul."  From the public-domain "Duncan and Brady", over a sheriff who tries to arrest a bar's big-shot: "White-tailed carriage just a-standin' around / to carry King Brady to the buryin' ground / Them rubber tired buggies, them rubber tired hacks / They took him to the graveyard, never brung him back."  I'll bet if the Mekons played either song you'd be bouncing off the ceiling, Jim.

     There are a couple of modern songs here: the Bruce Hornsby/Don Henley collaboration "The End of the Innocence" is way too Eighties for my tastes, but they do it well.  Don't overlook the encore that doesn't appear on the track listing.  And at live shows, they do fine cross-genre reworkings of Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead tunes among others.

     There are some AVI-format videos on the website, and they have something on MySpace that I haven't checked out, but most of the magic is in hearing them rather than watching them.  One notable exception (not on the first two albums) is "Nashville Cats", as they constantly circle around to get the right instruments highlighted as they swap focus every two or three seconds.  I'd better not write much about fiddler Carol Simek being the most fun to watch on most songs, as she's married.  (Her husband's a musician in a different band.)  Quite often she gets the most graceful dancing-in-place going, not for show but just for her own feeling.  If you don't want to be a lecher, you can just watch her ankle, and on that alone you'll want to get out on the dance floor.  Day-yam!

     Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the music.  I've never been inspired to follow a band around this much, even when I lived with members of two hardcore punk bands in 1989.
