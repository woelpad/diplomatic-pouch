okay, let's see, I hope you have my LAST turn guesses
in case I got any right, I can't remember who I
guessed...

THIS turn my guesses are

1. joakim
2. rick desper
3. brad wilson
4. dick martin
5. richard smith
6. you

and my songs will be:

1. Hindemith - Mathis der Mather - Hindemith is
usually brass-heavy, sometimes to the point of
distraction.  In this piece however the balance is
perfect, especially if you find a good performance.

2. Gary Wright - Who Am I? - From his best album, "The
Light of Smiles", sadly not readily available on CD. 
The whole album blows anything else he's done out of
the water, especially side one (since I have it on
LP).
