Jim,

Only so much head scratching & pencil pushing I can take in a day, so here's my
stuff from TAP307.  We had about two inches (or less) of snow last night.  This
morning, it started up in earnest about the time we crawled out of bed.  So we
moved two cars down to the county road which gets plowed.  Good thing, too, as
there were at least sixteen inches of white stuff out there about sundown.  <G>

The PO didn't cancel your envelope, again!  Can you tell me when you posted the
last ish?  Thanks!

At least this time, I've got a whole week to think about Andy's BPD quiz.  Gonna
be a tough one this round.

I ain't gonna send you any tunes, but if I guess at the guys sending them
anyway, how's that gonna mess you up?  Ha?

1 is obviously Brendan Whyte, and I think you're number 6, but looking at them
tonight, they aren't as clear to me as they were last night on first reading.

So, maybe I won't.  Ha!

I suppose I could send you some starters for the Breaking Away, but there'd be
one condition:  You gotta get rid of the "Finding the Community" game title in
the next issue!  OK?  Deal?

How about:

Team Name: Time Will Tell

You need a manager?  I'll have to think on that one...  <g>

Riders:

Afteryule:   1, 5, 10, 14
Blotmath:    4, 6, 15
Overlithe:   3, 7, 10
Winterfilth: 2, 8, 6

Best wishes,

Tom

Hi Tom, thanks, you're in for the Breaking Away and I was TRYING to make 
that annoying.  Do you have a preferred name for the new game or do you
trust me to come up with one?  I was thinking of "Cast No Shadows" in a 
bit of a play on the Pelaton.  That is, of course, the title of a Mekons
song.....

And NO, you can't guess on 23 tunes unless you enter.... well, you can 
guess, but I won't total up points for you.  I may have to pull out some 
classical tunes for my list so that Brendan Whyte isn't quite so obvious.
