The Asyssinian Prince #310 arrive here last evening and I am mightly impressed.  My, how Diplomacy magazines have changed since those early days of memographs and spirit duplicators of the mid-60's.

You didn't tell me that you were looking for Eric Just as well!  Of course I know where my water brother is!  All you had to do was ask...  You may contact Eric in Oklahoma City at Ericose@aol.com.  In addition to Just's Right Hand Rule, in the world of Diplomacy he should be recognized as one of the originators of Postal Diplomacy.

My regards to you all,
Jeff

Edi,
You have it partially right.  My 1959 Edition of Diplomacy did have numbered units and legal orders could be written such as 3A to Bulgaria and 1F (S) 3A to Bulgaria.  That set came with 10 numbered armies (70 blocks) for each Great Power and either 9 or 10 numbered fleets apiece (66 blocks).  
 
The only "odd" rule that we played was that one could win by having a majority of the pieces on the board.  If I remember the details correctly, I won my first postal game because of that rule.  Eric Just and I had agree to a 17-17 split of the centers on the board.  I reached my 17 first.  On a Spring turn Eric attacked Jim Bradley's one remaining German army in Belgium from the Ruhr and Holland.  I moved into Picardy and Burgandy blocking Jim's retreat and forcing the death of his army.  As a result, I had 17 centers and 17 units while Eric had 17 centers and only 16 units on the board.  I could therefore declare a victory while maintaining the letter of my agreement with Eric.

I have three regular Diplomacy sets:  that original 1959 Allen B. Calhamer edition with a boxed set of numbered armies and fleets (I got my board autographed by Allen Calhamer on July 23rd, 1972), a 1961 Games research, Inc. edition which still came with wooden armies and fleets in a tray but sans the numbers, and a copy of the 1958 edition that Allen sent me.  Unfortunately, those rules were thermofaxed and are almost unreadable in places.  There were diferences in the board as well.  White Russia (Ukraine); Transylvania; Montenegro; Pontus; Anatolia; Erzurum and Persia (Armenia); Mesopotamia; Calabria; The Sea of Marmora; The Bay of Tunis; Algeria and Morocco (North Africa), Cape Saint Vincent, Cape Finesterre, The Bay of Biscay and Point Saint Mathieu (the Mid-Atlantic); Lorraine; Flanders;  Cologne (The Ruhr); The Palatinate and Bavaria (Munich), The North Baltic (The Gulf of Bothnia); Wessex; Clyde; and The Kattegat.

There were thirty five supply centers:
Austria had three centers (Vienna, Budapest and Trieste) plus Tyrol, Bohemia and Galicia.  
England had three centers (London, Liverpool and Edinburgh) plus Wessex, Wales, Yorkshire and Clyde.
France had three centers (Paris Brest and Marseilles) plus Burgandy, Gascony, Flanders and Lorraine.
Germany's three centers were Berlin, Kiel and Coligne.  It's other provinces were Bavaria, Silesia and Prussia.
Italy had Rome, Naples and Venice as centers.  Other provinces were Piedmont, Tuscany, Apulia and Calabria.
Russia had four centers (Moscow, Warsaw, St Petersburg and Sevastapol plus Livonia, White Russia, Finland and Caaucasia.
Turkey's centers are Constantinople, Ankara and Erzurum.  Other provinces were  Smyrna, Anatolia, Pontus, Syria, Mesopotamia and Persia.
The thirteen neutral centers are Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Serbia, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece.

I hope you found this bit of history interesting.

Regards,
Jeff

I also recall that you played this version where the armies and fleets were numbered 
and if the unit was destroyed you could not bring it back and played one unit short forever or 
maybe it was that you had only 8 Armies and 8 fleets and regardless of your center count you could never get more 
that those on the board...
What was the exact weirdness around that anyway?
