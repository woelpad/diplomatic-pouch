Good article on federal budget cutbacks for the National Forests.  I work
for the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie N.F.
The Forest Service is a far less visible land management agency to the
American people than the Park Service is;
so it seems we can bear more of the brunt of the cutbacks without
apparent political fallout.    


Subject: Fw: National forest budgets battered; Seattle Post Intelligencer
4/20/07


By JOEL CONNELLY
P-I COLUMNIST

Struggling to recover from big fall floods in 2003 and
2006 that washed away miles of paths and access roads,
the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has
received a figure for this year's trail maintenance
budget: It is reportedly $15,000.

The budget comes to about 3 percent of the estimated
work needed on just one popular trail -- the Big Four
Ice Caves -- where a bridge is broken in three places.

"If this were someone's annual budget, it would rank a
thousand-plus below the federal poverty level for a
family of three," said Peter Jackson, whose father,
Sen. Henry Jackson, preserved many wild places in the
national forest.

Just this week, the U.S. House of Representatives
voted to designate a 106,000-acre Wild Sky Wilderness,
in the Baker-Snoqualmie north of the Stevens Pass
highway. Our lawmakers spoke of rushing rivers and
wild peaks within two hours' access of 2.4 million
people.

The hyperbole stops at the paymaster's office.

Damage to Mount Rainier National Park in last fall's
flood is a nationwide story. U.S. Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., has found $36 million to pay for repairs.

"National parks are icons, but national forests are
our backyards," said Jay Satz of the Student
Conservation Association.

Mount Rainier National Park welcomes an estimated 1.8
million visitors each year. The 1.7 million-acre Mount
Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest -- more than five
times the size of the park -- draws 5.4 million
people. It has 33 campgrounds, 2,600 miles of roads
and 1,500 miles of trails.

Several premier Rainier-area trails, such as Summit
Lake, are in the Baker-Snoqualmie. The popular route
into Grand Park, one of the park's wonderlands, begins
in the national forest.

In recent years, volunteer labor has shouldered upkeep
of trails in the Baker-Snoqualmie. User fees, levied
at campgrounds and paid by those who park at
trailheads, pay for maintenance.

The Washington Trails Association is in the field even
as the winter snowpack has barely begun to melt. The
Student Conservation Association will put crews in the
Cascades and Olympic backcountry this summer.

Still, there is a limit to what volunteers can do,
particularly when materials are needed.

"I have a feeling many hikers do not understand the
full extent of the degree to which trail conditions
and access have deteriorated, particularly on the
Darrington District, which is still trying to recover
from the 2003 floods: $2.7 million worth of damage
remains unfunded and unaddressed," said Elizabeth
Lunney, executive director of the Washington Trails
Association.

How to get attention to the problem?

A worthy suggestion is to erect stocks outside the
Darrington Ranger Station, into which would be placed
Undersecretary of Agriculture Mark Rey, the former
timber lobbyist who oversees the Forest Service.

Arriving to pay for their permits, recreationists
could pelt Mr. Rey with cabbages. On the way home,
they could ply him with pictures of the washed-out
White Chuck River road.

Or we could send Mr. Rey forth for a day in the
backcountry with a copy of The Mountaineers' trusty
"101 Hikes" book.

He could try the scenic, easy Tonga Ridge trail, only
to find that a road washout has turned it into a
multiday expedition.

Or we could send Mr. Rey up to gorgeous meadows and
the Green Mountain lookout. Oops, another washout. Or
there's the popular Foss River trail up to Big Heart
Lake. Only it was made impassable by last fall's
storm.

A fish rots from the head. And, floods withstanding,
that's what's happening with access to America's
public lands.

The total staffing of the U.S. Forest Service has been
halved in the last decade. The Bush administration
proposes to cut "Smokey Bear's" budget by $64.3
million in the next fiscal year, and cut an additional
2,100 jobs.

So, you say, belt-tightening is needed when the
Bushies are pouring $100 billion into the Iraq rat
hole. The Forest Service can take a 1.8 percent budget
cut. Read the not-so-fine print. The administration is
proposing to spend $911 million for fire suppression,
up from $741 million in the past year. An additional
$292 million is earmarked for "hazardous materials
removal."

By contrast, the Forest Service's recreation budget is
being slashed by 11 percent, to $231 million. Capital
improvement and maintenance are taking an 11 percent
hit, to $66.4 million.

The government's highest-profile land management
agency, the National Park Service, is to receive more
money.

Other agencies, which manage far more land, are
getting the shaft. A total of 225 jobs at national
wildlife refuges were cut between 2004 and 2006. The
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will eliminate 248 more
jobs in the next two years, under administration
budget proposals.

It's a crying, bloody, inexcusable shame.

A big share of the roads, trails and campgrounds in
the Mount Baker Snoqualmie National Forest were built
during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Even when buttressed by fees and volunteers, the
federal government refuses to keep up access to
America's natural heritage in times of prosperity.

"To develop a visceral love for the land, we need to
be connected directly to wild places," said Peter
Jackson.

Or, in Satz's place-specific words, "I want to take my
son to Green Mountain. He deserves the same access
that I had. Magical places that don't take multiple
days are disappearing."
