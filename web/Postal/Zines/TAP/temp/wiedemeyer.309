Fred to Jim
Is that what they mean by "All's fair in love and war"

Maybe, my communication skills aren't what they used to be!!!!!!!!!
Maybe, i've lacked off over the last 30 years.
Maybe, i've mellowed over the years.
Maybe, one of these games, i'll get riled up again, and give them all
a good spanking.
