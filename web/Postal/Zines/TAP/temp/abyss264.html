<br /><br /><i>The Pictures....</i>

<p>

<p>

<p>
<i>((I want to thank everyone for their comments last issue, for those I'm
printing this issue, and any further notes that I get for next issue.
John Caruso and Francine both have read it so far and have told me how
much they enjoyed hearing what everyone wrote about Kathy and they are
passing it along to Kathy's other children, Frank and Phyllis.
These pictures on the front page are courtesy of John Caruso and the
Caruso family.
Thanks, John!!
This will hold up the postal production of the szine (the main reason I
don't do fancy covers) and so I apologize for that, but it will be a
real keepsake, I hope.))

<p>
((I also have a major announcement to make.  
The Hobby Awards Committee has decided to inaugurate a new award in
Kathy's memory, The Kathy Byrne Caruso Lifetime Achievement Award.
It will be given (not necessarily every year) to someone who has
been active in the Diplomacy Hobby in at least three separate decades,
with a multidimensional scope of involvement in writing, play of the
game, and service to the hobby, but now is in retirement or semi-retirement.
They also should have a unique personality that honors the memory of
Kathy Byrne Caruso as one of the hobby's greatest and most memorable
personalities.
There can be a no more appropriate winner of the first award, especially
in light of the worldwide expansion of the scope of the hobby and the
Hobby Awards, than Richard Sharp.
I always knew that Richard was one of the greats in our hobby, but the
interview I conducted with him recently for <b>Diplomacy World</b> cemented
that opinion and expanded it exponentially.
Read that interview with Richard Sharp at:

<p>
 http://www.diplomacyworld.org/issues/issue88/88interview4.htm

<p>
 See below for more on this year's Hobby Awards.
Congratulations to Richard, who shared with Kathy a vice and himself is battling
throat and lung cancer now.
We wish Richard the best in his fight.))

<p>
((Moving back to the Caruso family,
John is now willing to talk to anyone directly, whereas he was a bit 
overwhelmed right after the event.
You can contact John at: 

<p>
 John Caruso, 636 Astor St., Norristown, PA  19401-3745;  
(610) 272-1678, commishjohn of att.net;

<p>
If you want to keep up with the Caruso family, the best way to do so
is to join John's baseball league.
John just now has decided that he wants to keep the league going and there
is need for about four replacements.
Among the dipping old timers, we have Dick Martin, Gary Behnen, Randy Ellis
and Woody playing in the league, along with lots of other Caruso family members
across two generations.
I hope some of you will jump in and play, ask me if you want more information,
I like this approach of REALLY running your team far better than any Rotisserie
league I've ever come across.
This is a huge amount of fun!!!
Now let's get back to your comments.
First off, I'm going to go to Bruce and Krissi Linsey for their best wishes.....))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Bruce and Krissi Linsey (Sat, 31 Aug 2002 14:53:34 EDT)</b>

<i>((Thanks, Bruce, I know John really appreciates your sincere concern.
I tried really hard to get to everyone who needed to know with a personal
note first, but I know many of you found out about this when you received
issue 263 in the mail, the most egregious of those oversights was missing
the man known as ``Toots''.  And he has some of the most interesting 
comments I've heard yet, as should not surprise long time readers of
<b>Mos Eisley Spaceport</b>.
Prepare to laugh and cry heartily....))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>John Michalski (Sun, 01 Sep 2002 10:53:10 -0500)</b>

<p>
Yes, the issue today was the first I heard of it.  Quite a shock.  I guess 
my card to John will be about two weeks behind most.  Still, with my Dip 
stuff down near absolute zero, my contacts with Kathy in recent years were 
limited to perhaps an annual note, and a Christmas card, so it isn't 
surprising I missed the first round of notices.  If Olsen or Woody have the 
obituary, I'd appreciate a copy.
<i>((I actually haven't seen that either.... Woody?))</i>

<p>
The section that followed helped a lot.  I was the one who gave her the 
nickname ``Luscious", which at the time I thought was a somewhat forward and 
outrageous gesture, but compared to her other nickname, ``Bloodsucker" you 
quote, I see that she was probably glad to latch onto ``Luscious".  I really 
appreciated the assorted PudgeCon notes: I remember them all, although to 
me they are all one long smear, not the specific dates and people I was 
(pleasantly) surprised to see Gary Coughlan cite.  I remember the great 
water fight very well: Gary brought a big bag of squirtguns with him, and, 
due to my reputation in the hobby at the time, Gary gave me a ``Dirty Harry" 
gun, a plastic ``six-gun" about 20 inches long and 9 or 10 high. It took a 
gallon to fill, and was not so much a squirt gun as a squirt howitzer: I 
could fire across a room, over the heads of many, and soak down small 
regions on the other side. This was magnified from that balcony sort of 
area outside the bathroom, from which one could fire down onto the main 
floor below, as I recall the layout. On the other hand, Kathy was furious, 
because Gary gave her a tiny little palm sized maroon ``derringer" sized 
squirtgun he said was ``a lady's gun". It worked, but only fired a distance 
equal to three times its length, or in other words, less than a foot.  I 
told Kathy she could wet her hand with it and then shake or throw off the 
water further than that gun would shoot: she said she could throw Gary 
further than that gun would shoot. I think she was right. 
Anyhow,  frustrations such as that no doubt contributed to the rapid 
escalation to cups, glasses, and then containers of water. Despite all the 
talk about ``flooding", the actual water damage wasn't all that bad, 
although for a while there, we were concerned when his wall thermostat got 
in the way of someone's bulk water toss.

<p>
I don't know if it was that Con or another (I suspect it was that one; I'm 
not sure if she attended one, or two?), but I also recall that I tried 
setting her sleeping bag in the bedroom right next to mine.   I tried to 
put the zipper halves together into one big one, in view of the message 
from John to Bob I had been ``warned" of, etc., per the earlier 
commentaries, but the only way they would mesh would leave our heads at 
opposite ends, so I had to skip that idea.  I do recall she arrived to use 
it much later than anyone else in the room, and as she started to lay down, 
a rather nice looking woman from St. Louis or something like that, whose 
name I forget, had come in and suddenly yanked Kathy's pillow away, feeling 
it was hers and had been stolen or something. Poor Kathy didn't see it in 
time, and her head landed with an embarassingly loud Clunk on the hardwood 
floor, with only the bag itself to pad the impact. I was shocked, but 
everyone else (including Kathy) seemed to go on like someone had only 
sneezed or something, so I let it pass too. I would have been ticked, myself.

<p>
<i>((Interesting how so many of our memories are about that which we 
seldom did, which was sleep.... this next memory is equally strong in
my thoughts!!
I remember the profanity T-shirt really well, but can't recall who was
wearing it.... probably Rusnak.
And I'm sure you noticed the picture on the cover of this issue??))</i>

<p>
I remember a group of us went to a steakhouse south along Rock Road, which 
started out as my inviting Kathy out, but degenerated as more of the 
attendees piled in to go along. (For those poor souls who have never 
attended a game convention, the attendees do not travel wearing ties. Most 
were so ratty looking, that most decent restaurants wouldn't let that mob 
in!)  Anyhow, we found a Sizzlin' Sirloin, or Sirloin Stockade, or one of 
those, and were seated. (One guy had opted to turn his profanity T-shirt 
inside out, which helped, and it was getting pretty dark at the door, so 
they seated us before they realized their restaurant was in trouble...).  I 
thought my steak was oddly marinated; an hour later, I realized it had 
spoiled.  Kathy insisted we go back and complain, so we did.  They were 
less than gracious about the complaint, but Kathy's New York background 
meant that we were hardly overwhelmed by their corporate indifference.  We 
got no refund, but I recall we did have the satisfaction of seeing a few 
customers who overheard the ``discussions" with the manager, get up and 
leave.  I think the many references to the Health Dept. got to them, but, I 
could be mistaken.

<p>
I insisted on paying for Kathy's meal because, as I explained, if I bought 
it, it counted as a ``date", while if we each paid for our own, it was just 
a supper. In a rare diplomatic victory for me, she eventually accepted, 
although she did insist on contributing toward some pizzas I went for 
another time.  Someone else with us thought the ``date" thing was a good 
idea, and tactlessly offered me a dollar toward the cost of her dinner 
also, so he could be in on the action. In retrospect, I guess I should have 
declined, but hey, a buck's a buck, right?  (In those days, you could get a 
steak dinner for $2.50 or so.)

<p>
These Cons were a lot like high school reunions, in retrospect.  Lots of 
fun; lots of remembrances now, about girls you should have asked to date 
but were too afraid to; and little of the play had anything to do with Dip, 
more often than not. I saw lots of Titan; talked Kathy into taking a break 
once or twice, and played some 4-way Hearts; learned late at night, how 
funny it is to hear someone stick their head in a bedroom door, and ask 
``Anyone up for a quick game of Civiliation?" (Civ is the only 
non-miniatures game I've ever found that can actually run longer than a 
campaign game of Third Reich). Hobbyists have strange senses of humor: I 
remember Paul Rauterberg drove down from Milwaukee one year, carrying some 
others I think, and had his engine blow up somewhere along the way. The car 
was abandoned, and they came on in somehow anyway, but everyone treated it 
as the funniest thing that had ever happened in their life. Except Paul, 
anyway. The various PudgeCon attendees -and perhaps one or two that went 
to whatever those Cons were years later up in Marshall, Missouri- might be 
interested to know that the old War Wagon, my tan 1976 Thunderbird, 
survived it all (including some nitwits who broke into it in Wichita, and 
used it as their motel room one night!), right up until last December! Yep, 
it was 26 years old, with 377,000 miles on it, when I finally donated it to 
the Salvation Army.  It had gone with me to every Con, and a lot of other 
stuff too, including a 2800 mile round trip to visit what became my second 
wife in 1987. Stops along the way were provided by the graciousness of the 
Ozogs in Flagstaff (half way point), and the Langleys in Sacramento. That 
big, comfortable old thing saw many a sight, and got us all through safely, 
including carrying Kathy once, when I was taking her to or from the KC 
airport I think, and we got lost. Turned out her guess of route was better 
than mine, even though neither one of us really knew where we were 
going.  But since I don't remember her at a Marshall Con, maybe it was 
Wichita?  She'd once talked about flying into OKC and driving up to Wichita 
with me, but that plan fell through. Sorry: it's been 20 years, and I've 
slept since then.  The Thunderbird got regular care, and survived it 
all.  The Ozogs visited us once, in Moore, and they were having car trouble 
all along their route. The place we used, ``Kar Kare", fixed them up when no 
one else had been able to help. 
<i>((Was that the trip with the infamous ``alternator" failure?
I remember laughing and laughing about that one, even though it couldn't have
been funny to Eric and Cathy at the time!!))</i>
They stayed with us when I lived on an 
acreage in semi-rural far southeast Oklahoma City then, so it must have 
been the late 70s.  I think they were the only hobbyists who actually met 
my first wife, the famous ``Claudine" of some of my early ``Notes from the 
American Steppe" in my old <i>Brutus Bulletin</i>. OOPS!  No, there was one kid 
and his family came through also, can't think of his name now, who met the 
infamous ``Fluff" Shaffer in person there, too. I think they settled in La 
Jolla, CA, or somewhere hotsy totsy like that out west in California. They 
were duly impressed/horrified by ol' Fluff, who made quite an impression 
with my AR15 in hand. Any of your readers know who I mean?
<i>((I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps someone will flesh that one out!))</i>	

<p>
Fluff only attended one Con, I don't know which, and didn't stay: he drew 
England in one game, arrogantly and publicly telling the German ``The North 
Sea is adjacent to four centers. Which two do you want?"  That was his idea 
of negotiating. He then proceeded to miswrite his opening orders. The GM 
read them, and a hush fell over the room for a moment, until someone 
whispered ``My God, he's stood himself out of the North Sea!"  That became 
``the Shaffer opening" after that!  About 1903, he did gain a center, 
Holland or Belgium, when he retreated into it after a fleet of his was 
forced to retreat into someone else's empty conquest on a Fall turn. That 
was it for his FTF career. You can see why he left early. I don't know 
where Fluff is now.  Claudine was killed in the bombing, April 19, 1995. 
<i>((Wow, I didn't know that.
I'm still sorry to hear that, even after seven years.))</i>
Hers was the second last body discovered, at the very end of April or the 
start of May, one of the few dates I've forgotten. When someone is feared 
dead, and the house fills with her relatives in the following days, that's 
one thing, but after two and a half weeks, well, let's just say the 
atmosphere changes. At 1.30 that last afternoon, a call to my son said she 
was one of four who would likely never be found, but then at 4.10 they 
called back and said everyone had been found. I never asked for details, 
and her brother, called to identify whatever there was, has never spoken of 
it. We all appreciate the way local officials concluded the matter.

<p>
Speaking of Oklahoma, those articles you printed included a reference to 
``a couple from Enid, Oklahoma".  Jim, NO ONE is from Enid, Oklahoma!  Scott 
and Frauke lived in Minneapolis for many years before returning to Germany, 
probably driven there in part by the high school German I used in sometimes 
writing to them!  There was a couple at a PudgeCon, I suspect that first 
one, who had come up from Texas, perhaps through Enid, but definitely not 
from Enid. The guy was a tall, thin, long-haired Jesus lookalike, or 
unreconstructed hippy; his wife or girlfriend was a petite brunette, very 
quiet. I think he published briefly, but I can't think of their 
names.  Being a couple, they were something of an exception to the crowd in 
Wichita, and I think they left early, never to return. Maybe Pudge, or 
Gary, can recall the names. Or I'll add them if it comes to me during the 
night; I can see this may take a while to finish. (Next day addition: that 
was Guy and Libby Hale. I remember now that when Dave Pilant and I came up 
to Bob's front door and someone asked who we were, I said we were Guy and 
Libby Hale, adding ``Guess which one is Libby?" I guess in today's PC 
climate, that wouldn't occur anymore. For later Cons, most attendees like 
me just walked right in anyway.)
<i>((Hahah! Right you are.
I remember them now.
The ``unusual'' attendees at cons always were the big shocks, especially 
given how exuberant our get-togethers were at that time in the hobby.))</i>

<p>
Kathy was the person who casually referred to me as her ``Toots", which 
Claudine, being a native Okie, pronounced so as to rhyme with Boots, and 
facetiously implied that the nickname referred to a string of small 
farts.  Haven't heard that in a long time.  Toots, that is.  <i>The Brutus 
Bulletin</i> went to Issue 109, which I do recall, mostly because the unprinted 
material I had on hand went to Bruce Linsey, who combined it with an unused 
cover and called it the one and only copy in existence of <i>The Brutus 
Bulletin</i> ``#110". If he sold it for money, good luck to him. I've gone on 
into GMing and playing in postal 4th edition Third Reich: I have to spell 
all that out, because there are three other things calling themselves 
``Third Reich", or ``Computer" 3R, or ``Advanced" 3R, and the most recent 
abortion, ``John Prados' Third Reich".  I run, and play in, the only version 
that works.  I recall one year, I tried playing a few games at a PudgeCon: 
the guy that married Julie Glass -can't think of his name offhand- (Dick 
Martin) was a good opponent. One guy new to it and I, went up to Eastpark 
Mall and bought a copy, just to try playing!  Sorry, I have no idea who it 
was anymore.  John Caruso tried his hand briefly, the only time I ever met 
him, but his experience was all with the early versions, so he was pretty 
much out of his element. Julie was there too, although she forgot most of 
her clothes, but did not let that stop her. 
<i>((Julie and Dick are divorced these days, I saw Dick and their two
children at the Baltimore World DipCon when Dick stopped in briefly.
They both are as gorgeous as one would expect their children to be.
Dick has a website at www.phantomempire.com and a new girlfriend, who
I've met there in chat a few times.))</i>
Her husband and I were the only 
ones so engrossed as to not pay much attention. From later reviews of the 
Con, I gather that a number of others were not so able to concentrate on 
some critical year on the Eastern Front as Dick and I were doing, but I 
thought her presence was rather nice. Definitely exercised the imagination, 
also. I guess to Dick, it was all ho-hum, the same old nude body draped on 
him as ever. To me, well, my hobby (my wives would say, my ``life") would 
become fourth edition Third Reich: whoever the hot bodies are for, they're 
not interested in ME, that's for sure!  Then or now.  Whereas, Army Group 
Center is counting on me, right?

<p>
One of your writers mentioned taking certain joke pictures there in 
Wichita. I think it was Kathy who was going to take a picture of a few of 
us in the kitchen, when I stopped her with an idea. Someone had brought a 
bunch of advance copies of a fake <i>Diplomacy Digest</i> to the Con (a zine by 
Mark Berch at the time), so I grabbed a bunch of them and laid them in and 
around the overflowing trashbags, others on the floor, and some casually 
tossed around to look like they had been used as napkins or tissues, and 
THEN told her to take the picture. The room thought it was terrific!  If 
Mark is alive and reads this, ``It was a staged joke, Mark."  I'm sure he 
saw it: numerous people said they would send him one, or publish it 
themselves.  If any of your readers recognize themselves, or characters or 
dates or whatever here, feel free to correct or update me.
<i>((Mark is still very much around.
See below....))</i>

<p>
Yes, like one writer said, this brings to mind a million Kathy 
stories.  At least after the initial blow.  I guess this modern idea of 
``celebrating life" rather than eulogizing, has a lot to say for it.  Makes 
the whole situation a lot easier to deal with, also.

<p>
Jim,
You did a wonderful job. Everyone did. It was good
reading about the ``good old days".

<p>
I believe Kathy and Woody talked me into the 3rd
PudgeCon. The drive thru the Kansas desert was
miserable. Nothing but sand for and camels for miles.
Only the sounds of Woody's and Kathy's voices to keep me
company.
<i>((Was that an improvement????))</i>

<p>
I wish I had stories to share-I do but they are too
numerous. Things like the stab of ``the kid" at Kathy's
1st major gaming convention, Atlanticon I believe. That's
when she drew with Bill Thompson and Dan Mathias after
stabbing the kid. And rewarded her allies with a kiss. I
had to talk her into going to that con too.

<p>
The Thanksgiving Byrnecon and the beer can assault-I 
remember it well. Unfortunately Robert Sacks passed away
a while back.

<p>
Then there was the Gary Coughlan signing ``bersaglieri"
to the Mexican song ``la cucaracha", while clapping his
hands in beat.

<p>
There was the Mark Berch Dipcon, where Kathy was
on ``display" for lack of a better term. Not only did she
perform her job, but she all but stole the show.

<p>
The numerous guests who frequented our Byrnecons, too
numerous to name them all here and forget a name or 2
and be chastised for it.

<p>
The Origins and sharing a room with Dick and Julie.

<p>
The Clonecons. Meeting our 1st Midwesterners (at some
sleezy bar). Our trip out to California where Daf and
Steve put on a Dafcon for our benefit. (I wouldn't touch
the chili, but I think Kathy did).

<p>
Both Kathy and I knowing that after Cathy and Eric
met, they would marry. Yeah Eric, Kathy and I both knew
you 2 would marry. We could see it in your eyes. (Thats
Cunning and Ozog)
<i>((Yeah, a whole bunch of us were matchmaking in that
get-together, ME included.....))</i>   

<p>
Kathy really did make up names for people-like Dippy
Don for Don Ditter. Toots Michalski, Honey Olsen, and
numerous others. And you are right, the names were     
because she liked you and thought you should have a
fitting nickname. You too Greedy.

<p>
I wish to thank all of you for your well wishes. If
you want to get or keep in touch, feel free to email me.
Jim, your time for blocking for me is past. I will run
the gauntlet now for those who wish to seek me out. I
just couldn't have handled all the input that may have
happened right then.
Thanks again Jim.

Hi Jim-Bob;

<p>
Don Williams called me to tell me about Kathy.  It really caught me off
guard.  I always called her ``the old broad" because she was a month older
than me.  I suspect our next twenty years in the hobby are not going to be
QUITE as much fun as our last twenty.

<p>
My most significant memory of Kathy is more a montage.  In the 80's we were
all playing a ton of games and everybody was doing standbys for everyone
else.  It seemed like Kathy and I were always in a half dozen games
together.

<p>
We always seemed able to work with one another or blunt someone else's
attack on the other.  As much as everyone always joked about getting
``Byrned" I never did.  We privately kidded that we were mutual toadies.

<p>
I was very jealous though, because she obviously held Bob Olsen in much
higher esteem than me.

Jim,
I never met Kathy, but I was moved to tears by some of the rememberances in
<i>TAP</i> 263. It was a sweet and painful reminder that ``the game" is all about
people and personalities, and that is what sets it apart. Clearly Kathy was
one of a kind, and even though I never met her, I will miss her.

<p>
Sorry to hear of the passing of so many hobby legends in such a short
span.
Makes me wish I stayed in closer touch with the people I used to hear from
at least once a month.

<p>
<i>((Yeah, I had been keeping up with Kathy Caruso that way (through John's
baseball league) but what was really a shock is that she didn't tell
anyone.  All I saw was John acting nuttier, and nuttier, and nuttier.
[I mean that in the nicest way, John, but you do have to admit that the
flurry of midseason trading you presided over was unusual in the history
of the league!!]
We thought JOHN was the one who was sick!  But of course in retrospect
it all made sense. ))</i>

<p>
Does anyone do the <i>Zine Register</i> anymore?  Any info would be appreciated,
I'm curious what zines are out there these days.  You know I'll be back one
of the years...if just to have a reason to make Jack do a subzine again.
Any really good zines out there..besides yours?

<p>
<i>((Phil Reynolds is doing it and his szine is still out there and is
pretty good (but small).  Phil though wanted to do ONE last <b>Zine
Register</b>, figuring there wasn't much point in it anymore.  That
probably isn't that far wrong.  There are about a dozen szines
left, I'd say.  John Boardman's and Andy Lischett's are the only
ones that are resolutely NOT electronic that I know of.  And both
haven't changed a bit in a decade.  John STILL rails every issue
about Dungeons and Dragons and Christian attacks on it.  Why, I
don't really know.  He did get distracted into attacks on Harry
Potter from similar directions for awhile, but now is back into
straight D&amp;D issues.  Warren Goesle has a good szine, though it
has been suffering recently as he just got married and now (horrors!)
is about to have a baby (or his new wife is... ;-) so that one
will soon be history, unfortunately.  
[See elsewhere in this issue, the answer to how soon is now is obvious!]
Steve Koehler's szine steps
smartly along and has much better graphics than I do.  That's
probably the one you should surely start picking up again.
Also Tom Howell has an excellent little szine, featuring map
variants and he seems to have a lot of your old subbers.  So
you should see that one too.  Conrad finally folded, or folded
again, we'll see if he means it this time.))

<p>
((The Brits still have LOTS of great szines, at least I like them.
Steve Agar has yet another szine, Pete Birks sails along (recently
getting into competitive poker which strangely I find fascinating
to read about), Mark Wightman has a great szine, and I love Alex
Richardson's little szine.  Plus Mike Dean is trying the ``hobby
takeover" as being the most pushy with a webszine that still
feels like a postal szine.  He actually is a little TOO pushy
for my taste.  And I'm not mentioning all of the web szines.
The Brits are ahead there too.  Keith Thomasson has a massive
szine, but not much Dip.))

<p>
((Canadians are suffering a bit with the loss of Bob Acheson, but
Robert Lesco's szine is back and Cal White has stepped in to
continue Bob Acheson's.))</i>

<p>
Reading Linda's commentary of zines reminds me of how it was when I folded.
If it was just burnout I would have been able to handle things better, but
burnout tied with Mara's suicide attempt tied with the months of ICU care
and other medical concerns, tied with the realization that the marriage was
never going to work after that, tied with the financial disasters that these
circumstances thrust upon us sort of knocked the wind out of me.  If I could
have eliminated a couple of those things, or even just one, maybe I could
have run <i>Maniac's Paradise</i> and <i>Grand Hyatt</i> cleanly down to a fold.  But I
was so miserable and suicidal I just DIDN'T CARE anymore.  When you don't
eat for 7 days except for black coffee and Cran-Grape, and you spend every
waking hour going from a filthy house to work to the hospital, suddenly your
long-term view of things gets a little colored.

<p>
<i>((No question, we've all been feeling for you, a lot!  I'm really glad
that you are getting out of the hole finally.  Is this part above

There's a little movie spoiler below, so readers be careful...))</i>

<p>
One Hour Photo - A movie - Not as good as the hype, but still much MUCH
better than the usual movie dreck.  Robin Williams isn't as creepy as I
hoped he would be, but sufficient to keep the audience fascinated.  No
Oscar-caliber performance, but a very effective one anyway.  Go see it.

<p>
Signs - A movie - Once again, not as good as the hype.  I enjoyed the tone
of the movie, the cinematography.  The plot had its obvious points, some of
the foreshadowing I found horrendously overscripted.  I also disagreed
with the decision to EVER show the aliens.  I think it would have played better
if they were never on camera.

<p>
<i>Cherry Marmalade</i> - A new CD by Kay Hanley - Admittedly I've been in love
with Kay Hanley since I met her in Boston years ago after a Letters to Cleo
performace.  Her first solo project is a real delight.  Some of the more
hardcore LTC fans seem to find it a bit too ``poppy" but I enjoyed it quite a
bit.  Aside from <i>Wholesale Meats and Fish</i>, Kay has never let me down.  Check
out your local cut-out or used CD bin for <i>Aurora Gory Alice</i> if you forget
what LTC originally sounded like, or if you're lucky you'll find a copy of
<i>Go!</i> which was totally ignored my press and radio alike.

<p>
<i>((They've always gotten pretty good radio play around here, but I haven't heard
this new record, I'll have to pick it up!))</i>

<p>
Oh, by the way, Joe Jackson is reuniting with his original band, releasing a
new CD, and then going on tour.  If you don't care you should.

Geez, I didn't realize we were down to maybe a dozen North American
zines...for whatever reason, I just prefer paper to ezine, both in content
and attitude...but maybe that's changed these days..to be honest, for some
reason a zine in the mailbox feels different than even the same zine printed
on my printer.  I'll have to drop a few of those publishers notices, just to
see what's what...maybe the landscape is so barren even *I* can't come back

Jim-Bob,
I found another item about Kathy's past.  In one of the <i>EE</i>s, James 
Woodson asked ``Who is Ieapo Stabo?"

<p>
My answer was:  ``Ieapo Stabo is an extraterrestial who came to Earth in
1980 and lives with Kathy Byrne whom he calls his mother."

<p>
I vaguely remember that Kathy would write humor articles under this byline 
in different zines but nothing else and nothing more concrete than that.

<p>
In the ``All About Kathy" article, that was written in early 1982.  I 
know she went on to do other things in the hobby , after that, like be the 
Boardman Number Custodian (BNC) for about a year, and she was a Diplomacy World editor
with Rod Walker. I'm also thinking that she probably increased her wins in the
years following 1982 so this article shouldn't be taken as the end-all and be-all 
of her gaming career........

It's funny what people remember - I vividly remember the restaurant but 
have no recollections at all about water gun fights.
I remember the first PudgeCon when she blew in with Woody and friends 
(drove from Kansas City I believe) and basically took over.  I remember 
we all decided that there was nothing edible in Bob's refrigerator and 
Kathy decided we had to go to an Italian restaurant - a fairly nice one 
I recall - and so a dozen of us or so, all looking like the cast of 
Animal House after the toga party arrived and Kathy talked the 
management into letting us in.  Anyone who saw her operate there knows 
how she could win at Dip.  Her triumphs as Italy were purely on the 
force of her personality - she wasn't any more skilled tactically than 
anyone else - she could just simply convince anyone to do anything.  It 
is impossible to imagine her gone.

<p>
Jim-Bob,
Thanks for sending me the link for <i>TAP</i>.  Just a few personal words that I'd
like to share with your readership on Kathy.

<p>
To me, the Diplomacy hobby encapsulated the majority of the good things
about the internet before there was an internet culture. There were
certainly a lot of interesting people when I was involved. My first
encounter with Kathy was when I held MediocreCon I, with Kathy and John
calling to tell me ``Please don't laugh when you see how fat we are ... each
of us weighs about 250 pounds." Of course, Kathy was as skinny as a rail
when I opened our front door to greet her. The friendship started off with
outrageous lies from the very beginning...my parents who were never gamers
did enjoy a game of Trivial Pursuit with the Carusos and some other  
MediocreCon attendees.

<p>
Trips to Byrnecons were a big deal for Mike Barno, Jeff Bohner and myself.
Kids from upstate New York getting their first exposure to NYC (well,
Queens). The Dutch gunboat game Gary Coughlan described came to mind as one
of the most memorable moments, along with ``The Beercan Incident", picking
up Eric Kane, Rheingold Light, are all priceless memories. Of course, any
game of gunboat always degenerated into out and out board talk, with Kathy
scolding those who spoke out loud against her country with righteous
indignation! I also enjoyed her Ieapo Stabo stories, the wily alien who
would visit fellow Dippers and tell the <i>KK</i> readership about their home
lives in a most unflattering but funny manner.

<p>
Kathy's abuses at DipCons were legendary. Stabbing a 12 year old kid at
Chester PA Origins in 1981  &lt; ? &gt;  was the first I heard. The most outrageous
was her starvation tactics at Detroit Origins. She was leading a defensive
alliance against an alliance running over their side of the board, and
Kathy's side firmly supported DIAS, including Dave Perlmutter's 1 center
power. Suppertime came around and the other alliance requested a dinner
break. Kathy refused, and Robert Sacks as tournament director agreed,
stating dinner breaks only if all players agree.  Steve Arnawoodian brought
Kentucky Fried Chicken back, and Kathy and Woody shamelessly waived
chicken legs at the other side. The enemy alliance sold out for a DIAS draw     
in order to have some of their chicken!
<i>((hahahahhh!!!!  I had never heard THAT one before!))</i>

<p>
Sometime after I relocated to the Philadelphia area, my interest in the
hobby waned. The Carusos and the Courtemanches also relocated to the
Delaware Valley. It figures that after ``The East Coast Clique" unites, it
died with a whimper rather than a bang. It's just the inevitable as
people's lives, families and interests change.  Even though my contact with
Kathy and John had diminished, she was the type of person who would welcome
you with open arms and heart whenever we met.

<br /><br /><b>Rod Walker (Sunday, September 08, 2002 8:48 PM)</b>

<p>
I was really sorry to hear this.  I always liked Kathy, 
even when we were fighting ... she was always honest 
and forthright (except when playing Dip, of course).                

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Edi Birsan (Sun, 01 Sep 2002 22:45:11 -0700)</b>

<p>
Sad times recently.
The last time and the only time I played a game with Kathy was the last Diplomacy World 
invitational game that I played.     
<i>((Really?  
I remember that game very, very well, but I'm surprised to know that it was your only game
together where you had that brilliant GR alliance going and it seemed like your phone
negotiation preferences and Kathy's were matched perfectly!))</i>
In that game I had a lot of wonderful conversations and plots with Kathy as her 
Germany and my Russia rolled over the board.  
There had been two 1901 NMRs and we wanted the players to simply call the game right 
there and then as this was not what a demonstration game was suppose to be.  
There were some rather intense people there who refused so we 
crushed everyone and forced them to accept a two way draw between us.  
She was a fun person to game with and a kindred spirit for myself out of the City ((New York)).  
She was a gracious host the one time I met her and her family and 
the hobby will certainly miss her sense of humor and balance in knowing that 
it was game that could be played to win, but was still always a game.

<i>((Edi would definitely be on my all-time top board along with Kathy,
Toby Harris, Mark Fassio, and Gary Behnen
(I intentionally leave two spots vacant because I'm sure that I am leaving some people
out that I later would demand to include and adding more to that list conjures up lots
and lots of names).
Edi perhaps is unique among these five people in his complete
ability to ``rise above the fray"
and really embody that idea of how the game must be played ruthlessly to win if it is
to be played well - but also remembering that it is still just a game.
Kathy, at times, perhaps did get herself in trouble ``outside the game'' and I add
one final note from Mark Berch that captures some of that schizophrenia.
I think Mark needs to tell his story as well, though surely some of you might wish
to skip over some of it that highlights Kathy's fierce loyalty when it sometimes
caused problems.
I do think Mark's account is balanced, while also very clearly from his 
point of view.))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Mark Berch (Thu, 12 Sep 2002 10:43:39 -0400)</b>

<p>
Dear Jim,

<p>
I was very sorry to hear about the death of Kathy Caruso.  I greatly
appreciate you publishing those reminiscences, which brought back many
memories and I learned some new things too.  I want to write first on
something that wasn't much touched on, Kathy's immense impact on the hobby.

<p>
Kathy gave generously of her time to the hobby.  She was for over a year
a co-Director of the Orphan games Service, which can be an unpleasant job if
you encounter people at their worst (failing GMs, angry players). Kathy's
marvelous social skills were surely of value there. She was the Boardman
Number Custodian for well over a year, which can be a great deal of work.
She made the crucial, and difficult decision to give Boardman Numbers to
electronic mail games (then called PBEM), which had started up in <i>Dot
Happy!</i>, meaning that these games would be rated along with regular postal
games.  This somewhat controversial decision prevented hobby fragmentation,
and in my opinion, she was right on the issue and was acting for the best
interest of the hobby. She also agreed to take over at <i>DW</i> when Walker could
not handle it any longer, tho that lasted for only a few issues.

<p>
Kathy also contributed to a good number of zine fakes (including one done
of my own zine) a popular form of hobby humor in the late 70s and early 80s.
<i>((Which careful readers of last issue ALSO will have seen reborn, if
only as a one shot idea.))</i>
She sent many, many letters for publications and wrote a fair amount of
press, so she helped many zines in this way.

<p>
Special mention should be made of <i>Kathy's Korner</i>. This was the most
lively ``personalities" column the hobby had ever had (I speak here as an
archivist who was quite familiar with the hobby's literature both here and
in Britain).  It focused largely on her friends, but that was a pretty big
category! But there was never a sense of ``in group" about it.   Even if you
were new to the hobby, if you crossed paths with Kathy, you could figure on
getting teased or whatever in <i>Kathy's Korner</i>. Her column was one of the true
focal points of the hobby's personalities.  It did a particularly
entertaining job describing various cons, formal and informal that she had
been at, and gave people who couldn't possibly go a real sense of what
happened there. It's entirely possible that people were encouraged to host
one of their own after reading about them in <i>KK</i>.

<p>
Your writers, one after another, spoke of many positive interactions with
Kathy, and that was certainly the hobby norm. My interactions with her were
for the most part negative.  One of the first contacts that I had with her
was when I learned that Kathy was saying I was accusing her of rigging the
1980 Zine Poll. I finally got her on the phone.  She was very pleasant to
talk to, but she would not back down.  I asked her who it was that I was
supposedly telling this to, but she would not say, citing confidentiality!
She insisted that I had made calls to people, which was so peculiar because
I rarely used the phone for hobby business (I had only called her because
she hadn't answered my letter).

<p>
But at least that one she never put into print; other times she did.  In
the summer of 1982, Kathy resigned as co-Director of the Orphan service, and
in a letter published in <i>Appalling Greed</i>, she blasted me for opposing her
efforts to place the failing games of Glenn Overby.  I was astounded by the
accusation.  In a <i>Whitestonia</i> editorial, she complained that I was someone
trying to prevent her from naming Lee Kendter, Sr as the new BNC.  I had no
idea why she was publishing these things. Strangely, while she never
retracted the accusations, a few months would pass and I would suddenly be
back in her good graces.  It was the most tempestuous  and difficult
relationship I had in the hobby.  When things were going well, she would
publish my humor items in <i>Whitestonia</i>.  When she got pissed off at me, she
would go and publish in <i>Whitestonia</i> some letter of mine which was Off The
Record. Sometimes other people got caught up in this.  For example, at one
ByrneCon she passed around some Off The Record letters written to her by me
and Mark Larzelere told me about it.  When I wrote to Kathy about this to
complain and at least find out which letters these were, she got pissed off
at poor Larzelere. It was very odd. She'd go editorializing in her column
about how terrible it was to be labeling letters as DNQ, and yet she wrote
DNQ letters to me.

<p>
<i>((I cannot help but editorialize a bit here about how I finally rid myself
of the ``Off the Record" plague.  I declared (and still hold to) the idea that
ANYTHING written to me by or about the hobby is written to me ON the record.
If you want it to be off the record or do not quote, don't write it to me.
This has served <b>The Abyssinian Prince</b> extremely well over the years, and
may be a major reason why I am the sole surviving major 
personality oriented publisher from that period of the hobby.
This of course does not mean that I publish everything I receive, but you have to work
with my judgment and that fact.
The second thing that I thought of and still use today is the requirement that in these
pages I must be abused at least as much as any other player or person is abused.  
Technically, I could be forcing Mark Berch to abuse me as well... ;-) but let him go on.
This next part I thought long and hard about whether to print at all, but I did
in the end decide that Mark presented what he wanted to say about it in a way that
does not bring others into the story.
That seems fair, but please, let's all not dredge that singularly destructive
event back up in any extensive way.
If you want to do it, you need to attack me at least as much as you attack anyone else.))</i>  

<p>
All that changed with the ``sick letter" affair.  This was the most
sensational accusation that the hobby had ever seen, and it triggered the
most pervasive and damaging feud in hobby history. I investigated the best I
could. Kathy's flyer had said that ``proof is available to anyone". I wrote
Kathy 3 times asking for the proofs (the flyer had several other charges,
but the ``sick letter" was the most poisonous accusation).   None was ever
provided - I offered $50 for a copy of the letter - and the last of the
letters was returned to me marked ``refused", a tactic that Kathy was to use
sporadically throughout our relationship.  Kathy never described what the
letter actually said, but a number of her friends did, and their
descriptions greatly differed.  When Don Del Grande asked Kathy point blank
(in July 1985) where the letter was, she told him that she had already
answered that question to me in February 1984, which was an absolute
falsehood, and fairly bizarre, since Kathy didn't even make this charge
public till summer of 1984. Another hobbyist, whose name I no longer
remember, told me that Kathy had informed him that she had told me all about
the letter in a phone call. This too was false, although I think that the
hobbyist believed Kathy rather than me. She also told Del Grande that she
had contacted the New York Postal Authorities about me! I published updates
on this story when I could get new information. The bottom line was, once I
initially published the results of my investigation, my relationship with
her was destroyed, never to recover.

<p>
More conflicts between Kathy and myself were to follow. With one
exception, there actually wasn't much she could do to me. She castigated my
zine, but I ran no games, and only lost a handful of subbers.

<p>
The one exception was <i>Diplomacy World</i>.  Rod Walker could not put the
zine out any longer, and turned the editorship over to Kathy. I thought this
was a very good choice for <i>DW</i>, and said so in print. I was the Strategy and
Tactics editor of <i>DW</i> at the time, but Kathy refused to send me anything to
edit. And my own submissions for <i>DW</i> were returned to me unopened. I told Rod
I was going to have to resign my post because I couldn't actually do
anything in such circumstances, and Rod was able to patch this up.

<p>
But not other things. By the late fall of 1984, I became the subject of
an intense stream of accusations, invectives, and bizarre analysis of my
thought processes in <i>Kathy's Korner/Whitestonia</i> by Kathy (and John). By the
winter I was barred from responding to any of this - in fact, I was under
strict instructions not to write to either Kathy or John (except on <i>DW</i>
matters).  There was nothing I could do about this, and in fact, Kathy did
this in some other zines like <i>Politesse</i> where I wasn't always permitted to
reply either. 

<p>
I was not able to get any resolution in my conflicts with Kathy. For
example, Kathy ordinarily delighted in fakes. But when the fake <i>DW</i> #40 came
out, Kathy was enraged at me because I had contributed a piece to the fake.
I tried to point out that the piece was a story which she had already
rejected for the real <i>DW</i>.  To no avail:  Kathy began refusing my <i>DW</i> mail
again, which I had to get Larry Peery to fix, although Kathy left <i>DW</i> soon
afterward. Other irritants were to follow.
With the generally improved tone in the hobby by mid-1987, I put out a
feeler via a hobbyist who happened to be on good terms with both of us (I
still wasn't allowed to write her directly), to find out if Kathy wanted to
either try to resolve some the old conflicts, or just officially bury them
without resolution and start afresh.  The poor guy was angrily told that if
he ever mentioned my name to her again that she'd cut off his <i>Whitestonia</i>
sub. 

<p>
It just wouldn't go away. For example, what should appear in the Spring of
1989 in <i>Everything</i>, the official journal of the BNC, but a letter from
Kathy, complete with nasty name calling and labeling me as one of the two
biggest problems in the hobby. I never was able to do anything to fix
matters with her, and now I never will be able to.

<p>
Finally, note that Kathy was a consummate diplomat at both postal and
over the board play. If someone could magically reach across the decades,
across the living and the dead, and assemble a dream game of the 7 best
diplomats of all time, there, along with the likes of Walt Buchanan and Edi
Birsan, would be, playing Italy, Kathy Caruso.

John Schultz, 51, of the 600 block of Crest Drive, was riding his 2002 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle southeast on Interstate 80 near Halsted Street, police said.
Schultz had a bag and a sleeping bag tied to the passenger seat of his motorcycle, 
police said, and the load shifted while he was riding, police said.
Some of the items became entangled in the rear wheel or the belt drive system, 
causing Schultz to lose control and be thrown from the motorcycle, police said.
Schultz was not wearing a helmet, police said.
An autopsy conducted Saturday concluded Schultz died of multiple injuries from the accident.''
Please send condolences to his wife Rose Schultz at 692 Crest Dr., Valparaiso, IN  46383.))</i>

Jim -
John Schultz, our endearing ex-con? Wow. I just got orders
from him a few days ago - he was switching to a Yahoo account.
(I'll have to check my downloaded files.) DEFINITELY KEEP ME
INFORMED, PLEASE. I think I was one of the first hobby people
contacted by John - I think he got my first issue of
<i>Dipadeedoodah!</i> back in January 1989, and I've corresponded with
him ever since (though usually dictated by deadlines or
different things happening to him in prison or getting paroled).
We even talked about him coming down to Florida to see my in the
next year or two. Hard to believe.... How did you find out about
this?

me that life is all about the living and the risk taking, but

<br /><br />And now I finally get to the usual header stuff.
I decided to can the sub price increase, the postal rate increase
really is peanuts, or it seems so at the 3-5 ounce level that I live it.
So, no problem, let's keep selling subs when I can at this price.
You all know that I'm an incredible softie anyway.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
But as I said, he would prefer if most of the tributes and notes
get published here.
The future of the League of course is a bit up in the air, though
it looks like we will finish the season.
Last week John demanded (and we obey ALL his demands) that we 
attempt to behave ``normally'', so we resumed our puffed up 
touting of our teams in E-Mail chat.
But I was telling Kathy all season that I wanted to face her in
the World Series, and of course that will no longer be possible.
Kathy won three World Series in this league over the years, most
recently just last year.

He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that

Find him and win the fifty buck prize!!
You have until Issue number 265 - that's NEXT issue boys and girls!

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target

We have added a European continental representative, most of this

Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl

But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and

Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,

This is possibly the most prestigious and hard fought E-Mail
tournament around (only challenged by Doug Massey's Vermont

with FOUR full rounds.
The final players (with current SC standing, which is what
counts in a C-Diplo based tournament) are:

<p>
AUSTRIA: Jack Brawner - Find Jack at TrojanOwl of aol.com,
and he is not doing very well as I see it, but he still is
hanging on to 5 centers at the 
end of 1909.  What happens to him next??

<p>
ENGLAND: Mike Weinzimer - Find Mike at mweinzimer of yahoo.com, 
and he continues his amazing comeback back to 4 centers at the end of 1909,
but is he out of trouble?

<p>
FRANCE: Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu - Find Joe at janbu of online.no,
and he is still hanging on to 6 centers at the end of 1909 and
it looks like he is teetering between waiting to make a final
surge and collapsing under multiple attacks.
We'll find out which soon!

<p>
GERMANY: Douglas Vaughan - Find Douglas at vaughan4 of mindspring.com,
and after his surge to seven he now is collapsing down to 5 centers 
at this point, at the 
end of 1909, did his being really, really sneaky catch up to him??

<p>
ITALY: Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira - You can find Egg at egbert of salavip.com.br,
and he was eliminated at the end of 1907, poor, poor Egg....

<p>
RUSSIA: Darren Koch - You can find the Aussie Darren at koch_family of bigpond.com,
and he still is holding strong at 7 centers at the end of 1909,
and he finally has his second fleet back.

<p>
TURKEY: Frank Johansen - Find Frank at frank.johansen of diplomacy.no,
and he continues his strong move up, back to 7 centers at the end of 1909, 
as his comeback continues.

<p>
The wondrous Peter Richardson pjrich of ntlworld.com is the GM.

 The history of the WorldMasters tournament is that it is not necessarily
THE best player who wins, but the format and style seem to reward effort.
The player who works the hardest likely will win.  
Jack, Joe, and Douglas all look good at this point, with Egg out and Mike
struggling to survive.
I know lots of you can't stand C-Diplo, but that's the way it works....
I think the game goes until 1912, so there is lots more play in it, though
France looks quite strong.

``My Big Fat Greek Wedding" - a movie

<p>
Nia Vardalos wrote and created the role of Toula Portokalos.  She is 
brilliant.  The writing is so funny and her acting is so perfect that she has 
crafted a really sweet funny fine movie.  What is really remarkable is that 
she did it without a key plot element.  There is no real conflict here.  We 
expect protagonist and antagonist to make a plot work.  Forget it.
See it!  

<p>
<i>((The father and the Greek culture itself were the antagonist.... 
the Greeks invented drama, don't you think they know the rules?
And my it took you a long time to see this one. 
I've seen it twice already!))</i>

<p>
You are right about who the antagonist was meant to be, but he took a dive in 
the first and was never seen again.  There was really no conflict.  Papa was 
destroyed for about 15 seconds, and then he got over it.  Really?

<p>

``S1m0ne" - a movie

<p>
The premise that a digitally created actor can be made so real that she 
becomes a star isn't that hard to believe.  There is a whole lot of digital 
work being done now to make actors a bit more buff, a bit more attractive, 
appear to do their own stunts.  How hard is it to go to the next step?  The 
computers are there.  Can the programs be far behind?

<p>
The story is a bit thin.  They chose a drop dead gorgeous person for `Simone' 
and Al Pacino always delivers an excellent role, but I really never saw why 
`Simone' was such a popular phenomenon.  Because the script said so has never 
carried a whole lot of weight.

<p>
Still, funny at times, and Al Pacino...  Worth a look.

``One Hour Photo" - a movie

<p>
Mark Romanek as writer and director gets all the credit for as fine a bit of 
audience manipulation as I have ever seen.

<p>
The movie starts with Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) under arrest and awaiting 
questioning.  The audience knows that he has done something but there is no 
clue exactly as to what, except that he took photos, and the photos are now 
evidence.

<p>
Sy's lawyer hasn't arrived yet, and the detective cautions him that he 
doesn't have to answer, but that he has just one question.  ``Why?"

<p>
The rest of the movie is Sy's explanation.  Sy is a little nebbish of a man. 
He has no life beyond the photo lab he runs in a Savemart.  His boss doesn't 
like him because Sy costs Savemart too much in his attempts at the perfect 
print.  Sy has no family, no friends, no interests other than his hobby.  

<p>
His hobby?  He is a stalker.  He has been stalking one family from a great 
distance.  He stalks them through their family photos.  One entire wall of 
his apartment is dedicated to all of their photos down through the years.

<p>
He loves these people.  He imagines himself as part of their family.  He's 
`Uncle Sy'.  Then almost at the same moment he loses his job and he discovers 
that the husband in his perfect family has been cheating on his wife.

<p>
Sy goes a little more insane at that point.

<p>
Really outstanding visual presentation throughout.  If I have to pick a 
weakness it is in the photos taken by young Jake (Dylan Smith).  They didn't 
look like pictures taken by a nine year old.  They looked like pictures taken 
by a professional photographer who knew that they would all appear in a 
feature film, and who wanted every shot to be imaginative, colorful, and 
perfectly composed.

``Ballistic : Ecks vs Sever" - a movie

<p>
Definitely a `B' movie.  Long on action, short on plot.  In fact the stories
have such huge holes that you just have to ignore them and let the action
carry the show.

<p>
I have no idea where the title came from.  ``Postal: Ecks and Sever against
the bad guys" was probably too long, but lots closer to what it was about.

<p>
Gregg Henry as `Robert Gant' the villainous super agent shadow government guy
who pulls all the strings from NSA through FBI down to local law enforcement
was lots of fun.  He sneers and smiles so evilly.  The character was such a
terrible person you have to wonder why his faithful gang didn't just blow him
away, first.  He certainly didn't mind getting any of them killed.

<p>
Antonio Banderas as `Jeremiah Ecks' tried to make more of the role than was
really there.  He can actually act.  But it doesn't matter in this case.

<p>
Lucy Liu as `Sever' was most of the show.  She is fantastic whether knocking
down the bad guys with her martial arts, or taking them out with her trusty
grenade launcher.       

<p>
Best line in the movie.  She is showing Ecks her arsenal and he asks where
she got all the ordinance.  ``Some women buy shoes," was her response.

<p>
She was a trained assassin, raised from infancy to be a weapon, without
compassion or morality (at least that's what the movie claimed).  She was
Gant's tool to remove obstacles.  When she took time out to have a baby he
decided that the child would be a distraction, and so had it killed.

<p>
Just how intelligent is it to piss off a killing machine?

<p>
Still, great action.

Jim-Bob,
As I write it is 48 hours before the MLB strike deadline.  From here it 
looks like:
1)  There will be a strike.
2)  It will be short.
3)  It won't solve a darned thing.

<p>
Oh, maybe they'll address drug/steroid use, and maybe there will be a 
luxury tax, but there won't be any major changes.  The Yankees will 
still be able to buy all the free agents they want, and all the free 
agents that the Red Sox want too.  They're talking about a revenue 
sharing plan that will be in the $250M range.  If so, that's still over 
$1B short of what it needs to be.  And my plan just sits on a shelf 
collecting dust.  Sigh.

<i>((I thought the same thing, that there might be a very short strike,
but then we didn't.
And I disagree with you, I think the move is significant, more significant
than you do.... it may not stop the Yankees, but even a billion wouldn't
have stopped the Yankees and it would have bankrupted the Red Sox.))</i>

<p>
Jim-Bob,
I just found this on ESPN's Useless Information Dept:

<p>
``Kip Wells just became the Pirates' first 12-game winner in three years 
(since Todd Ritchie did it in 1999). In that period in which the Pirates 
had no 12-game winners, the Yankees had eight."

<p>
Feel free to comment on baseball's inequities.

<p>
<i>((Goz, I will..... strike settled.... let's see what it does, it will
have SOME effect.
Pirates front office stinks.... see Oakland that has three pitchers with more
than 12 wins with the same size payroll....))</i>

<p>
Of COURSE it will have SOME effect.  Joe Torre will get to earn another job
managing next year's AL All-Stars.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Goz, wgoesle of core.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((That's not an ``effect'', and Joe Torre ain't managin' no
2003 All Stars....
Go, Oakland, you will note I predicted THEM to win the West and I
think get into the World Series.... may they win 30 straight!!!
The Yankees are badly flawed without Rivera and with those starting
pitchers.  Admittedly, when they retool the pitching staff next year
they will do it faster than anyone else can, but who'd a thunk that
they'd go belly up for lack of middle relief.  Torre doesn't think 
he has ANY help in the middle innings and he's gonna kill his starters.
Did you see what he did to Mussina yesterday?  Made him come back after
100 pitchers and a 1.5 hour rain delay!!!))</i>

I actually have a contribution to the music sections. 
As usual, it's rather different from your usual offering. 8-)
<i>((Maybe reading it will help convince Goz and his new wife and baby

<p>
The Wiggles, Live! is the name of the show, which my wife, kids and I took in. 
For those readers without small children, The Wiggles is a group of four 
Australian children's entertainers, along with various sidekicks, and is 
apparently wildly popular in Oz. (Loath as I am to admit it, I enjoy their TV 
show and tapes too...)

<p>
They have been making a North American tour for most of the summer, with sold-
out shows everywhere they go. On August 27 they had two shows at the Molson 
Amphitheatre at Ontario Place in Toronto. The one-hour show had masses of 
toddlers dancing in their seats to all of their favourite songs and banter. The 
audience gleefully participated in helping to ``wake up" Jeff (the purple-
shirted one) and Captain Feathersword.

<p>
The group also had something for the parents, in which the Captain had to sing 
his signature tune, which goes like ``Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack-cock-a-
doodle-doo", to various songs like ``Bohemian Rhapsody", Celine Dion's Titanic 
song, ``Start Me Up", Teletubbies, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and a few others. 
All in all, it was an enjoyable show for all. The ``stroller park" employees are 
the unsung heros, as they managed to safely store and extract about 900 
strollers for each show.

<br /><br /><b>Harry Andruschak (Fri, 30 Aug 2002 07:42:38 EDT)</b>

<p>
Well, after 15 years of renting a bedroom from my landlady for $500/month, I 
am moving. She has sold the 3 bedroom house, and I am required to be out by 
Sunday 15 September. The new owners arrive Monday 16 September. I paid my new 
apartment manager, Martha Buls, $720 for the first month's rent. I will be 
paying all utilities. She showed me the apartment. It was a mess, courtesy of 
the previous tenants. She assured me that it would be cleaned up by Saturday 
14 September so that I could start moving in. I would prefer not to have such 
a tight deadline, but there it is.

<p>
But it is a comfortable apartment. Not fancy, but neither a hovel. I've 
already met some of my new neighbors, they seem a sedate bunch. Some have 
been living here for over 30 years. The apartment manager likes quiet 
stability, the tenants like quiet stability, and I like quiet stability. If 
all goes well, this is where Pearly and I will live together, and die. End of 
the line. Even if I get out of Chapter 13 in three years, my credit is ruined 
forever, and I will never be able to finance a home, condo, or even a mobile 
home. So this is the end.

<p>
It has a large bedroom, larger then what I am living in now. Small kitchen, 
ideal for a bachelor like myself. A substantial living room, a small but 
fully equipped bathroom, and a small room that could be a den or a guest 
bedroom. For now it will be Pearly's ``safe room", where she will stay while 
the rest of the move is in progress, and maybe for a few days afterwards as 
she settles down.

<p>
Harry Andruschak, 734 W. 214th Street, Apartment 12-A,
Carson, CA 90745.

<p>
 yes, the apartment complex has apartments 12, 12-A, and 14. No 13. Of 
course, Apartment 12-A should really have been 13, but you know how 
superstitious some people are. I'm not, so I asked Chuck Nimitz, the guy who 
cleans and maintains the apartment complex, if I could have the number 
changed to 13. He said he would check with Martha about that. 

<p>
My brother and my nieces will help with the move on 14/15 September, which is 
after all only a few blocks from where I currently live. My landlady decided 
to sell me some of the leftover furniture. It is quite shabby, but she made 
me an offer of $250 for a sofa, a few chairs, several lamps, tables, 
microwave oven, and other assorted stuff. Shabby but functional, and I hope 
the Chapter 13 Trustee and Judge will both find this an acceptable use of 
funds. 

<p>
Shabby but functional seems to sum up my current Chapter 13 lifestyle anyhow. 
And of course I will still be able to attend all the AA meetings I have 
established myself at for the last 15 years.

<p>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly.
You also can sign up for the next Breaking Away game, which is starting now.
Tom Howell currently is signed up, knock off the superstar, come on,
you can do it!!
So far, Eric Brosius wants to challenge Tom.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Harold Reynolds is willing to start a game of Colonia and one of Aberration.
I think the signup list for Colonia includes me, David Hood, Paul Rauterberg,
David Partridge, and (Yes, really!!) Konrad Baumeister.
That means we only need four more.
In the meantime, Konrad, Paul, and David are playing a ``demo game''.
I'll try to get a web address for it in here next time.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper is the only one signed up for that.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BOOB to WORLD): Looks like everyone is complaining and no one is coordinating.
Shall we just declare a seven way draw or are you guys planning to play??  ;-)
We'll let you all have your say next....

<p>
(FOOL): Sorry, this has just been a lousy week, beginning with illness
which resulted in me writing various bits of Diplomacy while drugged,
followed by the first round of layoffs at my company (as it turns out I
survived), and finished off by a good friend winding up in the hospital.

<p>
(BOOB to FOOL): Would it be too low a blow to ask whether anyone can
tell the difference between the regular you and the drugged you?? ;-0

<p>
(RUSSIA): I am overwhelmed by the non-entity that is Turkish diplomacy. 
Perhaps I'm secretly hoping that Tim will NMR...?

<p>
(FOOL): Oh, and please remember to use mehkeri of neon.polkaroo.net;
alternately I've also got a yahoo account fool1901 of yahoo.ca if you don't
want to remember how to spell my last name or if the word ``Polkaroo"
brings back bad memories.

<p>
(BARON to MY PET ROCKS): That's it. I'm done. No more
wracking my brains trying to entertain you bunch.
When's the last time someone tried to entertain me in
this game? 

<p>
Actually, Tim used to entertain me regularly with his
always earnest promises to write me a real letter,
``just as soon as I finish studying for this mid-term."
Little did I realize that Tim is majoring in Mid-Term.
And it's an eight-year program. Silly me to stab him
right before his break. Heck, I bet he cut down his
class load to 18 credits or so this summer. But he
probably used up all that extra free time by teaching
himself how to blink again. 

<p>
I had to blink back the tears of joy when Dan sent me
an actual letter at the start of the game. But since
then, all I've gotten from him is, ``Sorry I didn't
write you at all this season. I was swamped at
work/had a cold/forgot what country I was playing."
But hell, I can just read that one letter over and
over again. It's due back from the frame shop on
Monday. I think it was worth the extra money to spring
for the gilt edging. 

<p>
I'm going to hang it over my computer so I have
something to read when my e-mail is empty. Though
sometimes when I see I have an e-mail from Rick, I
wish it had stayed empty. An e-mail from Rick is like
a knock on the door by a Jehovah Witness. You think,
``Gee, it sure is considerate of him to show my welfare
such concern," but you know if you open the door and
let him in, he's going to be staying a long time.

<p>
Of course, not as long as it takes a posted letter to
make it from Australia. Closing in on eight months
now. I guess mail tends to get lost in the Dreaming.
Maybe I should hire an aboriginal guide to lead me to
Waterloo and Woollahra. He'd probably laugh at me. For
all I know, Waterloo and Woollahra are the Australian
equivalent of a Snipe Hunt.

<p>
It didn't take the Archbishop long to hunt up a new
France. Thank God for Doug. I was beginning to worry
that every other game in TAP would have someone
sharing morbid accounts of death and dying except for
good ol' ICFMM. After reading Doug's first e-mail, my
worries were no more. Now we finally fit in!

<p>
I just hope I can fit in this shell I just bought. You
guys all look so comfy in yours, I had to get one for
myself. Have the Archbishop knock on it when we call
the EG draw. And if I don't see my shadow when I poke
my head out, I might even take a moment to mutter, ``So
long, and thanks for the fun game."

<p>
(FRANCE - ALL): Diplomacy is a remarkable game.  Seven powers, each with their
own regional positives and negatives, grapple for supremacy over Europe
having only their tactical and diplomatic skills as weapons.  That is,
unless two of the powers are in bed with each other before they even sign up
for the game.  Then the game becomes less like a battle of wits and skill,
and more like cheating at solitaire.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Goz resigns with these orders.
See Goz's statement in the press, he actually writes the most press
and then resigns.
Sean O'Donnell is appointed to replace him.
Thank you, Sean, for volunteering to standby!!

<p>
2) Jack also NMR's and I'm calling Kevin Wilson as a standby.
Jack has to get back to me BEFORE the Winter deadline with 
tentative Spring orders or the standby replaces him.
Thanks, Kevin, I know you just asked to go on the list.
I hope we don't actually have to use you.
I don't think I have your phone number, do I?
If so, I cannot find it.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EDINBURGH-MOSCOW): This move might not have been smart, but it was just a lot
more interesting.  If it bombed, I'll be out of your way anyway.

<p>
(THE BRUCE-POPE): Poor choice of words on my part.  My apologies.  

<p>
(EDINBURGH-PARIS): Back on track?

<p>
(BOOB to EDINBURGH): Perhaps a bit TOO much back on track?
Or maybe that was the plan to shift resources.

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA):  Ok, I wrote, twice in fact, in between job searches.  
And what thanks do I get?  No phone call, no post card, no email, no 
carrier pigeon.  Nada.  Zip.  Zilch.  And you gave my seat at the poker 
table to Kent for what?

<p>
(ITALY to ENGLAND): You got your ``no-lose" situation. But I think it may end
up being a ``no-win" situation for you in the end.

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE):  I can't get much out of you, so I thought I'd visit 
in person.  Need a friend?

<p>
(ITALY to FRANCE): Don't worry, I'm not ``attacking" you. We're just having a
``staring contest" in Spain.

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND): Need a friend?

<p>
(ITALY to RUSSIA): I'll be really surprised if you didn't attack me this
time. Let's see if you can keep those gains.

<p>
(BOOB to JODY): He didn't attack ANYONE this time.

<p>
(EDINBURGH CASTLE-MOSQUE HIGH ATOP CONSTANTINOPLE): Your patience is starting
to look really smart.  You can sweep in behind either of two fights.
Completely Useless By September yet again.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ENGLAND): Jack ``Sack" McHugh and I wrote an article for issue 85 of
Diplomacy World (www.diplomacyworld.org) entitled ``How To Lose Friends and
Irritate People''.  I suggest you go read it, and then apply that strategy to
Sackiepoo.  Write him a letter explaining that you worship the Philadelphia
Eagles and you have 4 children all named McNabb.  Send him a bottle of the
most obscure micro-brew beer you can find.  Send him an anonymous email
revealing that Warren Goesle is really Garret Schenck with a decent shave.
If that doesn't work, try threats - tell Sackie that if he doesn't agree to
a 2-way with you, you'll set up a 1-800 line attached to his home number
and let Tretick think its the toll free hotline for the Bernie Oaklyn fan
club.  Now, as Homer Simpson says, let's give toast to alcohol: the cause
of, and solution to, all of life's problems.

<p>
(BOOB to DOUGIEPOO): Hahahahah!!!! Absolutely, I'll drink to that!!!                                           

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB):  You're not STILL holding out hope for the Red Sox, are 
you?  What am I saying?  Of COURSE you are.  You still think they'll 
beat Cincinnati in '75, and the Mets in '86.  You still believe that 
people other than Joe Torre might manage the AL All-Stars next year.  
You still think that teams like the Royals have a fair shot at a 
pennant.  That's what I admire in you Jim:  blind loyalty.  Oh, to have 
you as an ally in a Dip game...
<i>((You might not say that if you actually experienced it.... but yes,
I am a fan and that is the definition.  
Fans live and die on Yogi Berra's famous words ``It ain't over til the fat lady sings.''
As I write, the Red Sox have been eliminated from the East Division race, so yes
the Yankees win that again.
But the magic number for the wild card remains at one, which means they have to
win them all and the Angels have to lose them all.
The Red Sox won again today on Saturday and have Pedro going tomorrow.
It ain't over yet.... and finally after all that other press comes
Goz's resignation speech....))</i>

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): My life is moving on again, and so must I.  
I'm still unemployed, but I now have a job offer in the works, 
and it requires me to move again.  
I now have to do that with a wife who is due to give birth soon, and who 
wants me to spend my time on pursuits other than Diplomacy.
As such, I must resign from the game.  Too bad, as I was enjoying it 
immensely.  But I'm sure you can find someone equally sarcastic to take 
over the spot.
Don't think that I won't still write you every year and tell you that 
the Yankees will win the World Series though.
Take care.
<i>((Take care to you too.
We'll miss you!
I do need some help to rehouse Goz's games.... since he also is folding his
szine.
I'd be willing to take some of them.))</i>

<p>
1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed
and with all of this with Kathy Byrne Caruso I still didn't have a chance
to do the final Endgame chart.
You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<p>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and would like
to volunteer to guest GM a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next ``big'' game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, could Harold give me an exact count
of how many are signed up?
Also, Harold is running a test game with Konrad Baumeister, Dave Partridge
and Paul Rauterberg
that you can watch on his website (I'll give you a link when you get going).
It's possible this won't start until the test game is finished.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FRET and FREGT draws are rejected again and both the
FRET and FREGT draws are reproposed.
Please vote again with your Spring orders.
Generally you need to vote again unless you insist to me that
a vote you have made wants to be perpetual.
A failure to vote may not veto a draw.
I have noted that I don't have a specific rule about calling
a draw with no movement.
You just play on, BUT what I am doing is calling on my rule
for allowing failure to vote on the draws counting as a ``yes''.
This is done with warning.
Starting now, you have to vote EVERY season
or your no vote or failure to vote becomes a ``yes''.
Initially this will NOT count those of you who have given me 
perpetual draw votes, but after another period of no movement,
everyone will have to vote on the draws every season.
At this time, I am not warning you about this.  I will do so
with at least a few seasons notice.

<p>
2) I've had requests about ``speeding up'' the game.
This is certainly possible, but it only can be done 
with the permission of all players.
Thus, I'm not sure it matters in this situation, but feel free to 
tell me that your orders for future seasons are good for a quicker 
run of seasons.  We could sail through a game year every other issue
if you want.
At this time, I have at least one player who did not give me Spring
orders to be used with this deadline.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
See the top of the szine at the end of the Kathy Caruso Memorial Section
for more details on John's death. 
This has been a weird year, hasn't it?

<p>
3) That goes for the rest of you who NMR'ed as well.
Though you all are free to move units in the Fall.

<p>
4) Note Harry's new postal address.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(KARL - HARRY):  What threat?  I never actually asked anyone to nuke you, or even 
mentioned it to anyone outside of that press item.  I just figured it made sense.
And, you see, even I didn't attack any of your centers with my nukes.  Is it 
really that hard being on top?  Glad I'm way down here.

<p>
(PAUL to HARRY):  There.  I didn't nuke a single home dot.

<p>
(KENDTER to ANDRUSCHAK): Hmmm....  You don't like people to hold
grudges, but you announce your plans to screw me over?
I am satisfied with my revenge on Kenny for the first year.
I WAS going to revenge vs.&nbsp;Schultz for the first year, but you have
annoyed me more recently.
I hope you enjoy glowing in the dark.

<p>
(ITALY - EUROPE):  Sadly, we do have nuclear capability.  Even sadder, we are 
forced to use it on those nations more powerful than we.  Saddest of all, that's 
pretty much everyone.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
2) I delayed the Spring turn of this game. 
I did have orders from John that I am passing on to Kurt Ozog, who I have asked
to take over for John.  See above at the end of the Kathy Byrne Caruso memorial
section for more on John Schultz.
I really hope that is the end of this sequence, like all of you I have had more
than enough.
Let's end this issue with a quote from the Mekons....

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``It makes no difference, all that work and stuff;
I know that there's a place, when things start getting rough.
Throbbing so hard, like a funeral march.... kick away the chair.''
From ``The Road to Florida" which may be found on the highly anti-Reagan/Thatcher
1987 album <i>So Good It Hurts</i>.
John Schultz was planning a road trip to Florida sometime, but he never made it.
Bye, John, we'll always remember you....

<p>
