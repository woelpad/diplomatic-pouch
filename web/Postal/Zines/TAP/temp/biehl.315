Jim,
      My orders are; A Ank - Arm, F Smy hold, F Bla - Bul (ec), F WMed - 
Spa (sc), F TyrS S Aus A Nap - Rom &  F Tun - NAf.
      My votes are; GIRF draw - No, GT draw - Yes, FAIRT draw - No, 
Recall Tallman - Yes.
      My Proposals are; 1) AEIT draw and  2) Expulsion of 
Ozog/Replacement player for Ger (Reason: Tallman is ambulatory & should 
have resumed play much earlier).
       Press: (Constantinople Apr 1, 1907) Sultan Hatas I announced the 
cancellation of the projected Berlin - Constantinople Railway. " We 
cannot, alas, support this German scheme. We Ottomans must defend our 
realm unlike the cowardly Germans who scourge all weak nations yet have 
not the courage to oppose the strong."
