(Sean-Jim-Bob): No Problem. It's fine there.

(Sean-Jim-Bob part 2): That's true. I'm just voicing something that I'd be 
trying to guess. I thought based on his moves that he'd remove pressure off 
France to try shifting Jeff to attack Germany. I guessed wrong on what I 
thought he might be removing. It's part of the intrigue of the game for me. 
I enjoy trying to guess what a player is going to be doing sometimes I guess 
wrong sometimes I guess right. I don't worry about the words as I said in 
the winter press; I won't completely put my stock into words; especially, 
since Diplomatics is my weakspot. Which sucks because I been letting my 
diplomacy influence my strategy lately. I think that's a critical error on 
my part. For me, it's just part of the game. At least, I wasn't completely 
off base, but I did guess completely wrong cause I voted for the first two 
not the second, but I can see I was in the ballpark.

(Sean-Jim-Bob part 3): What was Jeff guessing? Good question. Specifically 
like what I did guessing what units he was going to remove?

(Sean-World): I'm with Jeff. I'm sure David would have to pay full price for 
landing on Boardwalk with a hotel on it even if David had a value of 100 
dollars. Heck, I'd be hoping Jeff landed on every property I own eventually 
he'd go bankrupt. I honestly don't see a difference between family playing 
together vs persay Terry Tallman and Eric Ozog playing in the same game 
together. I'm sure they'd act on their own interests as well.

    from Sean

     Jim,

    Jeff thought he was playing conservative, so his guess was he'd remove 
two off each front. I have no idea if it made a difference with what he 
built. I wouldn't have changed my build regardless what I thought Karl was 
doing. I'm a conservative builder. I'd rather build safe in that situation 
than gamble besides a fleet is a year out of the war really.

I wrote the personnal note wrong. Jeff said he might remove a unit off each 
front, but I don't think it would have effected Jeff's build. Personally, 
I'd removed two off Germany, so I could still hope to pull a afait accompli 
against France. England is definitely sunk now. I'd be amazed if England 
survives in my opinion. I been wrong before though.

Scratch my original press I forgot what I wrote for them, so I'll rewrite 
them here:

(Sean-Jim-Bob): I'm not sure if I follow you, but maybe this will help you 
see what I'm doing. As though I was Turkey:
F Tys-Ion
F Ion-Apu
F Rom-Tus
F Blk S A Bul-Rum
A Bul-Rum
A Rum-Bud
A Alb-Tri
A Ser S A Alb-Tri
F Con-Aeg
A Ank-Con.
     I'm figuring that Fred is likely to be ordering:
A Mos-Sev
A Ukr S A Mos-Sev
A Gal-Rum
A Bud S A Tri
A Tri S F Adr-Alb
F Adr-Alb
     Now, I look and see how I fared. For the fall, I'll look at what I'd do 
as Turkey with what Alexander did do. In S09, I'll flip it and see how I'd 
fare against Alexander.

(Sean-Board): I agree with Jeff. I honestly don't see how Kurt and Eric 
Ozog, Jeff and I, or Jim and David Burgess playing together in the same game 
is any different than Eric Ozog and Terry Tallman playing in the same game. 
We're playing to win, so I don't understand how it matters.

      Personal note: There's more to the story. I can't do what I normally 
do since I'm the middleman with France and Germany. So, it leaves me trying 
to guess what Karl is doing. I prefer to pick a side and see how I fare, but 
I have a gust of what F/G is planning.. Defeats the purpose of the excercise 
don't you agree?

So, what I'm thinking Karl will do is:
Nwg-Nor
Nth-Hel
Bel-Nth
Ech S Bel-Nth
Bur-Mun
Ruh S Hol-Kie
Hol-Kie

       Theoratically, I think he'll see Por as a lost cause since he 
afterall removed Por, and he's likely to believe Ber is supporting Mun. I'd 
place a force of one at least into Nor, so Germany can't walk in, and I 
think Karl is likely to believe Hel is the one providing support to defend 
Kie.

      from Sean
