<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.  
Come to TempleCon and then go to 
World DipCon in Chicago in August, we can overwhelm Shark Chum with 330 warm bodies!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue codifies the next step of the szine/subszine inversion.  As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug will keep us on schedule so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

Thanks Jim- I bought the latest Mekons album <i>Ancient &amp; Modern 1911-2011</i> 
and it's good.  
Most of the songs have a folk sound to it, except for the killer second track 
"Space in Your Face", which rocks!. 
Overall, it's a much better album than their previous effort <i>Natural</i>.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Everyone seems re-engaged, thanks!  We know we have the Syracuse
fans here, so my condolences on the loss of the unbeaten season,
literally as I was typing in these adjustments I looked up and there
was Notre Dame upsetting the 'Cuse.
But that didn't generate any press.
I have some old press that was written six months ago, hope it's ok
that I dug it out and printed it.
And also some newer press.... you can figure out which is which.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE):  Ours not to reason why, ours just to get
swallowed up by the breach and get annihilated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(YELLOWSTONE VETERAN to SMOKEY THE BEAR):  Sometimes if you "stop,
drop, and roll," you end up not escaping the flames but just getting
covered with bear scat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 13 (Dark Press –- not for attribution) AIN'T DEAD YET):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I glanced at my watch; 3:29...
I TAP'ed it a couple of times, but the second hand kept plugging 
along like the horse you had just bet the milk money on.  
Slow, but sure...but slow.  
The dame leaned in to look over my shoulder, I didn't so much see her, 
as feel the heat go up a couple of notches on my thermostat.  
She smacked her gum.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Watsa' mattah?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I thought it had stopped, but it seems to be working again..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Virgule, the monk, intoned solemnly on my right, "Even a stopped watch 
is right twice a day."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I shot him a snarl, which has a requisite curl to the lip, 
but just on the one side of the mouth, and a raspiness of voice;  
"Really?  So, do you write the fortune cookies, or just read them?"   
I'd dropped the eyebrow for a chaser of disdain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Virgule's oriental inscrutability left him bulletproof to sarcasm; disdain and all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The dame gave the XAT Heuer and it's marching second hand an appraising look; 
"It ain't dead yet.  So's if it don't keep good time, whaddya' hold onto it for?  
Does it have like a sentimental value to youse?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Only if sentimental is the five bucks you can get when you hock it.  
Leverage that into a bottle of Cheater's and you've got a whole day of 
potential. Makes me all misty eyed just thinking about it."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So's it's not like a family heirloom or somesuch."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Naw, it's the some such.  
Got it out of Burgess' bureau drawer when I was looking for a clean pair of socks."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The blonde's brow furrowed and she leaned in even closer, my pulse tried to catch up to the second hand, but couldn't see to run through the perfume.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"He didn't mind?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"About the socks?  He hates that."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So's you tellin' me you took Burgess' watch and you expected it to keep good time?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, just for deadlines, retreats, Winter builds...you know.  
It's not like I'm playing Ticket to Ride." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The dame sat back, the air pulled into the vacant space between us 
was substantially cooler and less well formed, though her perfume 
still wafted, which is one gay ass word when you think about it.   
Wafted, like you're supposed to be rafting, but on the wind, or walking, 
but lightly in the air.   Which brings to mind whiff.  You can catch a 
whiff of something; not the whole nose smell, but the discount loss 
leader of aroma.  Just the smidgeon of it tickling your olfactory senses...
which means you could whiff the waft.  Which seems counter-intuitive somehow, 
because waffles don't strike me as gay, or even that light...
maybe more ethnic, the whole waffles and chicken thing...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>"Hullo!"</b>  The dame was staring at me, a look of concern in her eyes.  
I was almost touched...she could do better.  "Youse okay dere?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah," I answered, "just thinking."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"And dey said dis story didn't have dangerous plot twists," 
retorted the dame.  "So what wuzzit youse were thinking?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That actually, I've never been struck by a waffle, gay or otherwise..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The blonde sat silent for a moment as she chewed and digested this last 
morsel of information and pursed her lips in thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse not the brightest Private Eye in the Hobby are youse?"   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I picked my fedora up off the counter, and placed in on my head 
with a practiced nonchalance.  I know, because I have practiced.   
I shot her my self assured look of competence and cocksuredness 
(which some don't think is a word),  and answered.
"I'm the only Private Eye in the Hobby."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />Outside the <b><i>Diplomatic Paunch</i></b> the day was well on its way, where to I 
wasn't sure, but it seemed to be plodding apace. The breeze was blowing 
in off the Sea of Press, sweeping the streets free of the detritus of 
broken promises and failed ploys and the other toxic castoffs of the hobby.  
It gave the air a crisp clean feel, the guileless charm of sincerity, 
a baby's trusting smile, a brand new shiny knife.  
It reminded me of summers spent camping up in the Yellowbacks, 
somewhere west of the Hobby.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse having a flashback?" asked the dame.   She popped her gum in punctuation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I squinted one eye and looked around.  
Most flashbacks occur in black and white, which can be tricky in press. 
Hard to tell the difference...which is why I always look for the italics.  
Which isn't meant to be bigoted, some of my best friends are italics...
and the food, you gotta love the food.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i> "Then we can catch the Red car East and transfer to the White Line...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 A newsboy on the corner was waving a paper in the air;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Read all about it! Hierophant goes Missing!  Missing and Silent!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 `I don' think you can transfer at Galicia and 52nd,' she said, 
eyeing the faded map.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 `What do you want to do, walk across the Hobby?' "</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Red Car," I said, "we have to catch the Red Car."   
The dame fell into step with me as we headed down the sidewalk.  
I didn't look back, but I was sure the chink was right behind us, 
and I couldn't help but have the nagging feeling that someone was behind him.   
It wasn't like we blended in.  The dame was in a shimmery red sarong, 
the monk wore his long flowing robe...heck, I was the only one clad 
in normal clothes.  Fedora, trench coat, tightly clenched cigarette 
in my jaw; who doesn't wear that?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Call it the itch between the blades, cross-hair fever, or the 
feeling you get when your markers been sold to the Weasel gang 
and Shark Chum's been sent to collect...call it what you want, 
but it wouldn't go away.  I even tried the old trick of trying to catch 
reflections in the zine windows as we walked by, but we were 
in the older part of the Hobby when the zines had been mimeographed.  
The print smudges were so bad it had come off everywhere, 
the windows so grimed that they cast shadows, not reflections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Shadows...thought I heard a laugh at that, must have been my internal dialog. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It turns out you could transfer at Galicia and 52nd.  
Though I don't remember that many Trattorias being there last time I was here.  
Could of sworn there'd been a Bierhaus on the corner.  
Now it was ristorantes with checkered tablecloths outdoors 
and an organ grinder and his monkey.  
And I didn't like the way the monkey was looking at me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I looked down at Burgess' XAT Heuer on my wrist, it still read 3:29, 
we were making good time.  
I TAP'd  a couple of Red Kings out of the pack, 
one for me, one for the dame.  
Which left it empty, the chink was on his own.  
Though he probably preferred opium...just sayin'.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I fished the matches out of my pocket, couldn't recall where I'd picked them up.  
They had the name "Eternal Sunshine" emblazoned over a cartoon sun, 
but I didn't frequent tanning salons, so didn't figure 
I'd gotten them first hand.  It didn't seem like Eternal 
Sunshine was a good name for a bar...which eliminated a lot 
of my list of suspects. Not that it mattered, a match by any other name...  
I flared one up and lit the two fags and passed one off to the dame.  
She inhaled like a trooper and I watched the rise and fall of the 
empire, so to speak.  
Something about big breasts, cigarette smoke and blonde hair...and big breasts.  
A charge of the light brigade all to itself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tram for the White line pulled up with a screech of 
metal on metal brakes that sounded like the fishwife 
who finds her husband sleeping on the stoop in the morning.  
The doors hissed open and as we got on I absently tossed the 
empty pack of Red Kings at the trash bin by the lamp post.  
A gust of wind kicked up and I missed.  
The pack hit the rim and bounced over, onto the sidewalk, 
but the tram door was closing.  Screw it, write me a ticket.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As the tram pulled off in a huff and lurch mambo dance of 
public transportation I saw the organ grinder's monkey scuttle 
up to the empty pack like it was catnip for simians.  
Poor furry bastard probably thought there was still a butt in it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The White line goes back into the old neighborhoods of the Hobby. 
The tram trundled past Pontevedria, and I looked out at zines 
I had never seen before, never even heard of. There were 
fewer and fewer riders as we went along, and the zines were older, 
less well kept up, many just vacant and abandoned. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tram hitched and jerked to a stop.  The driver got up and stretched expansively.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"End of the line folks, Bahnhof Zoo."

1) Now, we would like to see some more endgame statements if we could, I've
printed the full game SC chart and would like to print more endgame statements
in the next issue.
I think Bruce also is going to say that he is retiring from Diplomacy
with this game (I hope he doesn't).

What a strange standby position this was.  I got called to take over
for a spot that looked like I would have no choice at all and would
just take some stalemate line position and sit still until a big draw
passed.  Instead I got to go on a grand tour of about nine new supply
centers, own every home center of the eventual winner, and get a piece
of the strangest win you'll ever see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I came in thinking I would be part of an
all-western-powers-gotta-get-together-to-stop-an-eastern-leader
alliance, dull but necessary.  As it happened, my late brother Phil
and I had a disagreement about how to handle hobby disagreements,
nothing to do with this game.  I made some move just to aggravate him,
he overreacted, and he decided the western alliance didn't need me.
So I was determined to prove him wrong.  Sure enough, his alliance
lost without me, and I survived.  Along the way, I took far more
supply centers from the Turkish leader than Phil ever could hope to.
Eventually I took most of the Austro-Hungarian centers, most of the
Balkan centers, and every Turkish center.  If I never got to hold more
than the one I was in, well, that was more than the
alliance-without-me ever owned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the end, my only real agreement was mutually honored, and I got to
be an active part of an historic ending.  If I had to take a loss, it
was the loss that those who
wanted to dump me suffered themselves.  Congratulations to
Bruce for (as Jim noted) a negotiated solo win, the best kind.  Thanks
to Jim for running this game for about a thousand years.

Hey guys - thanks for allowing me to pull off this unique victory...this
was quite satisfying, and I appreciate being able to go out of the postal
Diplomacy hobby in style.  I also liked being able to do it while keeping all
my promises (survival for France and Germany; second place for Russia).
I really enjoyed working with all of you, and Jim-Bob, thanks for running
it.  I'll try to get an endgame statement to you soon.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.

2) I think it remains WAY cool that Death and Yorick are paired at the back of 
the pack.  Ah, we knew them well.
The finish is approaching, can Death and Yorick get over the second sprint line
before the race is over?  
I think the answer is no... it appears that the last three scoring riders can score 
next time.  Feel free to send in endgame statements or press if you want to make 
any.
Also signal to me if you'd like to play again, I'd like to keep running 
Breaking Away if there is interest.
Tom Howell easily wins the replenishment battle, but looks like he will finish
third in points, so Rick and Alex were more efficient.

Well, so much for that political statement, now it seems like Newt vs. Mitt
is going to go on for a very long time.
Each day it does go on increases the two key factors promoting Obama's 
re-election... fewer chances and time for a number of serious third party
candidates to emerge (they all have to wait until the Republicans decide
who they nominate) and less time for the Republican to try to redefine 
himself more moderately for the general election (though perhaps only 
Mitt really has his plan to do that - can anyone see another "flip flop"
on health care?).
