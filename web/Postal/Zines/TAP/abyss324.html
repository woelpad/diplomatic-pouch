<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website incorporating all subszines.

<br /><br />I'm still delaying one of the games for Medical reasons, but the others are going.  I can get this out before Doug, so this issue actually will NOT have an Eternal Sunshine (two issues before he can get another one out!!!).  Doug still makes legitimate comments about who should be subszine to whom.  He is my subszine toady though.... back, back, stay in line.  Write me a letter.... and voila, we have a letter from Doug below too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! 
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We will have four subszines going forward, from Dave Partridge, Doug Kent, Andy York, and 
Peter Sullivan.  Dave Partridge still is trying to finish <i>Tinamou</i>, Andy York is working on 
By the WAY, and Peter is getting Railway Rivals started!  
Doug of course puts us all to shame otherwise.
This issue only has an <i>Octopus' Garden</i> from Peter with a game start.
Dave and Andy are working on getting back in the swing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire szine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

Hi, Jim.  I grinned at reading your remarks about the string music festival in Maine, 
because I recently heard Crooked Still at the Grey Fox festival, and they were my 
favorite new-to-me band there.  Grey Fox also had a lot of events for teaching kids 
to pick bluegrass, so it makes me more optimistic for the future of the genre.  
I might try to make it to your Maine event next year.  
Can you point me to information about next year's dates and details yet?

I can't comment on most of the musical acts you fellas discussed this issue 
(or this year... same difference).  But as long as we're discussing music, 
I'll throw out my favorite newish CD's I bought in the past year.  
Some are not recent releases; they may be a year or two old...
and these are off the top of my head, so I may forget some.  
Haven’t seen a live show all year though.  In no particular order: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bird Song by Heather Masse –- As soon as I heard the opening track -– I Don’t 
Wanna Wake Up Today –- I knew I’d love this CD.  
I may actually prefer this solo release to her other work. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Get Wasted by Palmdale -– Kay Hanley rarely disappoints me, so this little 
collection of her typical style of pop is as pleasing as Babydoll or 
Weaponize or anything else she’s done recently. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Golden Apples of the Sun by Caroline Herring -– She has such a great voice, 
and the arrangements are so simple.  Wonderful music. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Near Demise of the High Wire Dancer by Antje Duvekot –- Without question, 
the best CD I have bought all year.  After listening to this about 100 times, 
I had to get a few more of her CD’s.  They’re all good, but this one is 
hands down the best.  Not a miss anywhere. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One Cell in the Sea by A Fine Frenzy –- I was a bit late to the party on this one, 
and to be honest the bits I’ve heard of her more recent releases do nothing for me.  
But the near-perfect blend of her voice, the songs, and the arrangements make 
this another home run. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Honorable Mention: Come Up Full by Meg Hutchinson; Laws of Illusion by Sarah McLachlin; 
See You on the Moon by Tift Merrit; Songs for a Hurricane by Kris Delmhorst; 
Too Much Living by Danny Balis; Who Do You Think You Are by Dala.

List the first fifteen you can recall in no more than fifteen minutes. 
Tag fifteen friends, including me, because I'm interested in seeing what

in a new note, list your fifteen picks below, and tag people in the note - 
upper right hand side.) Name the 15 albums that have had the biggest effect 
on you in no particular order...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fear and Whiskey by the Mekons (the best rock album in history);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Les Bains Douches, live album from Paris 1979, by Joy Division (the live
version and intensity of Ian Curtis while he was still alive);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Shoot Out the Lights by Richard and Linda Thompson (all great but this is the gem);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street by Stephen Sondheim, 
the original highlights recording with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury
(the intricate harmonies and everything, stupendous);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On Christmas Night by the King's College Cambridge with Simon Preston and Sir David 
Willcocks (these are the versions that are all in my head every Christmas);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, both recorded versions by Glenn 
Gould (I still love studying every one of these, both versions);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Messiah by Georg Friedrich Handel, the John Eliot Gardiner version (just the 
best choral music ever from that period);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mars Audiac Quintet by Stereolab (the sound, the sound, "Transona Five", RIP Mary Hanson);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who's Landing in My Hangar by Human Switchboard (you've never heard of this, but it
is stuck in my head);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sing Ye Heavens: Hymns for All Time by The Cambridge Singers led by John Rutter
(tender versions of some of the best hymns ever);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gloria: The Sacred Music of John Rutter (the best of the best of Rutter);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Boy by U2 (U2's first tour, first album, one of their first US shows, it all 
is as vivid as yesterday);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thru the Ears by Nektar (Doug asked memorable, this was one of my very first 
"adult rock" purchases);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When I Was Born for the 7th Time by Cornershop (have to have Indian influence);

<div class="p"><!----></div>
and

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Remember by the Schemers (and that's just the most memorable 80's music).))</i>

1) Mike Barno of course built two units, I identified his centers correctly but not 
his options in the Supply Center Chart.
Also, Dave had sent me an order change for A Venice that I had missed.
I have corrected that which results in a flip flop of VEN/ROM ownership, 
so Italy has Venice and Austria has Rome.
I am reprinting the SC chart as a result.

2) Hi all, as most of you know, Buddy's been having a tough time medically, but
he really wants to stay in the game, so I'd like to try to help him.
If you need to call Buddy about the game, mid-afternoon seems to be the best time.  
Buddy and I talked and we decided to delay this game one issue again and see
if he can continue.
I've printed the press since it seems sort of Pre-Fall relevant.
I hope no one will be upset about that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Quite a pack has reformed, and three riders have been permanently dropped
from the pack.  
Following szine patterns, we will keep all the riders on the board, even those
with hands of all threes who can't catch up.
And Dave (our only player with no points) had the largest replenishments this
time around, but Andy was only one point behind and Rick wasn't too far behind that.
Alex leads the point parade with three more scoring riders set to cross next turn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CREDO): Pack reforms.  Leave tired old dogmas at home.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(REPLY TO MATHEMATICIAN (1)): Seen on a tee-shirt about town:  "5 out of 4 people
hate fractions."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(REPLY TO MATHEMATICIAN (2)): I think the replenishment accumulation for each
rider should stop once the particular rider crosses the finish line OR eighth
place is scored for the finish line non-scorers.  At that point the race is
over.  An "efficient" rider, whatever that is, will most likely have a minimal
hand remaining after he/she/it finishes: 12 for most "A" riders, 9 for "B", "C",
and "D" riders.  The earlier a rider finishes, the more likely this will be
true.  Behind the leaders, in actual practice, there is often some bunching just
before the finish, and one cannot assume that every rider's last three
replacements are 3s and unused.  Nevertheless, an &#235;fficiency" score should
somehow account for the cards remaining in hand after the race is over.  If a
rider has "excess" movement in his hand when the race ends (for him), is he
more, or less, efficient?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I find it useful to keep track of each rider's "value" (sum of value of cards in
hand) each turn during the game.  That tells me how I'm situated relative to
the other riders/teams.  During the game, I want to build that up, towards the
end, I want to run it down as low as possible.  At the end, it means nothing, as
what counts are the points scored at the sprint and finish lines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(REPLY TO MATHEMATICIAN (3)):  The tee-shirt is an under-estimate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b> We've had a gorgeous summer up here in the Northeast, 
except for the last three days of driving rain.
As I write it is getting ready to clear up and then we're back into gorgeous
weather looking all the way into Labor Day weekend.  
I know some of you have really been into an amazingly hot and humid summer,
I hope you're all surviving wherever you are.
Start planning to come to chilly Providence in February the first weekend in
February for TempleCon!!!
