<br /><br />This was an extra bit late because of some unexpected events..... sorry!
For next issue, I'm keeping the deadline the same, but will delay games if
necessary.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
We have another exciting issue of <i>By the Way</i> in this issue if everything
is going as planned.
We're making progress on starting new games, help fill things up, see below for more.
The new regular Diplomacy game starts in THIS issue!!!
Here's an announcement from subszine editor, Dave Partridge....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Dave Partridge (Mon, 14 Aug 2006 10:37:27 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hello All,
Tinamou 62 is available on the web at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now's the time to sign up for Tinamou's annual Fantasy Football challenges
as well.  I run two very simple fantasy games, no need for complicated
drafting or lots of head scratching.  Just pick your favorite teams
or pick a weekly winner.  Rules are available at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/NFL.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Join either Simple Fantasy Footbal or Weekly Winner or both.  Come have
some fun.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal port/DipPouch/Postal

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now clearly back and appears in most issues!
Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack,
but Rip also has been missing in action lately, I don't have an update but he
and Dave Partridge communicate. 
Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games.
And Andy York has been my most frequent subszine guest lately!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JEFF KEY</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been planning to put Jeff Key up here many times in the past, but
someone else always made it to the list.
Since we have the aborted John Beshara search, this is the time to find Jeff.
I met Jeff that I remember just once, I think it was at Paul Gardner's house
and one of those wild spread out cons that he used to have at his house in
Vermont.  But I've not heard from Jeff now in many, many years.
So let's go find him!
As always it is worth fifty bucks if you locate him and get him to write to me.
Jeff, of course, is most famous for devising and naming the Key Lepanto 
game opening alliance between Austria and Italy against Turkey.
For some reason, I've been seeing LOTS of Key Lepantos or aborted 
Key Lepantos lately.  It's about time that we find Jeff and see what he's
been up to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.

We have closed the European continental branch, as I think most
of you had figured out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And the ISE in Australia hadn't had much real action in recent
years, and Brendan Whyte has moved on to Jerusalem!!!
Brendan still produces what I find to be the most readable
small szine in the worldwide hobby.
Did you all realize that?
Write to Brendan at his new Jerusalem address and ask him
about subscribing, I'm not sure what the new deal will be.
Department of Geography, Faculty of Social Sciences,
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem
91905, ISRAEL.
His travelogues are wonderful, I particularly enjoyed the
recent one describing his trip to Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius
and the areas around and in-between.  
You all know what countries those are right?
He also had a wonderful experience in a few hours on 
Belarussian soil stuck in a border crossing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
But most of the talk that there has been has about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson
and Tony Dickinson, among others!).  
This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really
is quite comprehensive.

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby

the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Stephen Agar has matched the Hasbro rule lists 
and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.
Check these out if you like:

Hi Jim,
The Deadwood Con Tom Howell referred to was on June 23-25th at the 
Ozogs. We did play Carcassone (which I haven't won yet) - I think Eric 
won if my alztimers memory serves me correctly. And Tom is being too 
modest re: the Lord of the Rings Risk game. He was the `individual 
winner'. For those readers of TAP unfamiliar with this commercial 
version of Risk - the Lord of the Rings Risk game is actually a good 
design although it has only four players. However, JB's Variant 
(me/mine) to the rescue! As the one 3M commercial says, "We don't make 
it, we make it better" my game brain put together my variant version of 
LoTR Risk which is what we played. My variant basically combines the 
several ways in the rules to win with play of up to 8 players (double 
the fun) who have to divide equally between good &amp; evil. For our game we 
had Cathy, Eric, Tom, myself and three teens, Shannon &amp; her two friends 
Sidney &amp; Daphne (they probably played 'cause of the movie). We did have 
some dropouts (the teens) as the game can be long (when Ring goes to Mt 
Doom - 24+ turns, we had something like 34). Tom was the top individual 
player with 24 pts (on the Evil side), Eric second at 22pts, John (me) 
at 20 then a tie for fourth at 12pts &amp; two lower scores (points being 
scored for territories, card play &amp; Strongholds - think Isengard, Minas 
Tirith, etc). As noted Good won although, if Evil wins, the game can end 
very quickly [one 8 player playtest game ended at 13 turns] with the 
right game play &amp; dice roll. If there is one design flaw in the 
commercial LoTR Risk game it is having only four players (instead of six 
or eight) plus the rules for winning are somewhat confusing given there 
are three different options. The game concept and design, in my opinion 
(being an old Risk hound), rate an 8 out of 10. I should post my LoTR 
variant rules to Grognard.com (where you will already find my 
house/variant rules for original Risk). [Sigh - for the old days of beer, 
puff &amp; pretzel - "aha, beat double sixes - damn, you lucky bastard, 
how'd you fluke that out!"]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Greetings Dippers,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is looking forward quite a bit, but I wanted to get it out there in
case plans needed to be put together in order to make it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll be hosting a game (or more?) of Diplomacy at U*Con, the gaming
convention held at the University of Michigan (in Ann Arbor, Michigan) each
November. U*Con (http://ucon-gaming.org/) runs from November 17-19th, and
the Dip game(s) will probably be held on Saturday the 18th around 10am or
noon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This will be my third year hosting a game, and hopefully we can keep the
trend of more players each year moving. Prizes are awarded to the winner
(gaming stuff). A day pass to the convention costs about $5-10 (I forget,
and it's not posted on their site yet), plus signing up for the game is $4
(or, it was last year), so you'll pay $9-14 bucks to play a real live face
to face game of Dip.

If you would like to come, please let me know. If there are enough people,
I'll make sure we have multiple games set up. If you need information about
places to stay, eat, or whatever, just send me an email.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U*Con is fun, even if Dip isn't there, so if you have the time, plan to
spend the night and attend more than just the Dip games.

Hi Boob, Thanks for the copies.  I send you e-mails, but until I read the

<i>((I respond to pretty much anything, if you don't get through or don't

Anyway, thanks for the issues.  I certainly don't mind if you send
them but please don't make undue expense for yourself.   Consider sending them
to me as an expedient sidebar, at best.   

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've semi-resurrected myself in a
few PBEM venues (DipBounced is the main one) and am a SB in a game with
the Duck, but I think my "Dip fire" has been suppressed into the
occasional hot ember.   Many reasons for it, but mostly a new phase of life - at
least until the kids grow a little more and school teaching quiets down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((That's just why I want to stay in touch!!!))</i>

We'll see.  For now I'm teaching a few novices from a Civ IV website who are
learning the game, as well as playing Gunboats.  Little to no pressure, and
great anonymity, except for the AHIKS Dip tourney I'm in, where these
old coots remember my, ahem, stabs from 4 years ago; funny, that.
Anyway, not much new with me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Did you like the April Fool's Boardman fake?  Poor John; reduced to venting
about mentally-ill losers faking his 'zine.  Whoever faked it should be
commended for style and for a forlorn attempt to resurrect the old habit of
fakes.

even gets Graustark any more, Williams won't admit it though.))</i>

<i>((Good to hear from you, especially after spending last weekend with Don
Williams (he is in the area for his sister's wedding).  Yes, I will
keep dropping you the occasional issue, completely on my dime, I understand.
I loved the Boardman fake and I'm still not sure if it was you, or
Don, or the two of you in cahoots who produced it, but it did annoy
the estimable Mr. Boardman.  Don and I are playing in his new game
there and enjoying it.  My feelings on war and such lie between yours
and his and as I grow older I grow to believe that these feelings are
much more about each of us as individuals and our genes and history
than about anything that is real.  Don is talking about becoming an
expatriate and "running away to Italy".  He's kind of upset at me
since I won't argue with him about it.  I don't like a lot of things
happening here in this country (on all sides), but I'm not a "running
away" person.  But if Don is, that could be right for him.
I am pleased that you're finding teaching to work for you and that you
and your family are happy there in Kentucky!!))</i>

<i>((ADDED: The re-estimable Mr. Williams would be upset if I didn't
expand further on that comment.... yes, Don has come to my Maine summer
lake house, and he has pronounced it good.
And the evening and the morning were the seventh day.....
I really enjoyed hosting Don, and he got to meet my grandchild Emily,
and I got to show Don how to canoe without tipping over.
We had a grand old time, and hope we can do it again sometime.
Any of you that wander this way in the Winter can visit me in 
Providence, but in the Summer you want to visit me in Maine.
I will let Don add something else for me to react to.... back

Hi J-B
Well, I'm flattered that you'd consider this little banter worthy of <i>TAP</i>
inclusion.  Usually I consider this type of stuff just vacuous noise.  But
if you think it'll generate interest / chatter and make the 'zine a little
bit more interesting than it already is, by all means put it in.  I don't
even mind including some of my more, shall we say, bellicose statements
concerning JB, but that's an editor's discretion that I'll leave up to you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I toned you down just a bit.... anyway, the fake was postmarked in 
Pensacola.
Pensacola is a military region, you must know people there..... and
Don seems to know people there too.  Don seemed to want to leave it
unclear as to whether it was you or him, which is why I thought it
might be a joint effort.  As always, I got to the third page before I
figured out it was a fake.  I'm the most gullible guy on the planet on
these things!!!  I had some other good suspects (including fake
meister Gary Coughlan), but in the end I was sure it was you or Don
from hints in the document.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for the fake, would that it have been Gary C!  I miss that lad.  As for
mailing location:  I know many people in many places, my friend, although it
IS a Navy base, and I've never been there.  Brother Don is a faithful
follower of omerta (the Mafia code of "honorable" silence), so we'll have to
leave its authorship as a Great Unknown for now.  There are several
DaVinci-like codes throughout the fake (so I've been told) that might be
construed as inside jokes, or references that only the "insiders"
know…again, as I've been told.   I myself find the photo names on pg 2
hilarious (Baldur von Schirach was the Hitler Youth Leader), as well as the
pg 3 "Arrow Shaft Native Indian Foundation" reference with Isaac Hayes and
Richard Roundtree (the composer and star of the black detective flick
"Shaft" in the 70s).  Upon closer study, many of the e-mails also have
hidden/associated meanings as well.  Anyway, as the Hall and Oates song
says, "Some things are better left unsaid."  I'm sure Don was prescient
enough to point out a few clues as well –- there are tons on each page.   If
you have questions on any, I might be able to help.   &lt; g &gt;   Poor John:
hoisted on his own petard.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While we're on that (and some of your reply thread to me):  don't
misunderstand my views, either-Boardman is famous for hearing but not
listening.  I think this President is one of the worst we've ever had,
and I'm not sure what, if anything, we're gaining right now in Iraq.
Having said that, I'm not sure that cutting and running, a la, 12 years
of Vietnam, will do for the place.  Racist as it sounds, I've yet to see
a legitimate Arab government that practices "our" style of
representational democracy, and I think the Arab world will forever be
"developing," but never developed.  Don wants to "cut and run" out of
frustration, I'm sure, because he's more of the liberal Democrat than I
am...yet his views and mine sometimes coincide, to both our amusement.
My only pique with Boardman is that he lays a blanket, a total
whitewash. On everything he disagrees with.  Fake his 'zine?  Sorry,
'not good enough because he hates fakes and affronts to his dignity.
Six soldiers torture prisoners?  The whole Army is therefore
rotten....that type of illogic.  I've even told John in the past that I
agree on points with him, but it gets lost in the rhetoric.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Heheheh, interesting, I think I agree with you more.  I am definitely
NOT a liberal Democrat, much more of a frustrated liberal Republican.
You and I agree on a lot, I suspect.  I definitely think we have to
live with the bed we're making in the Middle East.  Just 'cause it's
hard doesn't excuse running away.  But I do think it is funny that you
get "uncomplementary copies" of Graustark.  I am not so far from your
views that I shouldn't be just as uncomplementary to John.  Still, he
did start the Diplomacy hobby and he has been doing this SOOO long
that only people like me can imagine what that's like, and even I am
stunned.  So I forgive him a lot.  And he does make me laugh,
especially the tone and content of some of his wilder statements.
Yes, yes, I know they're dangerous, they still make me laugh.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
** I share the frustrated Republican thing.  My family were blue-collar
straight-ticket Democrats for decades, as Dad was a coal miner and a union
man.  Back then the dems were actually decent fellow:  Humphrey, Johnson,
etc.  The older you get, the more conservative you tend to become, but for
me, when the Dems began pandering to every rainbow-coalition,
union-fruitcake organization as the basis of their support, that's when I
got disenchanted with them.  If you count every 20th-century war before
1980, Dems were in office when they started (Wilson, FDR, Truman, JFK/LBJ,
Carter in Iran).  Of course, you can't BLAME these guys for bad timing, and
ever SINCE Ronnie Reagan, the GOP can't show much military success (Gulf I
was a "triumph without victory" and Gulf II is Quicksand, Inc).  I wish
there was a viable Third Party ticket, and that Teddy Roosevelt were alive
to lead us, by jingo!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
** The MidEast will get worse before it gets better.  Imagine if the
Mexicans were shooting Katyushas into Texas and Arizona every week…how long
would we tolerate it before we drove on Guadalupe and Mexico City?   Yet the
peaceniks here decry the Israelis, who've given up land and tried a few
peace offerings, and for what?  I am NOT a big "pro-Israeli" kind of guy -–
they're a trouble magnet, pure and simple, and I wish their nation was some
island in the middle of the Pacific.  Damn Brits and French created all this
mess when they artificially partitioned the Ottoman Empire after WW1 and
gave us this fiasco.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Sure and shootin', and way too much shootin' about it!!!  The French should
do more to help clean it up.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Having said that, Israel is fully justified in
crushing whatever gets in their way if it'll mean peace in the region.
Trouble is, I don't think there will ever be "peace" there.  If the Israelis
ever went away, then the Wahhabi Islamic sect would fight the Sunnis, who'd
fight the Shiites, who'd fight the -. and on and on.  Right now the world is
an EXACT replay of the Temptations' 1967(?) song, "Ball of Confusion".  If you
haven't listened to it, play it again and see if ANYTHING's changed since
then (short answer:  it hasn't).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I haven't listened to it in forever, but the words still echo in my head....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
** As for the "uncomplimentary copy" thing:  I used to laugh it off, because
Mr Doesn't Listen ignores my "cogent" comments and only keys on what he
perceives as my bellicosity and "war-mongering."  I'd send you the recent
clips of his, but you'd blanch and line your hamster cage with them.  That's
why the fake was so good, IMO:  the person took Boardmanisms from issues
past, turned them on their head, and made him look foolish.  As for the
duration of his pubbing, Jim:  yes, yes, longevity is a good thing.  But I
have other gamers in my Dip tourney who knew him as a young NYC gamer way
back then, and found him pompous and arrogant even then.  Hell, Hitler
produced the VW Beetle in the 30s.  Do we compliment that nutcase just
because he left us a nice automotive legacy?  (Ok, an extreme comparison to
be sure, but I for one don't tolerate increased senility going hand-in-hand
with increased pubbing longevity.  Call me TomFoolish if you must, or call
me petty –- just don't call me Tom Petty.  I think JB has a mean streak to
him at times, and he's intolerant, which, of course, makes ME seem the same
for counter-ranting against him.  Sigh.  Better left unsaid; must keep
repeating that…..

was chock full o'both, logically, given the World Cup).  But I'm glad my
paisani won the Cup, and there's only a few more weeks until Pittsburgh
tries for Super Bowl #6.   Now THAT'S worth waiting for!

be.  But one of my brothers is about as huge a Steelers fan as there
can be, as is my Associate Dean at Boston U., so I can't avoid
Steelers mania....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
** There is a beautiful piece about the Steelers and their fans, written
last year during the title run.  I'm going to enclose it, below.  It
actually brought a knowing tear to my eye, for the fans who cheer for the
black-and-gold are probably the most loyal of any diaspora who move from
their original homes.  I firmly believe this.   My Steelers shrine at home
now has a special candle lit for your brother and the Assoc Dean; stout
fellows, both!  You may tell them that for me.

time in Maine.
Effusive I generally am not, but I must share how much I care for you both and
waht tremendous friends you've been to me over these many years.
I won't soon forget the Lair, Bear's Way, Emily, the Boathouse, the vicious

Minnie, the wienie roasts, Charlotte's peach pie, Charlotte's apple pie,
the waffles n' blueberries, the ham and uber-cheesy sandwiches (on oat bran

constellations, and the Milky Way.
Wow....
and thanks again.
Please plan to come out to my home some time soon... I'd like to "try" to return
the favor.

I posted this guessing game to the PTKS list already, so if you've
seen it before, no guessing, please.
I had a game at Manorcon last week where my Italy
finished with 8 SCs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The question is: which eight were they?
I'll give you two hints:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Brian Shelden guessed 3/8

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Forza Italia!

<i>((I've got some answers and my guess below, so make your guess now before
reading on.
Thanks..... Boston Celtics news..... Celtics were closest to getting
Iverson, but
Philly has decided to keep him (the Celtics really didn't have the horse that
Philly wanted with enough certainty - only young guys with upside potential)
and the Celtics have won the Kevin Pittsnogle "lottery" with a two year deal.
While I think Pittsnogle is a project, it may allow them to trade someone else
in the front line.
Paul Pierce has had some minor surgery, but he should be ready for the start
of the season.
I'm continuing to be more and more of a Celtics fan again each season.
I think the "point guards" offense will be interesting.  Watch one of those
lineups where they have two points, Paul Pierce at small forward, Ryan Gomes
at power forward, and Al Jefferson at center.
I like it....))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((OK, 8 centers, eh, I guess Spa, Por, Par, Bre, Mar, Mun, Tun, Ven))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PS: Well you're doing better than most.  6/8.
(Problem is not that you omitted Rom and Nap, FWIW).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Well, I had typed in Bel and Hol instead of Tun and Ven and then
erased them thinking..... nah, he must have had SOME way to get the

<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (7/25/06)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That would have gotten you 5/8 instead.  I did manage to hold onto Tunis.
Basically on the move I thought Turkey might stab me for
Trieste, I blundered.  I had two armies that could have defended Venice
and I moved them both away, one to Vienna and the other to Munich.
After that the kid playing Turkey rolled through the boot.  After a
year or so of trying to hold on I realized I was investing five
armies to defend two SCs, and I'd have more success working with Yann
(England) to take out Germany.  Yann had given me Brest to keep me
alive and at the end of the game he was in a bitter struggle with Richard
Williams (Germany) so it was relatively easy for me to snag the German
centers with English support.  So the final SCs were Tun, Mar, Spa,
Por, Bre, Kie, Ber, and Munich.
Just like the Italian soccer team I defeated France and
triumphed in Germany, but all of my people are deserting the boot!  Forza
Italia!

<i>((Ah, well, I did see that you were working with Yann (David sent the
results
around, I'm going to print them in TAP, so if you want to write a
bit longer
commentary on the Con and this game that would be fun.....).
Then who sneaked in there to keep Paris??  Was that one of
Richard Williams' last centers??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PS: No, Yann had traded it with Richard before Richard eventually stabbed
him.  Pretty much everybody in the room kept telling Richard for
years that Yann was eventually going to stab him, so he got
twitchy.
Yann could not defend Paris at the end of the game, so he cut my
Kiel support for Munich.  Basically if I wanted to keep Munich, I
couldn't take Paris.  And I preferred Yann keeping Paris over Tom (the
young Turk) taking Munich.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((You didn't quite wipe him out even though you did take
all of his home centers.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PPS: I forget how many SCs Richard had at the end, but two of them
were Warsaw and Moscow.  Tom was too nice to Richard, and left him
alive for too long.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Dan Lester is playing in this new demo game that Adam Silverman
is running and he is bitchin' 'cause Gihan beat him for the
championship, but you and
Yann (and probably Richard early) cleaned Dan Lester's clock,
didn't you??
That cost him the ManorCon championship, how COULD you be so
inconsiderate????))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PPPS: It wasn't that close.  Gihan pretty much lapped the field.
Dan thinks I attacked him in R2 because he stabbed me in R1.  I
don't think it was so simple as that.  Part of it was because Yann was
England, and I preferred working with Yann than with the people
in the East.  Part of it was that I tend to favor an early growth
strategy for Italy in cons, and part of it was that I felt that
going West would work better than going East.  And sure, part of it was
the feeling that no way was I going to let Dan get the better of me
two games in a row.   But another part of it was the feeling that I'd
made a mistake in R1 letting Dan off the hook when I was A, Dan
was R, and Dave Wreathall was I.  We would have broken R down
eventually but I ran out of patience, and Dave spooked me with an
unannounced move into Tyrolia.
About the con in general, it seems that the British hobby is
hitting a down point.  As always over here, the play level is excellent,
but a lot of people are not playing any more.  And it's much harder
to recruit new players than it was, say, fifteen years ago because
there are so many other gaming options these days.
On Thursday I'm off for Vienna.  Is there much more to say about
Manorcon?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What are all of these emails trying to cast doubt on my photo of Eric 
Ozog?  Obviously that is Eric.  The fact that people don't recognize him 
only shows that the real Eric Ozog has been replaced by a duplicate, and 
not a very good one at that.  These emails from people like Mark Berch 
(if it really is Mark Berch) only serves to demonstrate the length that 
these people will go to hide the truth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Ah, of course, and I have only met the DUPLICATE ERIC!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the record, I met Eric and Cathy before they were married and have 
played Diplomacy at their Forest Service residence in Verlot.  It has 
been years since I have seen Eric so it doesn't surprise me that a 
duplicate has taken over Eric's identity.  It probably explains why I 
was never invited back as I would have immediately recognized the 
imposter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Wait, but I also met Eric before he was married to Cathy, and he
DIDN'T look like that, you're trying to fool us!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is my theory that the real Eric Ozog was abducted by the U.S. Forest 
Service as part of their program to replace pro-environment employees 
with clear cut clones.  CCCs have been instrumental in destroying the 
forests east of Granite Falls.   Fortunately the CCCs are not of the 
highest quality and some forest still remains.  But until the real Eric 
Ozog returns to stop the massive waste and destruction by the USFS we 
are all at risk.  Therefore, I hope that you will join me in the search 
for the real Eric Ozog.  Go to FindtheRealEricOzog.org for more details.

But I think we should be able to get at least ten people playing.
I have an advance commitment from Brad Wilson to be in, so this should be FUN.
When we're done, whoever wins I'll try to figure out how to make a CD of tunes from
the list for them.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
I'll start things up in a couple of issues once I have enough entrants.

The Rangers suck, doing their August fade as always. 
I can't really complain about the moves they made
before the deadline, whether or not they get Carlos
Lee to resign.  Coco Cordero was not going to be
picked up for next year at the cost of his contract,
Nix is done, and Mench was an average player who
hasn't done anything offensively except for that 7-day
span where he hit 7 home runs.  I just wish we had
tried to shift into SELL mode to unload somebody like
Padilla who leaves at the end of the year...the more
prospects we could pick up the better.

Jim,
My parting opinions on the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Although there was 
exciting `football' played, this World Cup got close to having the 
fewest goals scored (the perennial knock on the game-not enough goals). 
Football purists would, of course, retort this is the way it's supposed 
to be. So no surprise then that the eventual winner, Italy, had the #1 
ranked goalie and probably the #1 defence, as well. They did get the 
breaks and played well as a team. My main complaint on the Italian win 
is now the rest of the world has to listen to Italian bragging for the 
next four years. I agree with those <i>TAP</i> readers who say yellow cards 
should be handed out more readily on dives. Also, FIFA must do away with 
the shoot out for determining wins. What a crock! I say `play on' till a 
real goal is scored because one eventually will be. The argument that 
the players will tire is nonsense - this affects each team equally. 
Perhaps additional substitutions into extra time could be considered. In 
conclusion, I found there were four controversial games that affected 
this World Cup. Three of them were shoot outs and the other was decided 
on a penalty kick. The penalty kick game was the Italian win over 
Australia (a blatantly bad call by the referee - the Aussies got jobbed 
on that one and wouldn't it have been interesting if the Aussies had 
won, eh?). That call (other than the idiot Referee in the Eng/Por game) 
was probably the worst of the tournament. The three games decided by the 
shoot out were all important games - they were two Quarterfinals,  Arg 
vs Ger, Eng vs Por and the Final itself, Fra vs Ita (I do not include 
the penalty kick win of Fra over Por since the call was legit - more 
legit anyway than the call on the Aussies). Looking at these shoot outs 
one sees six of the football powers matched up and pretty much even in 
talent, heart, etc. Personally, I was glad to see Brazil exit early (eat 
some humble pie Brazil - tho I do like their attacking style of play), 
as like Italy, those two groups of fans think they are better 
footballers than anyone else. If this was the case they'd win all the 
time, which (haha Italy &amp; Brazil) they don't.  So, in my opinion, this 
`artificial' way to end the game via a shoot out is a travesty to the 
way the game is actually played. Play on till the winner is scored! For 
this reason alone, the 2006 World Cup failed to deliver real football 
results.

So it appears that the Tour de France will be won by an American named 
"Floyd".  Does he have Goober, Barney and Howard Sprague for teammates?  And 
how much does this piss off the French?
<i>((Well, as we now know apparently it did piss off the French and this has been 
rescinded.  And since Floyd speaks no French, at least Lance could speak French.
The French are not pleased that they can't mount a French challenger.

I have determined that the Cubs need to replace their owner, general 
manager, manager (probably), groundskeeper and trainer, get 2 starters, 1 
middle reliever, 2 outfielders and 2 or 3 clutch hitters, and then I'll have 
a team to root for.  I'm thinking that this shouldn't take longer than 98 
years to accomplish.  Bring on football.  At least my NASCAR fantasy team is 
doing well (16th out of 516).

What be football and NASCAR???  ;-)
It does look like Baseball (sans Cubs) is scoping out some exciting
races (and will make for low trade deadline action).  The White Sox
are coming back to the pack and the Tigers continue to be for real.
So the two Sox teams, the Twins, the Yankees and the Blue Jays are
five teams fighting for two playoff spots.  I think that will 
continue for the rest of the season, with the two Sox teams the
favorites and the only potential to accelerate to safer climes.
Plus all four West teams are in the hunt.  The NL is similar, 
except the Mets are the team "for real".  Then you have a host
of East/Central teams fighting for two spots and the West is a
race.  My Giants are in first place.  And yes, the Shea Hey Kid
is a bit of a jerk, but at least he's now in Willie Mays' ballpark
with Barry Bonds.  Yes, Shea Hillenbrand will surely reclaim his
Shea Hey Kid nickname he had with the Red Sox now.))</i>

This totally snuck up on me.  I was at Manorcon this past weekend,
will be in Vienna next weekend for the Austrian con, and then to
Berlin for WDC.  
The Cubs had two very promising young starters, before Dusty drove them
into the ground.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob, Football is a game that people play over here with eleven players per
side, a "pitch" with a goal at each end, and an inflated sphere that
everybody kicks around trying to get it into the goal.  Everybody
runs around for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans win.  (Though
this year the Italians managed to break that rule.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NASCAR is one of these bizarre competitive automobile driving
organizations that never requires its drivers to turn their cars to
the right.  "Links fahren" is how the Germans describe it.  For me
it's F1 or nothing (but mostly it's nothing).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other teams need to hope that the Twins don't make the playoffs. 
Santana plus Liriano is pretty scary.  I'm not scared by the erratic
Blue Jays, who seem to need a lot more pitching.  The Yankees have
the same problem, but worse.  I'd lean to thinking it will be the two
Sox teams.
But none of the AL West teams is particularly good.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Mets are for real.  To tempt fate, I have officially announced
that the Braves cannot possibly make the playoffs.  (This is much
stronger than my feelings about the Yankees).  St. Louis is also for
real.  The rest of the NL is pathetic.  There are 10 NL teams below
.500.  The AL has been crushing them in Interleague competition.

Hey, winning the World Series every 98 years is an accomplishment
to be proud of.  We know!
I flipped through channels this weekend and there was the end of
some NASCAR race.  They had just set records for the most cautions
(19 I think) and the most laps under caution (over 100 in a 250
lap race).  Seems to me that they're trying to learn from futbol's
world wide popularity. Long periods of nothing happening interspersed
with short periods of action.  Of course NASCAR's action involves
car wrecks and futbol only has shots on goal.

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Tue, 25 Jul 2006 07:37:56 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To take these recent points as best as I can...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob raises a good point (boy, I've never typed THAT before!).  What do 
we want out of sports viewing?  Or maybe what do we want out of our sports? 
If we're looking for continuous excitement with no letup we'll look a long 
time, unless we're watching bullfighting or SportsCenter.  If we're looking 
for scoring chances at every turn, then there's more choices.  As Jim-Bob 
points out we have both hockey (the NEW NHL) and basketball on any level, 
plus a few others.  I would submit Arena Football for nomination into that 
club, as the game I saw several years ago was 66-63, a total of points not 
always matched in that arena by the NBA games played there, and they could 
and would score from everywhere on the field.  Hockey scores less, but there 
are a fair amount of chances, and a lot of action now that it no longer 
looks like...er...the NBA.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was going to submit for the masses an event that's hard to put into a 
sound bite, so let me just say that the longest I was ever on my feet 
continuously giong crazy at a sporting event was the first 3 minutes of a 
sprint car race held on a 3/8 mile dirt track (note:  make sure you're 
sitting upwind if you go) where the first 4 drivers swapped the lead every 
lap.  Unfortunately, at about lap 10 the leader caught the back of the pack 
and disappeared, so the last 30 laps was kinda dull.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But where do you sustain that emotion and sports viewing "high" for that 
long, or longer?  And is that really what you want?
Note that I have no answer for that last one.  Is there a sociologist in the 
house?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The NASCAR race that Dave alludes to was held this past Saturday at 
Martinsville, and was NASCAR's AAA (Busch series) league's weekly event 
(note:  what other sports get their top minor league televised live every 
week?), this week held at a track that's too small to hold all 43 cars on it 
(if you spaced them out evenly, there would only be 40 feet in between each 
car, so my old Driver's Ed instructor would say that they shouldn't go more 
than 20mph there).  In contrast, the main event for the weekend was held at 
a 2.5 mile track (Pocono), where there's plenty of room unless you're Tony 
Stewart (or getting passed by him).  Which one makes better viewing?  Again, 
I don't have an answer to that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for comparing NASCAR and F1, having worked with a chap who was born &amp; 
raised in England and a die-hard F1 fan, my determination is, in his words, 
"it's what you were brought up on".  I can see the positives for both, and I 
can see the attractions for both.  I would love a return to the glory days 
of F1 where you could actually overtake another driver if you had a better 
car, but that would require a lot of rule changes that would take the 
technology out of F1, which is it's whole reason for being.  NASCAR "dumbs 
down" the car so that you can have the picture that I showed my F1 friend 
once, where 2 cars were side-by-side for the win with a lap to go, and 
neither driver was in the top 20 in points.  "It's what you were brought up 
on".  Now that I think on it, we had the same discussions/conclusions on 
football/futbol.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I need to correct Jim-Bob on another point (ah, we're back to normal), in 
that the fun for a Cubs' fan is NOT "in the despair", but in the hope.  This 
differs from Red Sox Nation, who appear to believe either that they're 
entitled to win every year or believe that they HAVE won every year, final 
standings notwithstanding.  Cubs fans will sit in the bleachers in April 
with a sign saying "Wait 'Til Next Year" and mean it.  It doesn't mean 
they're despondent, it means that better times are just around the corner. 
(Again:  is there a sociologist in the house?)  Early this year (I think it 
was the second weekend) the Cubs went into St. Louis and took all 3 from the 
Cards.  I opined to a die-hard that that would, unfortunately, be in the top 
5 of highlights for the Cubs this year (and he agreed).  100 games in I'm 
starting to wonder if it won't be #1 (Barrett punching Pierzynski isn't 
close, despite what many think).  It doesn't mean I'm going to stop drinking 
the Kool-Aid, it just means I have a more realistic assessment of my team's 
chances this year than RSN usually has.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gotta go.  In case you hadn't heard I've been laid off, and so I'm chasing 
new employment (2 interviews coming up in the next week), which is taking 
WAY too much time away from my sports.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Zine arrived 3 days ago.
Re your comments on gerrymander.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's quite easy to eliminate. You simply have a rule that no 
electorate can have a perimeter:area ratio of more than X.
Then you argue over the value of X.
The main issue then becomes what to do about islands off the coast, 
and the simplest answer is to use standard baselines then.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another option is to use the boundaries of subdivisions that already 
exist: counties.
Just divide the state into X number of electorates by grouping the counties.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((You're presuming that someone actually sincerely wants to solve
the problem.
A major part of it is that no one really does.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This raises a problem of equal populations: do the electorates have 
to have equal populations?
Most countries allow a variation of maybe 5 or 10%.
In Queensland rural electorates are allowed significantly smaller 
populations than urban ones simply because the rural ones are so big, 
that it would otherwise no give them any true LOCAL representation. 
It also makes it easier for the member to get around his electorate 
if it isn't too massive. And so access to one's member is played off 
against a smaller electoral population. Compare an inner city 
electorate where all the population is within walking distance of 
their member's office, to a massive rural electorate where the office 
may be several hours away by plane, assuming you can fly direct! To 
claim that all electorate MUST have the same population to make 
voting fair, is to overlook significant differences in physical 
geography, infrastructure etc that limit access within electorates, 
and so act as a proxy discrimination.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course the best solution is to remove electorates entirely and 
have members at large. Australia does this for the Senate: each state 
supplies X number of senators as a whole. all senators represent the 
whole state. Easy, and fairer proportionally too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally one other option is to get rid of your upper house 
altogether. New Zealand did it. Queensland did it. Is a bicameral 
legislature actually necessary?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[But don't use the word bicameral too freely: I tried to use it in a 
game of hangman with an ex-girlfriend and she considered it cheating 
to use such weird words, and never played with me again! ]

<b>SPY DIPLOMACY (Variant, revised Dec. 1986)</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
by Jim Burgess

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rules:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Unless otherwise specified, the standard rules of Diplomacy apply.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Players receive adjudications for their own armies and fleets, but not
the armies and fleets of other powers.  Similarly, each player sees only
his or her own section of the supply center chart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) In addition to the standard units, an unit called a &#223;py" is added.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Each of the seven powers begins with a spy in each home supply center.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies are supplied only by home supply centers (i.e. Russia may have
as many as four spies at a time while other powers are limited to a maximum
of three).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies are "built" and "disbanded" in Winter seasons at the same time
as other units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) There is no limit to the number of spies that may be present in any
province and spies may be "stacked" with armies or fleets (exceptions are
listed in Rule 6).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Spy Reports

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spies report the location and nationality of armies and fleets in
the province they occupy and all adjacent provinces immediately following
the standard Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons (i.e. just prior to
the spy movement seasons).  Spies can differentiate between units in retreat
and successful attackers when two units &#246;ccupy" a province.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies also report the nationality of spies in the province they occupy
and the presence (but not nationality) of spies in adjacent provinces at the
same time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Movement of Spies

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spy movement follows the collection of spy reports, so orders to spies
may be made conditional on any information gathered by spies on opposing troop
movements or the adjudication of one's own units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies move after each of the following standard seasons: Winter,
Spring, Summer, and Fall (note that all spy movements PRECEDE Autumn
retreats), beginning with Winter 1900.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies move as armies do with the following exceptions:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Spy movements cannot be stood off by movements of any other unit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spies may be convoyed by fleets of any power during any of the
four movement seasons for spies.  The convoy orders for fleets in these
seasons must be ordered by their owner in the usual fashion or else the spy
convoy movement fails of execution.  Fleet convoy orders for spies may be made
in addition to regular Spring and Fall moves (note, however, that the fleets
themselves never move during spy movement seasons).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spies may also be "picked up" and carried by fleets of any
power. Embarkation and debarkation are moves that must be made during a
spy movement season and "permission to board" is not required.  Embarkation
consists of a movement from a land province to an adjacent sea province
containing a fleet.  Debarkation consists of a movement from a sea province
containing a fleet to an adjacent land province.  A spy may not &#223;witch
fleets in midstream".  Once boarded, a spy may only get off by debarking.
After boarding a fleet, the spy moves with the fleet during regular movement.
A spy may not debark from a fleet awaiting retreat (e.g. if a fleet carrying
a spy is dislodged in Spring, the spy may not debark until the spy movement
season following the standard Summer retreat season).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) Spy Mortality

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) This rule will outline the circumstances under which spies may be
captured or killed.  Spies may be disbanded in Winter seasons at the same
time as other units to meet the requirement that a power may not have more
spies than the number of currently held home supply centers and spies are
annihilated when they are on board a fleet that retreats off the board.
Otherwise, spies may only be removed from the board (there is no difference
in the game between capturing and killing a spy, but players should feel
free to delineate between the two states in writing press) immediately
following the four spy movement seasons.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies killed or captured in a given season do not submit written
spy reports for that season, though their final movement may have been
made conditional on that spy report.  Players may never know for sure how
a spy was lost, just as in real life.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies are "killed" by being assassinated by other spies.  When a
spy moves, he or she may attempt an assassination, specifying the nationality
of spies to be executed if discovered.  Each spy may hunt for only one
nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
will govern the adjudication of assassinations:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) A spy may attempt an assassination without moving (for instance
if the target is in the same province).  In this case, any spies of the target
nationality that end the spy movement phase in that province are assassinated
with one exception.  If the spy attempting the stationary assassination is
himself or herself assassinated by a moving assassin then that spy
assassinates no one in that season (not even a potential target other than the
one that assassinates that spy).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) A spy attempting a moving assassination (may include a move of
embarkation or debarkation from a fleet) is always successful in assassinating
spies of the target nationality that finish the spy movement phase in the
province that the spy moves to.  This makes "mutual assassinations" possible.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Example: French spy is on board a French fleet in the Channel.
An English spy is in London.  Both powers specify assassination attempts
against the spies of the other.  If the English spy embarks on the French
fleet in the channel (remember that embarkation does not require the
permission of the fleet being boarded) and the French spy doesn't move, the
French spy is killed, but the English spy isn't (he may be immediateIy
captured, however, see part D).  If a German spy is also on board and the
French spy tried to assassinate the German spy, that operation would fail
as well. If the French spy debarks to London at the same time, the two spies
"pass in the night" and neither is killed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) Spies are "captured" by opposing armies and fleets.  Players may
attempt to capture spies, specifying the nationality of spies to be captured
if discovered.  Each army and fleet on the board may search for spies of one
nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
will govern the adjudication of attempts to capture spies:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Players may specify a nationality to be hunted separately for
each unit or they may issue blanket searches to be applied to all units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) At the end of the spy movement phase, any spies of the
nationality specified in the same province are captured (for example, if
the French player specifies a hunt for English spies on their Channel fleet
in the above example, then the English spy is captured).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Players are informed when they successfully capture an opposing
spy.  Note that the &#246;wner" of the spy, however, is not informed of the
capture.  Communication just is cut.  This rule is the only exception to the
generaI rule that armies and fleets are blind.  It is possible to play the
game without allowing capture of spies by armies and fleets if one wishes
to allow freer movement of spies (i.e. RuIe D may be ignored).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7) It is suggested that the game be adjudicated in four separate seasons
in the following order:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spring: (for Spring 1901 this sequence is preceded by a spy movement
phase (no spy reports are necessary) followed by assassinations or captures)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've got lots of openings in the subszines, check them out!!!
Especially, contact Rip Gooch for Railway Rivals,
see Rip's subszine elsewhere in most issues of <i>TAP</i>.
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com and try to entice him to return.
Rip has been a bit missing in action lately, but I am assured that he
SHALL return.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm ready to start a new Breaking Away game, who's interested???
Challenge David Partridge again as he is in, so are 
Brendan Whyte and Alexander Woo.
I also am giving a free spot to Eric Martin.
Anyone else?
Rick Desper is in too.
That leaves us looking for ONE more spot, can I convince someone to take that now???
Please, please, I'd like to get toward starting that next issue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game of REGULAR Diplomacy if there is enough interest!!!
I have seven I'm putting in this game, and I think there was even more interest
for another game (starting with Sean O'Donnell - Sean and Jeff both wanted into
this game, but I decided to put Jeff in since Jeff gave me a preference list first.
We have Marc Ellinger (pd), Drew James (pd),Don Williams (pd), John Crow, 
Fred Wiedemeyer, David Burgess, and Jeff O'Donnell. For truth in advertising, David is my brother, but I will be scrupulously fair
in GMing things and if in doubt, will call on an ombudsman... or just rule 
against Dave.... that's fair, right???  ;-)
This game starts below in THIS issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.
We have Karl Schmit and Sean O'Donnell on the list, let's get seven!!
It's FREE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
The rules are published in THIS VERY ISSUE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough and Bruce Edwards are interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, Steve Koehler, Art Schleinkofer,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, and Dave Partridge are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, we only need TWO more!

Last chance is gone here, these games never really got going all that far in the
first place.
And I really couldn't get back more than one player in each game and it seemed 
silly to get that many standbys.
Any of you old <i>Ishkibibble</i>ites want to play in a new game start??
Or should I just drop the free subs I've been giving you all??
Your choice.
Anyone who was a subber to <i>Ishkibibble</i> may join any new
game for free, but this is a ONE TIME only offer, get your request in now.
Marc Ellinger and Fred Wiedemeyer already have taken us up on this request.
Come on, let me call by name who qualifies
for this deal..... Karl Schmit, John Power, Tim Snyder,
Dave Partridge, Graham Wilson, and Kevin Wilson.
I especially would like to fill the Modern Diplomacy game that Dave Partridge
already is in.

1) Welcome to our newest regular Dip game.
David is my brother, but I've decided to let him play here after debating it back 
and forth for awhile.
You can see how unbiased I can be to start as he ended up with Austria in the 
Random Draw, and there he stays.
John Crow and Drew James are returning after relatively long absences from the
Dip Scene, welcome back!!!
Jeff, Don, and Fred have been in lots of games here recently.
And Marc is a recipient of one of the Phil Reynolds memorial slots.
I thought it would be a good tribute to name this the Phil Reynolds Memorial.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Mr. Howell, may we please have a 2006 Boardman Number?
Thank you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) John Crow and Jeff O'Donnell are NOT on-line, I don't believe.  But both enjoy
getting cell phone calls about the game, I believe.
Otherwise, you'll have to work out your own ways of communicating.
Can I fill in missing contact information, please???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just received a message from the Klingons.
This is unusual because there are no Klingons in this universe.
The Nosican Commander sent Commander Worf a compic meant for me, except
that he sent it to the wrong universe.
(I wonder if I can blame "Q"???
Assuming he's not dead!....
<i>((I ain't dead yet....))</i>
Worf was nice enough to send the message back to me through one of my Borg
sensors.
I really appreciate Mr. Worf's effort, especially when you consider the Klingons
got wiped out in my last reality as a direct result of his alliance to the Federation.
Note to Nosican Commander: this is the Federation, not the Klingon Empire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P.S. Later that day.
I have received a direct communique from the Nosicans.
The problem is we have been unable to figure out how to communicate directly within
the Nosican communications net.
Lt. Uhura has not figured out how to get through.
I can only hope they contact us again.

1) Alex is moving to A Bur-Hol, or something like that, skipping over the Ruhr or Belgium.
His new postal address is noted above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS): Captain Kirk's Log; Mr. Spock has confirmed "Q" is re-forming our original 
universe.
We are going to use the same duplication protomatter device to attempt to enter
this universe.
The only question is, will we get through or will our duplicates?
<i>((Q Hint: This Universe will have something to do with Phil Reynolds.))</i>
We will never actually know for sure.....
(later that day) I just received a disturbing report from Mr. Spock.
He says he has analyzed the telemetry required to enter our old universe and
he has determined that there are no Klingons in that universe.
"Bummer!"
Spock says I should blame "Q".
<i>(("Q" never takes no blame for nuttin.
If Klingons are missing, then that's the way it "should be".))</i>
Oh well, Mr. Worf sucks anyway, so what's the difference?
Maybe if one of the alien groups falters, "Q" will allow the Klingons in.
Time will tell.
At least I'm in, and really that's all that matters.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PETTY DICTATOR to SEAN O'DONNELL): I'm just not feelin' the love!.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TREK PRESS II): A conversation between Kirk (K) and Spock (S).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Captain, I've discovered something troubling about the new universe that we
are attempting to enter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: What's the problem, other than no Klingons?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: This universe is actually not a duplicate of our original universe
like I first thought.
It is actually a duplicate of this universe with an alternate reality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: This universe!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: There's more.
Our scans have picked up a "Q" signature in the new universe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: What exactly are you saying?!?!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: One of the Alien groups in the new universe is being run by a member of the
"Q" continuum.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Q: Not true, not true. 
Any such assertion is patently false. 
Any such alleged individual has had ALL powers (and I mean ALL powers which
might be deemed to devolve on members of the "Q" Continuum) removed prior to
entering said universe.
There will be NO monkey business, maybe some finch business, but no monkey business
in this Continuum.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S CONTINUED: Apparently he is lowering himself to the level of our "insect-like
existence" to see if he can compete with us humanoid to humanoid.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Spock!
This makes no sense to me.
This is "Star Trek!"
The Original Series!
THere aren't supposed to BE any "Q's" until Next Generation!
It's not fair!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: You didn't complain when 7 of 9 was here.
She's supposed to be in Voyager.
Besides, this is "Star Trek: Alternate Reality".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Good point.
Do you think we can trust this "Q" not to use his "powers" to his advantage?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Q always uses our powers to OUR advantage, but there ain't no Q powers in the 
powers in this Continuum or any other in this szineness space.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: I think so, Captain.
"Q's" pattern so far has been that he is twisted, but not necessarily dishonest.
I think we can trust him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: So what do we call this "Q"?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: "Q".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: But that is what we call OUR "Q".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: They are all called "Q".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: We have to call him something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: How about "Q2"?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: No, that's too unimpressive.
I know!
We'll call him "QII"!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: You don't like "Q2", but you do like "QII"???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Yeah!
The Roman numeral adds a certain amount of class to the Super Bowl, and it kinda sings!....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: I will never understand humans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Do you think "QII" will be a Red Sox fan?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Unknown.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Not Red to be sure, perhaps he has been known to be something of an Orange fan....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S CONTINUED: Captain?
What if he turns out to be a Yankee fan?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Then we invade first chance we get!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: As you wish....
