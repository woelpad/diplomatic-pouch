<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>.

<br /><br />There is interest in a NEW regular Diplomacy game and a Breaking Away game.  Sign up, let's see if we can get seven for Dip!  The Breaking Away game is 
filled and we will get it started in the next issue, I've called for 
cards and rider names.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

<b>DIPLOMACY WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT IS ONGOING - YOU CAN STILL JOIN!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started in January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my next game.
Yes, in C-Diplo, you can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.
There is about to be a huge uptick in games starting as September approaches
in a few days.
My game is waiting for more players to start, won't you come join me???

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

stand by for regular Diplomacy.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) We seem to be back on track here now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(OLD FRANCE to NEW RUSSIA): I appreciate your willingness to 
vote for any draw, Tsar Gardner.  
Those draws including England and France, and only England and France, 
shall also meet with approval here in Paris.  
Prime Minister James is a poltroon and a scoundrel, 
but he is our poltroon and scoundrel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB COMMENTS ON POLTROONS): How dare we call anyone a coward in Diplomacy.
Where DOES our Frenchman get these words...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LE DUC to THE ARCHDUKE): I understand your frustration over 
my march into New Brest, er, Trieste, really.  
Would it help at all to remind you that the 
Italians felt the same way when you stole Trieste from them last war?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE LAST WAR): We always fight the last war, rather than this one!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS to LONDON): Well played, sir, well-played.  
May English wartime deeds and glorious endeavors be 
forever on the lips of heroes and school children everywhere.  
Insofar as they don’t include nefarious actions against her 
beloved French ally, of course.  
Then we’d have to declare you to really suck.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to JOHN): We definitely need to set aside some time to talk.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SWEET INNOCENCE to NAUGHTY NAUGHTY CHARLOTTE): The nuns are looking for you.
Something about a seriously overdue spanking.  
Contact me for details.  Or reservations... I'm easy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SWEETIE): You are ANYTHING but easy...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SOCRATES to JIM-BOB): Did it ever occur to her that she could bob for Jim?  
It's all in the naming of the thing...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SOCRATES): I'm sure many things have occurred to her.
Naming is everything, I agree.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RECYCLED RHYMER to GM):  
Play it, Jim.  
<i>((I sing, I sing, I sing for thee!))</i>
You played it for her, you can play it for me ... If she can stand to listen to it, I can. Play it.
<i>((I sing, I sing, I sing for thee!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <b>Eighteen Dots*</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some Dippers say a solo is hard to attain

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I say it's easy, in a zero-sum game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Grabbing each dot as if it was mine

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I make sure to cross ev'ry stalemate line.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 I'll grab eighteen dots - with no regret

<div class="p"><!----></div>
'Cause I’m attackin' Russia and I ain't done yet

<div class="p"><!----></div>
St. Petersburg is falling and I want more

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll gobble up MOS and finish with WAR.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 I just love to play England, Wicked Witch of the West!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sailing fleets over borders when I’m playin' my best

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And through the North Sea I can convoy the rest

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Taking BEL and HOL and-a DEN and Brest...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 It's just eighteen dots, an' I started with three,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ain't hard to manage - just another fifteen!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Saint Petersburg first then it's on to the Med

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Until that happens, though, I'll just play dead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Look, my lips are moving, yeah - I'm lyin' a ton

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Weasel-tongued words are just part of the fun.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was taught well by Burgess –- yeah, I learned at his knee,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"To solo" he said, "just-a listen to me."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "You snatch eighteen dots, more if you can,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A little insurance is a part of the plan.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Make sure you snatch Tunis –- without it you’re toast!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Move fast, my boy or they'll stalemate that coast."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 My blue blocks are sweepin', better move aside –-

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My fleets and armies are an Indigo Tide!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By land and sea England's power will surge

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I gotta try to solo - it's a powerful urge... 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 I'll grab eighteen dots with no regret.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Will I feel shameful?  Well it ain't happened yet!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No blame or hate or guilt, now I can't wait... 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll call my solo right here... in oh-eight...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Send in your riders and their starting cards NOW!!!
Your A rider can have three or four cards that need to add up to 30,
your B rider three cards adding up to 25, your C rider three cards
adding up to 20, and your D rider three cards adding up to 16.
You also need to name your team, and can have a team captain if you want.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Keep in mind in choosing your initial cards the initial rules for overcrowding.
First turn only - if at the end of the first turn (only), any square has 
5 or more cyclists on it then the square in front is treated as if were 
blank for card replacement purposes. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) The name of this new game is FOR THE MEKONS ET AL., actually a song by
Will Oldham.
