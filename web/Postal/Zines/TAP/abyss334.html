<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.  
Join the tidal wave of Dippers going to 
World DipCon in Chicago in August, we can overwhelm Shark Chum with 330 warm bodies!

<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug will keep us on schedule so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't usually look ahead in the MLB schedule, since my philosophy is that
teams (especially mine) can win only 1 game at a time, but I happened to 
see an ad on ESPN for next weekend's Sunday Night Baseball, and I find that 
the Red Sox are coming to Wrigley Friday through Sunday (Have the Red Sox 
been here since interleague started?  I don't recall it happening...).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Shall we place the same bet as last year when the Cubs were at Fenway?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Last year the bet was that the fan of whichever team lost the 3 game series at 
Fenway (Cubs/Red Sox) had to use for a week as their Facebook profile picture,
one of them wearing the other team's hat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ergo, for a week last Summer this was my profile picture: <i>((you're 
saved the blindness risk....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ok, it's not my best side.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Same again this year for the upcoming rematch at Wrigley?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And Rick, I finally found that the Red Sox had indeed been at Wrigley in 2005 
as well.  Don't know why I wouldn't have remembered that.  
I would have thought we'd have had some bet going on then too.

And on another note, something I saw last night:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MLB game.  Back and forth, home team takes 4-3 lead in bottom of the 8th.  
Top of the 9th, 2 out, no one on.  
The sellout crowd of 41,000 - none of whom has left - rises to its feet 
and starts yelling and screaming.  3rd batter of the inning
hits a weak ground ball to the 2nd baseman for the easy 3rd out 
and home team wins.  
Crowd goes nuts, holds up banners and sings the silly song that's sung 
when the home team wins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And with that the Cubs went to 21-40.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Could that possibly happen in Boston?

Sure.  Game 6 of the conference finals.  Celtics are getting hammered.  
Only a few minutes left. Crowd chants Go Celtics for 3 straight minutes, 
prompting Celtics players to comment after the game that 
Boston fans are the best they've ever seen.  
Oh wait, did you mean for the pathetic lazy good for nothing underachieving 
overpaid spoiled Red Sox?  Never happen.

It's apples and oranges, but not because it's the Celtics.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not the basketball specialist on this thread, but if I recall the Celtics
made the conference semis.  A better analogy would be if they were 10-20 in an 8
2 game season where it didn't look like they'd recover for the playoffs and
they held on at the end of a close game against a good team.

Bear in mind the Cubs love playing games during 92 degree afternoons 
instead of 78 degree evenings, and their fans love to go those games.  
I think it has something to do with the anti-perspirent endorsement deals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for Dempster, right now he's trying to get traded to a good team.  
Do you know one that might want him for a couple of months at the end of the year?

This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see

The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

1) A bit of press, a bit of moves, note there are no summer retreats, you're
welcome to move on to Fall if you like.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to WORLD): Our focus has been on the Queen's Jubilee rather than 
diplomacy in Europe the past month.  Apologies all around!  
Appears as though we aren't the only power that has been distracted, though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY): The battle for Europe is winding down.   
Maybe it’s time for a shake up?  Maybe not.  Attrition seems to be the name of the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AH-WORLD): You can put lipstick on a pig... it's still a pig...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE):  Hopefully you have improved the ciphers on your communications.  
Our policy isn't to spy on our friends, but when you put Top Secret messages 
into the wrong diplomatic pouch we have no choice, but to read it!  
Neither of us built a fleet so I assume we are still friends.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB OPINES): Ducks are well known for feathering the wrong nests....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JAMES to WILLIAMS): There needs to be better earlier communication.  
I hope we didn't get crossed up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITHACA to PROVIDENCE): Oh, you think we're doing all this for your
amusement, young man?  You think we spent all this money and invested
years of our planning and toiling just so you could sit there and
giggle, boy?  One day, sonny, we'll be as gone as Geocities and you'll
be all alone realizing how good you once had it.  You'll be writing
press to yourself and writing orders stabbing yourself just to imagine
that something interesting is going on.  Hmph.  Go clean up your
zineroom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PROVIDENCE to ITHACA AND EVERYONE ELSE): This month, we came up against the 
<i>Diplomacy World</i> deadline and a rash of these "communication issues".
This made these results a bit late.  
But believe you me, I fully intend to keep going.

(BERLIN-PARIS): Your dear ol' dad's desire was that France and Germany would be allied for the rest of the game.  You're going against his wishes, prodigal son, so it appears war is unavoidable.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I did get Fall orders from everyone, so we have continued forward.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) And that takes us to Al's victory!  Congratulations, Al, for sticking this
out to the solo!!!
I'll have a Supply Center Chart next time and solicit endgame statements.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i>
Well, the Supreme Court decision is in on the Affordable Care Act.  
I wasn't at all confident in my prediction, but I dead on nailed how the
case was actually decided, right to Chief Justice Roberts calling the 
mandate penalty a tax and the striking down of the Medicaid provision.
I had lots of people afterward saying I should have bet on it, but I 
probably wouldn't have, even if I could have, since I really didn't 
think my prediction would happen.
The debate we're now having in individual states over whether they're 
going to allow the Medicaid coverage expansion is precisely the political
battle they should have, and the variation we'll see will represent the
political power set-up in those states.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I now go back to work on some of the various implementation issues in the ACA,
and that allows us to go to the next steps of the healthcare debate we need to have.
Part of that debate that's particularly interesting to me remains about whether
we should have physicians be physicians or try to manage the health care system.
We actually pay physicians too much to have them spend time managing, 
and they tend to like interacting with
each other too much to spend all their time interacting with all the other sorts
of health care providers that are multiplying out there.
What fun, never a dull moment for me... it was one of the many reasons why this issue 
was so late, sorry about that.  Down to two games left.  
Keep me in business and fill a new game!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Roberts' reasoning was really intriguing, since we have "loss aversion" 
you don't want to take Medicaid away from people after you give it to them, 
so the Medicaid ruling gives states like Texas an out to not expand Medicaid. 
THEN, you argue that your taxes are being sucked out into other states 
that are doing the Medicaid expansion and focus the political argument 
for overturning the law in general or on those costly pieces.
