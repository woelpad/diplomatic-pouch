<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.  
Join the tidal wave of Dippers going to 
World DipCon in Chicago in August, we can overwhelm Shark Chum with 330 warm bodies!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue establishes the continuation of the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug will keep us on schedule so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

Jim,

This is turning out to be a fun sports year.  
My Giants came out of nowhere to win the Super Bowl!  
I was thrilled when they beat the Cowboys to win the division and would have been 
more than satisfied if they had lost in the first round of the post season.  
Of course, the team I care the most about is SU basketball.  
They are #2 in the country and winning the Big East.  
They have a chance to go undefeated at home which certainly has made 
it a great year to be a season ticket holder.  
Expectations are properly sky high and anything less than a Final Four 
berth will be a major disappointment to Orange Nation.  
I think they have a good shot at the Final Four, but they certainly aren't a shoe in.  
They have issues in terms of rebounding and shooting threes.  
Their zone defense is especially strong this year and is the bedrock of their success.  
While they have depth, that aspect is over-hyped.  
Basically only 7 players are getting any minutes.  
The "bench scoring" stat is highly misleading as CJ Fair comes off the bench, 
but is playing more minutes than any other player on the team.  
The "starter", Christmas, only plays for about 2 minutes a 
game - he is typically out of the game before the first media time out.  
The fact that two McDonalds All Americans are sitting the pine, though, 
is a good indication of SU's experience and talent level, though.  
Given the success of the Giants and SU, at times I dare to believe that maybe, 
just maybe, the Mets could overachieve this year and actually be simply 
bad - or even mediocre, rather than god awful.  
I know, I know, that is probably too much to hope for...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((You may want to join our little baseball prediction group,
that will come next issue, as usual!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I sure am glad that SU is heading out of the Big East.  What a mess!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've started listening to XM radio more frequently these 
days - more specifically "Alt Nation".  
I've enjoyed listening to "new for me" bands such as 
The Bombay Bicycle Club and The Wombats.   
I particularly enjoy the Wombats song "Let's Dance to Joy Division" not 
just because it is a great song in its own right, 
but also gets me thinking about my all time favorite band (along with New Order).  
Speaking of New Order, it is too bad that they have had a 
falling out which seems to finally be the end of the band.  
I'm OK with that given their age, but I'm still hoping that 
they release the outtakes from their last album to put a final wrapper on the band.

Hello- I wanted to let you know that a new The Goblin Market album, 
<i>Beneath Far Gondal's Foreign Sky</i> will be released in early March 
on Seattle's Green Monkey records.  I normally don't endorse albums, 
but this one is special.  The third Goblin Market record-by Jeff Kelly 
and Laura Weller of the Green Pajamas (who Cathy and I know personally, 
we've been to several of their shows)-is their best yet.  
I bought an advance copy and was so impressed I had to listen to it twice in a row.  
Haunting and achingly beautiful, the 12 well crafted songs of this 
concept album are so integrated, 
with one flowing into the next, that one has to listen to it whole 
to appreciate the full context. 
The overall mood is melancholy, like their two preceding albums, 
but there is just enough rock interspersed to wake things up. 
Listening to this record is like being inside a movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If interested, you can buy a copy of the record on CD from:

Thanks to everyone and to the great TempleCon hosts, I reserved one crash room and that
ended up with four people in it, Rob Premus, Carl Ellis, Alex Amann, and Phil Weissert.
I think having a crash room is a really important part of helping travelers who
come from a distance to the con.

<br />This is also the first tournament in the regional sub-Grand Prix tournament 
that is in its fourth year that we've dubbed the "Nor'Easter".  
The next tournament in that group is Boston Massacre in Cambridge in June;
HuskyCon in August; and Carnage, November in Vermont. 
We will again have a First Place Nor'Easter prize to be awarded and with more help from
Robert Rousse (Carnage co-organizer), Second and Third Place prizes as well.  
Phil Weissert, of course, was the tournament winner as well as Best England,
Best France, and Best Germany (taking the unofficial Western Triple!!!). 
Robert Rousse was Best Austria (which I just delivered to him in person at TotalCon),
David Burgess was Best Italy, Rob Premus was Best Russia and Best Turkey
(taking the unofficial Juggernaut).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Drop Dead Time Deadlines: These worked like a charm again, this is the way to play
tournament dip, you're always moving, no waiting around while people write orders.  
The games really moved along, I again used my loud voice with reminders to people 
as needed, and people respected other players' space with need for order writing time.  
And the atmosphere was great.  I ended up going again with the 17 minute spring, 15 minute 
fall continually running clock.    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lastly, more experience on selling Diplomacy on site: I was still not as successful as
I would like to be here, both from within other people already attending TempleCon as
well as travelers.  So I'm going to be asking about some other ideas shortly.
Stay tuned. 
I didn't try walking around the Con playing Edi Birsan's 
Teaching Videos from You Tube again like I did three years ago.... don't believe me, yes, 
I really, really did this three years ago, but it didn't really gain anything but laughs,
especially from the miniatures players,
so I didn't do that this time around, but I did play it some in our Diplomacy corner. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now we look forward to World DipCon in Chicago in August, see you all there, I hope!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) An IF RAGE draw (that is all survivors) is proposed.  IF RAGE, then what?
Please vote with your summer orders and if you don't vote the draw is rejected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DUCK to GAME):  I didn't realize when Boob called this a "memorial" it 
was a reference to "time immemorial" and the ongoing and forever nature 
of such things.  
I swear we will all be collecting pensions by the time this is over.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM to GAME AND DUCK):  Are those just the same thing?  Is Duck Game?  
Or is a Duck Game??  Or is THE Duck Game???   At least we have more
staying power than Tim Tebow...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TEBOW TIME):  The Wall Street Journal isn't known for its sense of
humor.  But one WSJ columnist recently gave Tim Tebow a nice subtle
dig to lead off a column that wasn't even about sports:  "The Lord
works in mysterious ways, or so it is often said.  But in an era when
few can read His signs, those signs have a way of becoming a bit more
obvious.  Like 45-10."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to AUSTRIA):  The only thing I clearly remember about this 
game is your treachery.  Death to the Hapsburgs!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JAMES to WORLD):  The game seems to have lost momentum and interest.  
If you agree, please vote for the draw.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IL DUCHY DU NORMANDIE to LEGHORN):  See?  I told you this would be fun.  
About as much fun as having dragons tattooed on your face.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DUCHY to MONDE):  An inside reference to our misspent youth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MONDE): I have a published article in French, you know...
I just found it the other day.
I was sitting around with Robert Rousse and Alex Amann on Friday
and talking about
what the proper definition of geek/nerd was.  We all agreed that if you were 
spending lots of time between age 16-24 playing Go, Diplomacy, or running
Dungeon and Dragons expeditions instead of chasing girls, the answer was clear.
I know which category I was in... which led to...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to GM):  Your Google profile gives your photo plus "Senior
Investigator".  Do you now investigate seniors?  Is this part of the
Obamacare Health Mandate Death Panel takeover?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM to RUSSIA): It's actually a real job title, I also have the job 
title Professor... BUT I do qute a lot of investigation of seniors
and have been publishing papers promoting things
that the Right call "Death Panels".  The physicians like to call them 
"Palliative Care Consults" which to my economist mind is part of the
problem.
When faced with the choice in the press of calling something a palliative
care consult or a death panel, which would YOU choose??
We're finally starting to understand that language matters, and of 
course negative words ring truest, even to people who SWEAR they are
unbiased and don't pay attention to the language tone.
I have blog comments as well as published papers on these questions if
you felt like hunting around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SAUGUS to PROVIDENCE):  You guys started re-planning the Great White 
Trash Tour through California yet?  We’re waiting for you...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PROVIDENCE to SAUGUS): In short, no, we haven't.  I sent you guys a 
bit more detailed private message for the game.  
Everyone should come to World DipCon to see me, and we have to get
Charlotte excited again about the idea.
I think she doesn't really want to think about "that time" again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to WEST):  I trust we all joined together to hold off the Russia/AH steamroller.  
If not, the Mongolian hoards will be in London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome before too long...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to DREW):  Thanks for... you know what.  
If the GM can get out another move by, say, the 4th of July, 
we have a chance of remembering enough to keep the bayonettes 
all pointed in the right direction.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DON): You KNOW that Doug will not allow me to miss deadlines
any more...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JUST A PLAYER to TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR):  There was a "Chris Martin"
arrested for DWI in the Ithaca area yesterday.  I had to check to make
sure it was a local person and not a visiting dance instructor at IC
or Cornell.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(COME TO WORLD DIPCON ANYWAY): He's not Chris Martin unless he
stabs for solos.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to MIKE):  Nice to see you’re still around.  Too bad you’re doing so well.  
I always liked you better when your country was smaller than mine.  
Things were always much safer that way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PIRATE RADIO, OFF THE COAST OF GASCONY):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, I don't know why I'm still in this game,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just know that Boob is surely to blame.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Been so long I can't remember my name,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Late again, oh yeah it's always the same...

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Yes I'm stuck in the middle with Drew.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 And I'm wonderin' what it is I should do,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's so hard to keep this game on my mind,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My old zines I'm sure I never will find,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doug always pesters me,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Boob's out of sight,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here I am stuck in this pile of... doo.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Well, we started off with promise,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And we ended in this no man's land.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
'Cause the game's gone on forever,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And we're sure the pain will never,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ea-ee-ee-ee-eese... ea-ee-ee-ee-eese.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tryin' to make some sense of it all,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's been years between the spring and the fall,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I want to play so I can even the score,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who to stab?  Who can recall any more?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's just not much left of me,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It ain't cool - it ain't right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here I am, stuck in this muddle with Boob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah I'm, fucked in this puzzle by Boob.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, we started back in '06 –-

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Back when Bush was still the president,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now I won't say this game's a bore,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But Obama's nearly done his four,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ze... Gee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ze...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, I don't know why I'm writing this press,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I guess I still got some things to address,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm so scared I'll lose my mind and forget,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why I'm here, well at least I wouldn't regret...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clowns to the left of me,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jokers to the right,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here I am, stuck in `Phil Reynolds' with you

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yes, I'm stuck in `Phil Reynolds' with you...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, we're sucked into this muddle by Boob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, we're fucked in this puzzle with Boob...

1) Now, we would like to see some more endgame statements if we could, I've
printed the full game SC chart and would like to print more endgame statements
in the next issue.
I think Bruce also is going to say that he is retiring from Diplomacy
with this game (I hope he doesn't).
Bruce has promised me an endgame statement, so we'll keep this game on the
books for one more issue.
Remember, this game began in 1999, thirteen years ago!!!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I just noted the three last moves that take the last three sets of points.
Rick Desper wins with 51 points, a brilliant balanced play!!!
Alex Woo finishes second with 44 points.
Tom Howell had the highest number of replenishments (meaning he has 
a lot of great cards unused in his hands) but finishes third with 
29 points.
Andy York plugs along and finishes fourth with 17 points.
Brendan Whyte finishes fifth, and Dave Partridge brings up the rear as
he gets off the schneide on this last turn, but still doesn't pass Brendan.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) So far, Andy York is the only one interested in another game of this??
I'd like to get six again.  I left everything else here for one more issue
in case you'd like to write endgame statements.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick Santorum said today that, "I don’t believe that the separation of church 
and state is absolute. 
The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means 
bringing people and their faith into the public square."
Interesting idea... one of the things that bothers me when people say 
things like that (I don't know if Rick Santorum believes this) is whether
they think they are "following the founding fathers" in doing so.
I always go back to James Madison when I'm seeking wisdom on this.
Here are some quotes from Madison that illustrate what the separation
of church and state is about:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from 
these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of 
Europe with blood for centuries." (note that includes both civil and
nation warfare, and it promotes the diversity of religions healthy for society)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The number, the industry, and the morality of the priesthood, 
and the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by 
the total separation of the church from the state." (research in the
present day clearly shows this to be true, Madison was a great sensemaker,
and so those who favor religious faith communities should support this idea,
lest they end up with the faith society in places like Scandinavia that
scare them so much)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And finally, and most importantly: "The truth is that all men having
power ought to be mistrusted." (never forget that one, and it ties the 
first two together)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Interestingly, there is a tenet
among thoughtful faithful people that strong faith communities bring diverse
contradictory political beliefs together without personal judgments upon
one another, not a bad goal for a democratic society either.
I honestly don't understand what Rick Santorum wants.
