<br /><br />23 TUNES GAME STARTS THIS ISSUE!!!  IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO JOIN, CHECK IN NOW THOUGH!!!
Orders for the next turn due December 2nd.
I've moved all the deadlines for next issue to December 2nd, since trying to rush them 
all in before Thanksgiving would not have worked, and I will be away for the 
holiday celebrating my parents' 50th Wedding Anniversary.
My brother David, the rest of the family and I are going on a little cruise.
That seems to be the popular way to celebrate these big family events these
days.
I'm going to have a good time, though it wouldn't be what I would have chosen.
This gives you ALL time to catch up in getting things to me, so get things to me!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Big apologies to Michael Lowrey, the last time he sent his subszine along, he sent 
two issues at once.  I decided to print one and save the second one.... 
then I promptly proceeded to misplace the second one.  
He tries to get caught up this time by sending me another copy of the "never printed
one plus a new one.
No way am I walking into THAT trap again, you get both issues in THIS issue of <i>TAP</i>.
And where does the name <i>Houdini Blues</i> come from again???
And what is the Rhode Island connection for that name???
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
We have another exciting issue of <i>By the Way</i> in this issue if everything
is going as planned.
We're making progress on starting new games, help fill things up, see below for more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter now seems to be sliding back into stasis!
Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack,
but Rip also has been missing in action completely for over a year now, 
I don't have an update but he
and Dave Partridge communicate. 
Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARGARET GEMIGNANI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, now, why Margaret?  Margaret, of course, is one of the most famous personalities in 
Dipdom, Science Fiction, Star Trek, Comic, etc. fandom.  
She was a nurse in the DC area, I believe, and then retired to Florida some years ago.
Many people had an address for her in Fort Lauderdale (including me), but that address
went missing around 1994.
If you do Google searching, as I have done off and on, there is a Margaret Gemignani
that contributes to the Baltimore and Ohio Historical Railroad Association, along with 
a husband, Gino (anyone know if that matches.... the B&amp;O matches where she used to live...
but don't tell me, use it as info to go looking yourself!!!)
Margaret has a couple of mentions in the Diplomacy AtoZ and I first encountered her
in the old Bernie Oaklyn <i>Le Front</i> szine.
I think it would be fun to find her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jeff, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jeff Key or Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<b>WORLDMASTERS04 SECTION</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer, Doug Moore,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.
Actually, the Semifinal games began in October.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen anything on progress in these games,
and that's why.
More on that next issue!!!
Thomas Franke and David Partridge are in a game together that seems
on first glance to be the weakest in the rest of the players.
So my first thought is that one of those two will have a slot in
the finals.
I am getting raked over the coals for it, but I just ended a game
in a three way draw between me, Thomas, and Ray Setzer that I might
have had a chance in ekeing out a win mostly because Thomas asked
for it to end so he could focus on this semi-final.
Sorry, David, but I had to do it.....
Of course, after saying that, David Partridge is in England getting beaten
on by Guy Thomas in France, who is allied with Thomas Franke in Italy.
But Italy has a Juggernaut bearing down on him from Mike Tombu and
Julio Cardoza.
And Toby Harris just got crunched in his game where he is Turkey, but
I don't count him out yet, he has more lives than a cat!!
But never mind, I don't know how ANY of this will turn out!!!
Doug Moore is doing pretty well as Russia in his game so far, but
Russia can always be crunched after doing well early.
Buffalo is doing pretty well in his game as France taking down Germany
and now attacking Adam Silverman's England, I think, that part is still
developing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where some of this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
I had to go the main Worldmasters site at www.worldmasters.net/wm04/ to
find some of these results.
The new Tournament rankings for FTF also are out there that supercede the
ones that were on 18centres.
Go check out:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://eurodip.nuxit.net/php/ranking/affiche_ranking.php?id_ranking=3&amp;lang=Ang

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It ranks 4788 FTF players and is the most complete known compilation of FTF play
ever in the hobby.
You really want to check it out.
Poor Eve Smith ends up 4788th, having been in 33 tournaments in the last ten years,
an achievement in itself!
And of course Don Del Grande is down near the bottom at 4784th, off of 13 tournaments,
two of them in Australia.
For having the Don Challenge Cup named after him, he didn't do THAT badly in his
tournaments Down Under, better than I'd been led to believe at 54/78 and 34/57
And Frank Johansen is a well deserved #1.
And I'm amazingly in the top quarter with a ranking of 1171, accurately reflecting
the nine tournaments that I know I've been to (i.e. I don't see any missing).
Yann Clouet (if I counted right) has been to 95 tournaments, I'd be surprised if
someone surpasses him in number, and he ranks 9th.
Guaranteed to be a fun browse....

<i>((After Edi Birsan's retort to Mark Lew about the "naming of the Lepanto opening" 
and the history of the actual Lepanto, Mark comes back to Edi....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark Lew (Sat, 4 Nov 2006 14:48:11 -0800)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I happen to have my nose in Ottoman history this afternoon, and I
suddenly remembered I meant to answer whoever it was in <i>TAP</i> that tried
to defend the name of the Lepanto opening, saying something like, "it
really was a major naval victory of Italy over Turkey".  I have no
problem with the name of the opening.  I think it's cute, but that
statement is wrong.
<i>((That would be Edi Birsan..... "JC" in the Diplomacy AtoZ (is that
John Caruso??? If not, who???) also has weighed in on this and 
says: "The battle of Lepanto was not strictly 
fought by an Italy-Austria coalition but by a Spain-Papacy-Venice coalition, 
in which the main Navy was the Spanish one. Italy was not yet a nation, 
but a myriad of small states (as Machiavelli portrays so well). 
The association of Austria to this battle was by their close relations 
with the Spanish monarchy, so it is not wrong to mention them. 
Moreover, the Spanish Admiral who led this battle was known as Juan of Austria, 
half brother of the Spanish King Philip II, 
son of Emperor Charles I of Spain and V of Germany. 
Of course the translation of this fact into the game of Diplomacy suits 
perfectly with an Italy-Austria alliance."
So this has been discussed before, but let's hear your take on it....))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can set aside the fact that the losers in the battle were the
Ottoman Empire and not "Turkey", since the yellow pieces in Dip also
really should have been "Ottoman" and not "Turk".  But the victor
wasn't Italy either. The driving force behind the expedition was the
Spanish Habsburgs, and what they were fighting over was the *western*
Mediterranean. Spain's naval power was expanding and they were ready to
drive the Ottomans and their client states out of their backyard on the
North African coast (which Lepanto did succeed in doing, more or less).
Toward this end, they enlisted the Pope (who is not "Italy") and
gathered up a Catholic alliance which raised the forces and funds for a
naval expedition to chase down the Ottoman fleet. Prominent in the
alliance, particularly in financing, was Venice (which is also not
"Italy").  As condition for their participation, Venetians commanded a
majority of the squadrons (I forget the exact breakdown); the unified
commander of the expedition was neither Spanish nor Venetian, but a
Habsburg prince of the Austrian line.
<i>((Is that Juan of Austria you're talking about???))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The battle was won and the Ottoman fleet was destroyed, but it didn't
end Ottoman naval power in the Eastern Mediterranean. The fleet was
completely rebuilt within two years and was winning victories again on
the coast of Greece soon after. The fact that the victory had little
long-term effect is a result of the nature of the alliance. Venice at
that time (the beginning of its decline) was playing a balance-of-power
game. Venice benefited from a contested Mediterranean. The Ottomans had
become too strong, so Venice allied with Spain. After Lepanto, the
Spanish leaders were eager to follow up the victory by striking
Constantinople and the Ottoman heartland while it was undefended. But
Venice didn't want Spain to dominate the sea either, so they stoutly
refused to cooperate and that was the end of it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's your Lepanto in a nutshell.  The idea that it was a victory of
Italians over Turks is an invention of 19th century Italian
nationalism.

I had a great time playing all sorts of boardgames and cardgames at PLAY 
2006 recently (14-17 September).  This was in Syracuse, NY so I hope we 
can recruit your brother next year.  It's invitational-only but Dave 
would be a good fit with these people.  The Syracuse local gamers have a 
friendly and sportsmanlike group that meets weekly.  I might go up 
occasionally for those Tuesday evenings.  The other out-of-towners were 
good folks too.  I knew Alan Moon from his early-1980s Avalon Hill work 
helping Diplomacy players and GMs, and later from a couple of the 
Linseys' housecons.  I've known Donna Balkan from housecons and WBC/WDC 
forever (though spouse Jim couldn't make it).  People came from Texas, 
Ohio, and Massachusetts as well as a few parts of NYS.  Three dozen or 
so, some of whom were only there for a day or two of the four-day gig.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here's my list.  Played 23 games with three repeats = 20 different 
titles.  Learned 13 games.  Taught one game twice and taught another 
game once.  Won less than my share but came in second out of 4-5 players 
more than my share.  I learned those with an asterisk.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* PROPHECY [Altar], (did a crossword puzzle not counted in game stats), 
* VIKTORY II [Morrison Games], Ta Yu, Ra, Alhambra, * THE PATRONS OF 
VENICE [Toccata Games], * MASONS [Hans im Gluck/Rio Grande], Basari, * 
BUS [Splotter], * ALPHA TO OMEGA (group party game at the icebreaker), 
Fabrik der Traume, * EMIRA [Phalanx/Mayfair], * BURN IN HELL [Steve 
Jackson Games], * ZIG-ZAG [Kosmos/Rio Grande], Zig-Zag again, * 
CARROUSEL [Asmodee], Tadsch Mahal, * IN10SITY [Simply Fun], Louis XIV, 
Ta Yu (taught 2-player first time, taught others 3-player this time), * 
HELL RAIL [Mayfair], Scrabble, * LASS DIE KIRCHE INS DORF [Mucke 
Autorenrechte].

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I donated an over twenty-year-old copy of BRITANNIA (I was disappointed 
to check the copyright date and find it wasn't quite an antique) to the 
prize table, and from the prize table I got a Mystery Bag, DRAGON DELTA, 
and the New York Times' CROSSWORD.  The Mystery Bag was a 
Kokopelli-themed drawstring-goodies-pouch, holding a CARCASSONNE 
expansion (The Count of C...), a 65-card deck (regular plus a fifth 
suit), and I think there was a simple set-collecting card game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots of new friends, good times, new games, old favorites, no tournament 
stress, cruddy hotel located convenient to 90 and 81.  I'm very glad I 
went.  Next year it'll be the weekend before or after Memorial weekend, 
elsewhere in Syracuse.  I intend to schedule vacation days for it again.

We're running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!

<br /><br />
<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
late.
Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number) is, in alphabetical order, 
Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper, Steve Emmert, Doug Kent, Dick Martin, Richard Smith, Brendan Whyte, and Brad Wilson.
Most people have some kind of linking theme to their sets, I'll let you figure
them out.
I have added some kind of comment on each tune.
I've not given any tune bonus points this first time around, but if any of you not
only guess the author, but also guess their linking theme, I'll give you an extra
point.  For the ones who have a potentially "hard to figure out theme", if no one
gets it, I'll give YOU a point.
Deadline is December 2nd, 2006.
WHAT I NEED: two more tunes (five if you're joining up new), your guesses as to who
submitted which lists, and guesses about people's themes if any.
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #1:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The "Hallelujah" Chorus from Handel's "Messiah":
The title tells you what the words are, and the middle few bars are 
so famous, but how many people, apart from those that sing it, know 
the whole movement? A great little number this, boppy and exciting to 
sing, to sing along to, or just to tap ones fingers to on the 
steering wheel while caught in traffic, though with the new bridge to 
replace the Woodrow Wilson drawbridge in DC should ease the latter at least.
<i>((As I've said before, I most prefer the John Eliot Gardner version
(Philips R 215049, 1983) with the light clarity of tone that I'm trying
to develop right now in my own singing.
John Eliot Gardner's recording with the Monteverdi Choir of the 
Dixit Dominus by Handel (Erato, 1992) is even better to illustrate this point.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) "Libera Me" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Requiem":
The final movement of this impressive modernist-classical piece 
leaves the boy soprano on his own to hold pitch and rhythm singing 
about eternal peace, when the organ comes crashing in over him with 
dissonance and gusto trying to drown him out in chaos, but its waves 
of noise break and underneath the sweet high "perpertua" carries on. 
It's a brave young lad who can maintain that, especially in any live 
performance in front of an audience. But live or recorded, this is 
great music and a fascinating musical analogy of peace and goodness 
and light triumphing over noise and chaos.
<i>((I've heard about five attempts in recent years to compose a Requiem,
quite a difficult task to do.
Even as I quibble with A.L. Webber on many points in how he composes his
other more popular music, this is easily the best of those Requiems.
And no, I'm not even counting Paul McCartney's Ecce Com Meum composition.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) "Mau Kamu Suka Kamu" by Rano Karno:
An interesting delve into singing by TV presenter Karno comes up 
trumps with this sugary but fun silly love song in a disco-dangdut 
style (one could never call Karno himself `dangdut', he's too 
respectable!). Mothers and daughters will sing along in the catchy 
chorus. A difficult track to find outside Java, but worth the effort 
of hunting down, especially to see the expression on the faces of 
expat Indonesians when you play it!
<i>((I have a strange soft spot for silly love songs, you know.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #2: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) "Haunted" by Poe: An honorable attempt to deal with her
father's death.  Really the whole album is.
<i>((You all know how much I grew up on complex layers of sound and
this 2000 release was the best of that genre in that year by far.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) "Can You Do It" by Grand Funk Railroad: Produced by
Frank Zappa, from their final studio album of the
original incarnation (1976's Good singing, Good Playing)
<i>((People forget how focused and talented a producer Frank Zappa was.
This year's Zappa Plays Zappa led by Dweezil was one of the musical happenings
of the year... of course I did NOT get to see it, but I hope some of you did.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) "Tempus Fugit" by Yes: Trevor Horn takes vocals on this
album, Drama, instead of Jon Anderson, prior to his
stint as opening act on MTV in The Buggles.  One of
the ten best true rock songs of all time.
<i>((You probably all know how much I like the Buggles,
and Yes was the very first rock concert I ever went to in person,
before Trevor Horn joined the group, of course.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #3:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) "White Rhino Tea" by the Ozric Tentacles: Starting this off slow with
an instrumental by this jazzy space rock band from 1991.  Six minutes of
dreamy, haunting sonic tapestry, and the first cut off of what I think is their best
album, <i>Strangeitude</i>.
<i>((Most of the progressive rock like this which I like is much earlier
than this, Bob Olsen and I, for example, are huge Klaus Schulze fans, but
the Tentacles fit well into this genre and are worthy successors.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) "The Secret of Bethany's Mouth" by the Green Pajamas: This psych pop
masterpiece is the latest from this veteran group, 
from the 2005 release <i>21st Century Seance</i> that naturally is about
various kinds of ghost stories, following up on the theme.
Green Pajamas remain possibly the best of the many bands continuing to plumb the 
new psychedelia.
This song has as its main inspiration the romantic mystery novel
"Pale as the Dead" by Fiona Mountain and as a folky feel to it.
<i>((Since Eric Ozog isn't in the game (at least so far) I can tell you
that this is Eric's favorite band and they hail, naturally, from Seattle.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) "The Pictures on My Wall" by Echo and the Bunnymen: 1979 beginning of the 
McCulloch boys is fresh and exciting when heard today.
There is even a hint of Joy Division-ness in them on this cut.
This first single was unavailable anywhere I knew about until the mid-1990's,
since the early vinyl printing was small.
<i>((I was happy to see someone select this song, not many people have ever
heard it, but to us Bunnymen fans this is an essential pickup.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #4:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) "6 Underground" by Sneaker Pimps: If you know Sneaker Pimps, 
then you're way too cool for me.  But "6U" is a terrific tune.
<i>((Ah, lots of people are selecting psychedelic or electropop sorts of things.
"6U" is from their first and probably best album, I think it reached #6 on
the British pop charts, was less popular here in the States.
Its various members are presently scattered around doing all sorts of side
or separate projects.
From what I know, none of that is producing anything terribly exciting, which
is too bad.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" by the Allman Brothers Band:
"Liz Reed" is the tune that, in my mind, definitively proves that the 
Allman Brothers were in reality jazz musicians.  It's their tribute to Miles Davis.
<i>((I haven't heard this since I was in college in the 1970's and had my 
jazz show on the radio station.
I never played this song on that, to my recollection, but I do remember it 
being an extended drum solo by Trucks and being quite striking.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) "Spanish Sky" by Chris Isaak:
"Spanish Sky" is from <i>Heart Shaped World</i>, the album 
(back then, they still called them albums) that made Isaak famous with the 
single, "Wicked Game."  I doubt I could ever get tired of that CD.
<i>((I don't think this is my thing, and I think everyone will know this list 
isn't mine when
I say that I think I remember "Wicked Game" but I'm positive I've never heard the 
whole CD.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #5:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Pure Reason Revolution - The Bright Ambassadors of Morning:
So, you're a promising new pop band with a (currently) trendy retro-rock
stylee. You've just been signed to Sony-BMG, one of the biggest labels in
the world. It's single time. You choose to go for a 12-minute epic
masterpiece. Music biz suicide? No! Everyone loves it.
<i>((And worthy successors to Pink Floyd, Genesis, and other bands who did it
before them.
There's nothing wrong with 12 minutes.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Mastodon - Siberian Divide:
One of America's up and coming metal bands, Mastodon have gone a bit arty
with their "Blood Mountain" album to great effect. It's hard to pick a best
track, but this is my favorite.
<i>((Metal seems to be making a comeback, in new and interesting "arty" ways.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Wolverine - Liar on the Mount:
This track is from the Swedish prog-mettalers' 2006 album "Still". It
features spoken passages from none other than Mr. George W. Bush. How dare
they lambast the leader of the free world! Oh well why not, everyone else
does and the track is really good. Oddly, the first time I heard this track,
the tone of Dubya's voice reminded me of the guy on Mylo's "Destroy Rock and
Roll" who rattles off a list of musical artists that are "evil", including
David Boowie and Cindy Looper.
<i>((No, say it ain't so?
W.??
The real question about lies is the relationship between lies and propaganda.
If no one calls you on it - not really - is it a lie or just spin?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #6:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) "Baker Street" by Gerry Rafferty:
I have always liked "Baker Street", which has one of the most 
famous sax riffs in pop music.  
It was big on MTV in the early 80s when videos were young.
<i>((Yes, indeed, and I am a huge sax fan, at that time, I was much more of a Saxa
fan with the English Beat, but this one is more famous than Saxa's on, say,
"Mirror in the Bathroom".))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Waterloo by Abba:
"Waterloo" is one of the ABBA songs that was <i>not</i> on my Dad's ABBA 
8-track tape that he'd play in the car in the 70s.  
His collection consisted of one 8-track apiece from ABBA, John Denver, The Beach 
Boys, and Helen Reddy.  That was it, I think.  After having that beaten into 
my head for about five years I developed a bit of an antipathy to the group, 
but that's faded in recent years.  When I moved to <i>((place name 
censored since it might give away who this is))</i> I rediscovered 
the group, since they were still big in the dance clubs in a retro way.  
Of course "Dancing Queen" was the big hit.  Didn't hear "Waterloo" 
until I saw "Muriel's Wedding", the film that inspired the musical 
"Mamma Mia".  Both are filled with ABBA tunes.  
<i>((My dad really did have this 8-track collection
you'll have to figure out if that means this is my list
or that my father and this person's father had the same 8-track tape taste.
And "Muriel's Wedding" and "Mamma Mia" are both worthy vehicles for this
infectious music!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Angel by Sarah McLachlan:
"Angel" has been the title of a number of songs.  
I picked the Sarah McLachlan song after listening to a few since it sounded nice.  
<i>((I also like the P.P. Arnold version of "Angel of the Morning", but that's
more than just Angel - there is a theme in this one, in case you can't tell....
and I think Sarah is just that "nice".
I'll bet she's nice and down to earth in person too.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #7:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Mem Shannon, "Taxicab Driver" (from "A Cab Driver's Blues", Hannibal/Rykodisc, 
1995): Blues is not necessarily a native New Orleans form of music: 
the blues' roots in the Mississippi Delta took it north to Memphis, Kansas City 
and (most of all) Chicago. But take gritty urban blues, the swampy, funky 
second-line rhythm that fuels New Orleans music and a sharp wit typical of 
New Orleans, and the result is a song like this: 
funny, foot-tapping and utterly charming. Shannon's expressive voice 
and distinctive guitar sound (Albert Collins meets Wes Montgomery) 
make this one a treat.
<i>((Many people think that this sort of music all sounds the same, they're
completely nuts.
The range of potential emotions is immense and fundamentally isn't music about
emotion.
It's just emotion.... or is that the motion.
Sorry, can't resist a Ghod reference.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The Kinks, "Catch Me Now I'm Falling" (from "One from the Road", 
recorded 1979, released 1980, Konk Records): I always thought the 
Kinks rocked harder and wrote sharper lyrics than the (to me) 
overrated Beatles, and here's the proof. This whole live album 
glistens and sizzles with intensity and passion, and the band never 
sounded tighter. The song is that rare bird, a political song from 
the late 1970's still sadly relevant; its ferocious lyrics sum 
up Jimmy Carter-malaise era U.S.A. well, and they are just as apt 
today for the running disaster that is Bushism. 
Dave Davies never sounded better on lead guitar than here.
<i>((I know there are Beatles fans of this generation - resident <i>TAP</i>pites
Keith Sherwood and Peter Sullivan most definitely included - but a lot of people
didn't remember that the Kinks were making relevant music in the Elvis Costello
era.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Eartha Kitt, "Let's Do It" (from "Eartha Kitt Purr-fect Greatest Hits, 
7N Records, 1998; recorded 5 October 1953, with Henri Rene &amp; 
His Orchestra): Cole Porter, that old sybarite and matchless wit, 
must have loved this: the ever-slinky Miss Kitt turning a Porter 
tune about falling in love into something else entirely - let's 
just say Kitt's throaty delivery and arch-seductive voice obviously take
the "it" of the title to mean somnething more, er, basic. 
This snappy, hot little number is a textbook case of how to take a 
standard and make it your own. Kitt - now on Broadway in "Mimi le Duck" - 
is a force of nature, a dazzling entertainer with an utterly 
distinctive voice and great legs for a lady in her 70's.
Her 50's recordings are as sexy and dangerous as anything Elvis ever did.
<i>((And she even played Catwoman on Batman, who can forget that???
And I just noticed after checking that she shortly turns 79, so she's
almost OUT of her 70's.
Lastly, she once played Helen of Troy in the Orson Welles production of
<i>Dr. Faust</i>, it was Welles who saw that her magnetic personality made
her an actress, not just a singer/dancer.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #8:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) "Want-Ad Blues", John Lee Hooker: Sure, there are better-known 
Hooker tunes, like "Boom Boom" and the classic "Boogie Chillun", but 
this is the one I keep coming back to.  Maybe it's the slyly suggestive 
lyrics sung in Hooker's gravelly voice that's always just around but 
not quite on the beat that creates the magnetic tension.  Maybe it's the 
groove so deep "even a white person could get it".  Whatever.  It's easy 
to listen to and hard to sit still for.
<i>((Yes, yes, yes, this music seems so simple, but is so complex....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) "Sing, Sing, Sing", Benny Goodman:  I hadn't heard this tune for ages 
til I heard Los Straitjackets play it in concert a couple years back. 
they ripped into it as a surf guitar instrumental and I kept thinking 
to myself, "I know this song, I know this song...what is it???" then it 
clicked and I was blown away.  It's still as amazingly hot today as it 
was back in the big band days.  Gotta go back to the source and pick the 
original for being so timeless, even though the live Los Straitjackets 
version is about as good.
<i>((I think all of us were not actually alive when Benny Goodman
originally recorded this, or if we were, we weren't really old enough
to pay attention.
It's scary how good and fresh some of that music sounds today in our
world of retreads and recycles.
Cab Calloway is another of the band leaders who made music that sounds
wonderful and amazingly hot today.
for Cab, I recommend the "Are You Hep to the Jive?" CD compilation that
came out a decade ago or so.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) "Blue on a Green Planet", Big Country:  Anthems...nobody does 
anthemic guitar rock as well as Big Country.  Big, loud, wailing guitar 
sounds.  Lyrics that sorta make sense if you don't think about them too 
deeply.  Drench with heartfelt emotion.  Crank it up to 11.  Repeat.
<i>((No one has the big sound down better than these guys.
If you've only heard their eponymous "In a Big Country", the Country is
big enough to hold some other great anthems as well.
Big Country has a conscience too.))</i>

I knew Gaylord Perry.  Gaylord Perry was a friend of mine.  
Kenny Rogers is no Gaylord Perry.  He may be a "first ballot" Hall of Famer 
in the sense that, if he's on the ballot at all, he'll be kicked off 
the first time.  That has nothing to do with his performance in Game 2.  
Rogers is possibly good enough to be on the ballot, but he's nowhere near 
the caliber he would need to be to be considered for the Hall 
(esp. given his history of choking in the postseason.)
<i>((I actually agree, of course.... just making the point that what it
is alleged he did or didn't do to baseballs is not especially relevant to
me, or to the process.))</i>
I was quite annoyed to read a column at ESPN.com which was basically an 
anonymous coach saying that he figured Rogers was cheating the whole game.  
It's one thing to say the fairly obvious thing anonymously, 
but I disliked the further step of expanding the allegations, 
without evidence, under the cover of anonymity.

You guys are pretty quiet about baseball this year.  Hmm...
Momentum is a tricky thing.  So are expectations.  Everyone "expects" that 
the Cardinals will get drilled by the Tigers.  It doesn't mean it *won't* 
happen.  I pick St. Louis to win Game 1, and then Detroit gets the next 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can probably all play back in our head the catch that Willie Mays made in 
the 1954 Series off of Vic Wertz.  The catch that Chavez made in Game 7 of 
the NLCS off of Rolen was as spectacular as that one, but won't be 
remembered as such, since the Mets lost the game.  Too bad.

he's the wrong guy, for the same reasons that Dusty Baker was the wrong guy. 
Why not Girardi, or someone that can build a winner?  I think Cubs' fans are 
now looking at 200 years of frustration.

Don't know quite what to say.  I was thinking that Verlander 
would lose game 1.  He's been off his game recently.  
But I also have been thinking that the Cardinals don't have 
enough pitching from the beginning of the playoffs, 
and I've been wrong from the beginning of the playoffs.  
First it was the Jeff and Jeff show and now Reyes wins in Detroit?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didn't hear any live music all spring and summer.  So when I finally 
heard a concert October 13, my first national act of the year, I did it 
right:  a Rock'n'Roll Hall of Famer, from the second row.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gregg Allman and Friends opened a new tour at Magic City Music Hall in 
Johnson City, New York, where I heard the Ratdog and Rusted Root shows I 
mentioned in my best-of-2005 article.  This was a fine show, all new 
arrangements by Gregg, played tightly considering it was the tour's 
first gig.  Danielia Cotton from New York City opened the show just as 
my cousin and I were up front checking out the big band's equipment, so 
we spent the night up front near stage right, close enough to watch 
musicians play and to see their expressions.  Something like 1500 people 
there but we were never crowded from behind into the rail.  Ms. Cotton 
(http://www.danielia.com/site.php) is the daughter of a jazz singer who 
writes her own rock and soul and blues.  Sometimes she plays with a full 
rock band, but for this show it was just her and one guy on guitars; 
hers was acoustic.  She has one album out, and is working on another.  I 
liked some of the new material, especially "Bang My Drum".  Good songs, 
done with heart.  Recommended.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After Danielia's one set and a short break, Allman came on with six 
other fine musicians.  This tour isn't the Allman Brothers Band with 
Dickie Betts, but guys with about a thousand years a cumulative 
experience with all sorts of rock and blues bands including past Gregg 
Allman "solo" tours:  Mike C. Barnes (guitar), Jay Collins (sax), Jerry 
Jemmott (bass), Neil Larson (keyboard), Floyd Miles (percussion) and 
Steve Potts (drums).  Boy oh boy, could they play.  Barnes would lay out 
the sweetest lines of electric slide guitar, subtle and moving, then rip 
the hottest wails without moving a facial muscle.  "Laconic" is the 
word.  Collins had two saxes, and I swear the bigger one was longer than 
an oboe.  It honked like an elephant lightly farting through its trunk, 
but it was just the ticket in the context where it was used.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Allman did a ton of new arrangements for this tour, and it was obvious.  
This wasn't like hearing a tribute band, or a band running through the 
same version they've been playing for years.  A couple of Allman songs 
were recast to a funk sound, and it worked.  Plenty more tunes were much 
bluesier than the recordings you hear on the radio.  They worked well, 
too.  A couple of vocal mikes gave Gregg bad squeals several times, but 
otherwise, the night went great.  The worst "problem" I had was the new 
arrangements; my neural network kept wanting to dance or lip-sync to the 
rhythms I was used to instead of the ones they were actually playing.  
But I consider "not the same ol'" to be an asset rather than a 
detraction.  They're doing this on the east coast for a couple of weeks 
in October, then taking a break, then touring from November through 
January.  If you get a chance, check it out.  Not just rehashing 
memories, this is creative new work done around the old framework, and 
it's fine to the ear.

ok jim-bob, i'll bite. i'm not entirely sure how the game works, but i 
reckon it'll become obvious as we go along. hmm...to do it "desert 
island" style or just what i'm listening to lately...decisions, 
decisions. i'll tack some entries on at the end of this, but there's a 
lot of catching up to do in the meantime.

for starters, i've moved (a couple times) and am now at 4615 
brookeville rd, brookeville, md 20833. so if you could update your 
address for me, that'd be great. i still have a fondness for reading 
zeens the old fashioned way: on paper. call me old school. i've also 
gotten remarried (once) and changed jobs (about a half dozen times) 
since i checked in last (same sort of govt contracting business, 
though). haven't done much in-person gaming for years, but still amuse 
myself on the computer (mostly diablo2, starcraft, www.neopets.com 
(yes!) and www.nationstates.net).

time passes, and it's a bit weird having my rock'n'roll heroes dying 
from old age instead of the classic drug overdoses. sigh...george 
harrison, john entwistle, joe strummer, most of the ramones, stuart 
adamson (and just when i'd rediscovered the glory of big country, too), 
warren zevon.... all gone. wow. i particularly miss zevon. of all the 
musicians i've listened to, he was the one i most wished i could be. so 
many great songs about drug addicts, mercenaries, psychopaths, 
scoundrels, werewolves, and losers with the occasional splash of pure 
romance and heavy doses of morbid humor, sung in at least seven 
different languages. i don't think we'll ever see another one like 
warren. he went out with style too, leaving us with easily the best 
album ever by a musician with terminal lung cancer. the documentary of 
the making of the record is also worth picking up. never mind that it's 
a vh1 production, it's one of the best movies i've ever seen about 
living life right up to the very end.

speaking of movies (weren't we?)... i miss steve langley's "regular 
guy" movie reviews. they were clear and concise and very accurate (in 
other words, i usually agreed with him). only once did he truly miss 
the boat, with his comments on "heist". sorry, but that disaster was 
one of the worst squanderings of talent in movie history, with only two 
decent lines and one clever twist balanced against a dozen 
forehead-slappingly inexplicable happenings. (best line isn't "that's 
why they call it `money'!", it's "don't you want to hear my last 
words?" "i just did" &lt;blam!&#62;) fred davis's movie list from a few issues 
back was a fun read. partly because it practically screams out "i was 
written by an old white guy!" and partly because he's got some 
interesting choices that i might have to catch up with sometime. and 
partly because he inspired me to think about what would be on my own 
list. the short list: "wizard of oz", "star wars", "casablanca", "pulp 
fiction", "seven samurai", "city lights", "notorious", "apocalypse 
now", "sunset boulevard" and "all that jazz". the longer (less orderly) 
list can be found on the web in the imdb at 
http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=17353394 - it's 1259 titles long 
and still growing. ah, imdb, no site is more dangerous for the movie 
trivia obsessed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Indeed, I spend a not insignificant amount of time there myself,
and I know I am a light user.
I thought Steve's explanation for stopping the movie reviews was (as usual
for him) completely logical and straightforward.
He was going to the movies to escape from drudgery on his job, and once
he was retired, he found no need to go see the movies.
As I understand it from him, he went from seeing about five movies a week
to pretty close to zero cold turkey.
I've not heard a great deal from him this year though.
Steve, check in with us.... (no guarantee he'll pay attention, but we'll ask)
I just today saw the best movie I've seen this year, deserving of Oscar nomination,
and it's a Will Ferrell movie!
"Stranger than Fiction" sees Will keeping his overacting safely locked up in
his pants.
People like Linda Hunt, Emma Thompson, and Queen Latifah are perfect 
in relatively small roles.
Dustin Hoffman is even better in a slightly larger one, keep your eye on the 
coffee, and on Emma's cigarettes.
Zach Helm is the screenwriter, and (not being on line at the moment) you'll
have to go to the aforementioned imdb to find out what else he's done.
But I've not heard of him before so I think he's a fresh new face worth watching!
This is great high concept without going nuts like so many of the other hot
directors do, so that you feel like you're being artsied to death.
Go with the plot as it develops and you'll be well rewarded.
I won't tell you more, though most of you will probably read reviews that
will tell you a bit more.
I will just ask you though, is anyone hotter just moving around than 
Maggie Gyllenhaal?
No, no, not by a long shot.))</i>

the endless baseball discussions, on the other hand...well...guess i'm 
blown away that anybody pays that close attention to it at the level 
you guys do. even though there are a couple minor league teams within 
easy driving distance of here, they're not exactly household names. 
instead the papers waste endless ink on the angelos-crippled orioles 
and the underdog (and also angelos-crippled) nationals. the nationals 
soap opera (is dc getting a team? are they ever going to sell them to a 
real owner? will they have a stadium? will they have parking garages? 
will it be back to the drawing board?) is so exhausting that i don't 
have any energy left to root for the actual team on the field. i wish 
them the best, though.

mini-tirade on the music industry time. i don't know about you, but i'm 
sick of the riaa and other powers that be whining about how internet 
piracy is killing their business. ummm...no. i don't believe that for a 
minute. either they're not doing their homework or else it's too scary 
to admit the truth. i think it's much more likely a combination of 
factors. first of all, all the old guys like me have finished replacing 
their vinyl with cd's by now. second, there's serious competition for 
entertainment $$$ with dvds and computer games that wasn't there 
before. third, radio isn't very good at breaking new bands anymore 
outside of a few narrow genres (country &amp; rap). maybe that's because 
the music sucks (contrary to public opinion, i don't believe that's 
so), is too crass to listen to for extended periods (definitely), or 
it's just safer to play classic rock (yawn). fourth, it's too expensive 
for what you get. there's no way i'm going to pay a buck a song for a 
heavily restricted download that vanishes at the first disk crash. $15 
for a cd when i can get two great dvds for the same price? i'm gonna 
think twice. fifth, it's a lot easier to get perfectly fine used cds on 
amazon or half.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
when it comes to free downloading (which i might have done a time or 
two), that's ideal for trying out new stuff, what radio used to be good 
for. the quality is too hit-or-miss to replace good ole cds. my feeling 
is that it's a net-positive for the bands, particularly bands that are 
still able to tour. oh well, there are plenty of great free music 
sources on the net these days that are perfectly legal. i've been 
playing around with pandora.com lately. it's an interesting concept, 
playing songs related by "musical genomes".

his administration was clearly taking on water early in the first term. 
their imperial presidency mentality clearly wasn't working with a 
divided congress, and it looked to me like w was gonna be a one-termer 
just like daddy. then 9/11 happened and that changed everything. 
suddenly our smirking frat boy president could jut out his chin, growl 
about how "we're gonna git bin laden, dead or alive" and look like a 
serious leader. the administration shrewdly seized on terror as the 
issue they could ride for every occasion ("don't question the 
president, or the terrorists win!", "pass tax cuts or the terrorists 
win!", "you're not safe voting for the other party or the terrorists 
win!"). it's natural for every president to try and amass as much power 
as possible, that always happens. but the circumstances, and the 
republican-owned house and senate allowed him to get away with it. it's 
impossible to blame everything that has gone wrong on bush, because his 
party leadership has been at least as responsible for the mess we're in 
as he is. i've never gotten the feeling that the republican brass 
particularly know or care what good governing is about. they're more 
interested in grabbing power for its own sake instead of using it 
responsibly. it doesn't appear to have dawned on them that 
bomb-throwing partisanship is only ok when you're not driving the bus. 
now after only four short years of republican domination it looks like 
they are going down hard. another week and we'll know for sure - it'll 
be interesting to see how it all shakes out. maybe the shameless 
republican big lie machine still works the magic, but it looks like the 
magic is wearing off. and this is without any particularly effective 
effort by the democrats - the gop is imploding all on its own. (fyi, 
no, i'm not a democrat and don't particularly care for them either.)
<i>((I nailed my pre-election guess that the Senate would go to 49 
Republicans and that Chafee in my Rhode Island would lose.
And I saw before and say now that this is not because of some wonderful
alternative proposed by Democrats, but more a NOT Bush argument.
Much of what you say I agree with and don't see how it opposes what Mark Lew
and I were saying - just hitting issues from another direction.
But I'll let you or others weigh in before reiterating.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
writing contracts doesn't make the republicans big spenders. their key 
is that they have perfected "borrow and spend" as an unstated 
philosophy while still aggressively slamming the dems for being tax and 
spenders, whether that's true or not. borrowing is painless...for now. 
and "now" is all that matters when the only goal is to be re-elected. 
maybe the debt will matter someday, maybe it won't, and how can that be 
measured anyways? ah, who cares, this current batch of elected 
officials will be dead before that happens. or global warming will have 
killed us all and it won't matter anyways. whatever. put it off til 
tomorrow. get rid of the death tax today or the terrorists win!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
it's true that this administration controls information as tightly as 
any i've ever seen and stays distressingly "on message" even when the 
message is blatantly false. unfortunately saying that something is so 
often enough might work to get you elected, but it doesn't work so well 
as foreign policy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
i got a nice chuckle from the comments implying that the government 
should promote innovation. that's not like any government i've ever 
seen.
<i>((This is the only point I'll break in on a bit.
Would you accept it as dissuading innovation less?
Those are two sides of the same coin.
And if government funds research it directly affects innovation.
You can say government itself does not ever directly promote innovation
but if you say that, I'll vehemently disagree with you.
Innovation tends not to be a very public sexy thing, strangely enough.
But I'll not say more than that clarification and see if the popular
support from the peanut gallery supports you or me.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
basically i'd say that bush has been a failure because he believes that 
he's divinely inspired. he can't admit that he's made a mistake because 
god is never wrong. so whatever the course is, we've got to stick to 
it. right off the cliff, if need be. and the people around him take 
advantage of that, because he just doesn't care about anything outside 
of his narrow focus: holy war against the terrorists and tax cuts for 
the wealthy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
i read recently that bush wants to be like reagan. and i'd say he's 
doing a great job of it. he's just like reagan, only without the charm.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ok, enough ramblings for now. maybe i should do this more than once 
every five years....ok, enough for now! seriously!

Jim-Bob, Pete, BRUX

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(1) Its not officially announced yet, but the team has made a deal for
a new stadium in Fremont. Some locals are bewailing that the team has
moved away, but the real news here is that the As *didnt* leave
Oakland.  Fremont is just 20 miles down the road, so it's no more of a
move than it was for plenty of other teams that relocated to a more
suburban locale.  For those east of the hills, a significant portion of
the fan base, the drive will become easier because it will now be
practical to approach via 680, thus avoiding the worst traffic area,
through the Caldecott Tunnel and near the MacArthur maze.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Fremont solution was inevitable, I think. (And presumably that's
why there really isnt that much fuss about it.) It solves all the
problems. The Coliseum was no longer satisfactory. The City of Oakland
had no interest in cooperating for a new stadium.  Giants territorial
rights prevent the team from moving to San Jose or Silicon Valley,
which is what the owners would have really liked.  By going to Fremont,
they get a cooperative city government, they're still reasonably close
to Oakland, and they've moved a half hour closer to the South Bay
audience (generally considered the best source of potential revenue)
without technically violating SFs territory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(2) Ron Washington was hired manager for the Texas Rangers.  This is
what really has the fan base in an uproar. Seriously. I havent seem
them so excited since Hudson and Mulder were both traded within a week
of each other.  The fans are far more upset about losing Wash than they
are about losing Zito. (Admittedly, the latter news was absorbed
gradually over a year or more.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unless they're pretty hard-core, most baseball fans outside Oakland
probably haven't even heard of Ron Washington. He's been the third-base
coach for 11 years  the longest tenure for any coach or player, come
to think of it, well beloved by the players, and widely credited for
the team's excellent infield defense.
<i>((I was a huge Kansas City Royals fan in high school, and for the 
teams I was a fan of, like the SF Giants, the Royals, and the White Sox,
I even closely followed their minor league teams.  
So I was aware of Ron Washington when he was in the Royals minor league
system in the 1972-75 period. 
I think he was traded to the Twins but he went through some other team,
maybe the Dodgers or Padres, one of the teams that had a Triple A team
in the PCL.
But I remember him as a utility infielder for the Twins in the mid-1980's.
He wasn't an especially brilliant fielder, but I guess he did OK teaching
fielding to the A's.
I did a quick "compare stats" on him (since I think that is an interesting
programmed way of telling what players are like) and among current players
up popped Marco Scutaro!
So to the extent that he "made" Scutaro, I'll bet he is one person
who was campaigning for Washington to get the job.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some, including at least one serious journalist, have suggested that
Beane dragged out his own manager search so that Washington would be
hired by Texas and therefore it wouldnt look so bad when the A's
didn't offer him the job. That idea had been floated in Athletics
Nation weeks before, and I thought it was amusing, but I didnt think
people would be believing it literally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My take is quite different.  I think Washington prefers managing in
Texas to managing in Oakland partly because its closer to home,
<i>((I noted he originally was from New Orleans, so is that what you
mean by "home"?))</i>
partly because it works better for him to make a fresh start with a new
team, and partly because he knows what its like to work for Billy
Beane and would prefer not to.  If both Oakland and Texas offered him a
managers job, I think he would have chosen Texas.  I also think that
Billy was well aware of that. (Wash may well have told him so at the
interview.)  He knows that If Oakland offers Wash the job and Wash says
no - or worse, maybe, but only if I dont get an offer from Texas -
then everybody looks bad.  Whether Billy wants Wash or not, there is
nothing to be gained by offering the job publicly before he finds out
whether Texas is going to make an offer.  *That* is why Oaklands
manager search has been drawn out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now that Wash is out of the way, Billy can decide who he really wants
of the candidates available.  I think itll be Geren, who I think will
actually be pretty good.  The fan base is vociferously against Geren
right now, though. Theyre pretty vocal against Beane at the moment,
too. More than Ive seen since ... well, ever.  Beane's always been
popular.  Right now I'd guess his approval rating among those who know
enough to have an opinion, is somewhere around 50%.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(1) The thing I'm most interested in finding out about Fremont is,  
what on earth will they call the team? It would be insane to continue  
with "Oakland A's". California? San Jose?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Mark Lew replies:</b>
There's been plenty of speculation.  City of Fremont made some official 
comments saying (1) they don't expect "Fremont" to be part of the name, 
and (2) they understand that it will be strictly "a marketing 
decision".  The second one is absolutely right.  They'll name it 
whatever they feel will sell the most.  Keeping the Oakland name isn't 
completely insane. Fremont is arguably an Oakland suburb and plenty of 
cities keep the city name when moving to a suburb.  Putting San Jose in 
the name has a lot of plus marketing but also some minus; unlike 
something more nebulous it reinforces the idea that the team has left 
Oakland and moved to another city (which is also both plus and minus).  
That's particularly true for the nationwide audience.  Some guy in 
Florida has no idea where Fremont is and only a hint of a clue where 
Oakland and San Jose are.  If the A's are still the Oakland A's, he 
thinks, "Oh, they got a new stadium somewhere"; if they become 
something generic like California A's, pretty much the same; but if 
they become the San Jose A's he thinks, "Hey, the A's left Oakland and 
moved to San Jose."  Also, putting San Jose in the name might cause 
Peter McGowan to kick up a fuss, though I don't think he could actually 
block the name change.  Some have suggested "South Bay A's" as a 
compromise, on the theory that it plays nearly as hard for the San Jose 
affection but with less blowback both from McGowan and from Oakland 
fans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(2) I guess I hadn't really thought about whether Washington wanted a  
job offer from Oakland. If he didn't want to work there all along,  
then Beane was an idiot for not making sure the public knew that  
(through off-the-record comments that he could be sure would turn up  
in the media). And if Washington didn't want the Oakland job, why  
were A's players campaigning so hard for him? Weird.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh, I think Washington definitely wanted the job in Oakland.  I'm just 
saying that between Oakland and Texas, Oakland was his second choice.  
He had to figure that Texas wasn't a definite yes (most in Texas are 
saying he was a longshot candidate, with Wakamatsu and Hillman being 
the favorites) and that Oakland wasn't a definite no. He definitely 
wanted to be a manager somewhere, and would happily take either job, 
but if he had the choice between the both of them he'd rather go to 
Texas. (There's a quote from one of the Texas people - the owner, I 
think it was - that suggests that, but only if you read between the 
lines.  Billy of course has revealed nothing about it.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I figure Billy had not definitely decided against Wash, so he surely 
wasn't going to say anything about it before Texas hired him.  Now that 
he is hired, I still don't see there's a great need for Billy to let it 
be known (if indeed it is true) that he knew Texas was Wash's first 
choice.  What exactly is served by such a leak?  To diminish the public 
hostility?  That's going to flare up regardless and it's going to 
simmer down, and it's unlikely to do any real harm.  If it does, he can 
always leak it later.

is more of a baseball traditionalist and less of a stats driven button
pusher than Billy Beane likes, isn't it?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The new conventional wisdom that is (barely) starting to form is that 
Beane's choice now is Trey Hillman, but San Diego might want him too in 
which case we probably won't get him.  A few weeks ago nearly everyone 
thought it was sure to be Geren, but now they don't seem so sure.  Not 
sure what the difference is. Maybe just idle minds starting to wander.  
Fan preference is all over the map.  In a straw poll I don't think any 
one candidate would get 25% support.  Hillman probably would rank 
highest, but there is substantial support for Geren, Black, Hershiser 
and numerous other candidates and non-candidates.  (Though come to 
think of it, I don't think I've seen anyone say we should choose Manny 
Acta.)

OK, I really can't say much about the managerial situation in Oakland, since 
I don't follow the team (or even the sport) that closely.  But I do have an 
opinion on the above.  I don't think it would be at all "insane" for the team to 
keep the name "Oakland A's" if they move to Fremont.  I can think of a number 
of pro sports teams which have retained the name of the main nearby city even 
though they're based in a suburb.  I'd guess strongly that the team WOULD 
keep its current name under those circumstances, although I suppose San Jose and 
Bay Area would both be suitable alternatives.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The suggestion that they might use the name "California" makes me wanna puke, 
though.  First of all, I really dislike it when a team uses a whole state's 
name instead of just a city - that seems unduly greedy to me.  (And given 
that, you can imagine just how much I detest the grossly misnamed "New England 
Patriots"!)  But the situation is exacerbated immeasurably when a team uses a 
state name and the state has another team (with a city name) within its borders.  
Thus, the Florida Marlins really piss me off!  It just sounds so stupid when 
we have games like "Florida at Tampa Bay."  Of course, while I'm railing, I 
should also inveigh against the Grand Award Winner for dumbest team name of all 
time, the "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim."  (And to think I actually almost 
liked this team once upon a time!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Not intended to support nor rebut your argument, but one data point you 
might not be aware of.  Fremont is in fact closer to downtown San Jose 
than to downtown Oakland, though not by much.  Although Fremont is 
arguably a suburb of Oakland, it's just as plausibly a suburb of San 
Jose.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Regarding Bruce's comment about the Angels...))</i>
I assume you know the logic for this, right?  The team wants to be 
called "Los Angeles" because their marketing has determined where the 
best money.  At the same time, the team is contractually obligated to 
have "Anaheim" in its name.  The contract doesn't specify that 
"Anaheim" has to be at the front end of the name.  Basically, they want 
to be called "Los Angeles Angels" and that other part is stuck on there 
because they're required to.

In fact, I'd bet if you asked a sampling of the general public
nationwide, they'd tell you that Oakland is bigger than San Jose.  This
misimpression would be due in large part (actually, entirely) to 
Oakland's prominent
place in the history of American professional sports.

I'll agree with "in large part" but not "entirely".  I think some of it 
comes from history generally.  Oakland was larger than San Jose for 
most of its history.  Until recently, San Francisco - Oakland was 
comparable to Minneapolis - St Paul.

Fundamentally, my problem with an "Oakland A's" team in Fremont is  
just a personal one: I see Oakland as being a minor city, making it  
weird to keep their name when the team is in another minor city. It  
would be like having a stadium in Clearwater and calling the team the  
"St. Petersburg Rays" when Tampa is the only city of significance.

"Only city of significance".  Surely overstates the case.  Tampa isn't 
that much bigger than St Pete.  I'm not into Oakland pride nearly as 
much as others in the city, but if someone were to say San Francisco is 
the "only city of significance" in the Bay Area, I would surely object 
to that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think there's some truth in saying that the conceptual geography 
represented by the A's is Bay-Area-that's-not-San-Francisco.  Oakland 
was once the figurehead of that anti-region.  Now it's San Jose.  By 
that logic the team ought to become the San Jose A's.  That idea might 
be resisted by (1) Oaklanders who don't want to let go of the title of 
most prominent non-SF city in the Bay Area, and (2) San Francisco 
interests who prefer the team not attract greater not-SF following.

<i>((OK, I thought I had responded to this... but it turned out
I hadn't.
So... my E-Mail was lost, this is an attempt to recreate it.
First, I would like to guess what the sizes of these cities all are:
San Francisco the largest ranked about 15th, San Jose next about 20th,
Oakland next around 50th, then Tampa around 70th, St.Pete way back
around 90th, and Fremont bringing up the rear around 100th.
I went to the Information Please web site for the answers and their rankings
listed as estimated in mid-2005 (infoplease.com).
I am probably more knowledgeable than the average person, but I hadn't
been studying the rankings recently.
Working up from the bottom, I nailed Fremont pretty closely, it is ranked
at 96th with about 200,000 people, one COULD name a team after Fremont, but
that's pretty small as cities for naming sports teams go.
Green Bay of course tops (or bottoms, depending on your point of view)
that list with just barely over 100,000 people and a
ranking of 233.
But they have "history".
St. Pete is 69th, larger than I thought, but still considerably smaller for
a comparison at about 250,000, and Tampa is 58th with a little over 300,000 people.
Oakland is also a little larger than I thought though, at 42nd with about
400,000 people.
Then I lose my ranking as San Jose is now bigger than San Francisco (you all
probably knew this, but I didn't).
San Jose has almost 900,000 people and is 10th, I hadn't realized they cracked
the top 10, since they're still growing so fast, they probably nearly have a
million by now!!!
San Francisco is about as large as I thought, though, with 14th place and
almost 750,000.
I just heard the 49ers are thinking about building a new stadium a bit "south"
too.
This is not surprising.
The tenth largest city with only the Sharks in Hockey as a major sports franchise?
San Antonio is the comparable city then as it is 7th and doesn't have too many
sports teams either and then has Houston not far away.
But here, the key is that San Jose is actually BIGGER than either one
of its team owning neighbors.
So of course it is a magnet to getting teams to move their stadiums south toward
San Jose.
It's pretty much a no-brainer.
So, go for it, A's!
Good move.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Big East Basketball Preview Comments</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I believe that the Big East is in for a great entertaining season.  While
there are the usual "tiers of talent" there are no clearly dominant teams.
The league lost 18 of the 21 players that were on the BE first or second
teams last season.  In the top tier are UCONN, Pitt, G'town, Marquette, and
SU.  At the bottom are WVA, Cincinnati, Rutgers, Seton Hall, and South
Florida with everyone else falling in between.
<i>((I think that Notre Dame is going to fall and one of the lower teams
like Cinci/Rutgers is going to surprise a bit. 
Marquis Webb for Rutgers, in particular, is now a senior and this should
be his best season.
Cinci will surprise if newcomer Deonta Vaughn matures really quickly.
Choose your poison on what you think will spark a surprise. 
And UConn is going to have a tough season, especially early, I think.
Calhoun is certainly whining enough about it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My team, SU, will live and die on the senior play of Nichols, Watkins, and
Roberts.  All have played great and times and all have all disappeared for
long stretches of previous seasons.  Forgive me SU fans and Coach B, but as
much as I loved Gmac, he was overrated as a player, but not as a leader.
His points will be made up by star frosh Harris and sophomore Devendorf.
Harris is built like a tank, but is certainly not the next 'Melo.  He out
muscled opponents in high school which won't be as easy in Div 1 and also
has a limited jump shooting ability.
<i>((My brother David will debate SU basketball with you, I respect 'em,
but don't like 'em, especially your current big three seniors.  We'll see
how they do now that they have to lead on their own.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The biggest changes in the league will be the moving up of DePaul and
possibly St John's and the drop of WVA and Notre Dame.  WVA will be awful
after basically losing the entire team to graduation.  However, my favorite
team to hate, Notre Dame, may struggle to make even the Big East Tournament
with the loss of Francis and Quinn and a mediocre incoming class.  Watch for
Brey to get the axe at the end of the season.  Cincinnati will also drop
into the bottom of the league this year.
<i>((Well, gee for a ND hater, I think you're overestimating them a bit.
They could have a TRULY bad year.
Colin Falls is way overrated in my view, and they need Tory Jackson to step
up as a rookie...
now for our local team, Providence.
They're going to sneak up on people this year, and I think they have a shot
at the NCAA's, though agreed that is a stretch.
I think the biggest issue for them is that people see that Randall Hanke may
not be back for this season, probably redshirted and then think PC has
no inside presence.
Frosh Ray Hall is going to get a chance to play and he's going to make one
of the Frosh teams by the end of the year.
He's a 7 foot, 280 pound bruiser type, he comes from Colorado and was off
the Eastern basketball radar screens, I think.
Also, if you saw Geoff McDermott last year, he was injured all year, and you're
going to see a different player this year and he's going to AVERAGE a double-double.
And if he does that I guarantee it will be noticed.
Sharaud Curry is going to be one of the top five Big East point guards.
So why do none of these guys get any credit, none of them are on ANY pre-season
Big East teams by anyone?
I'm not really sure.
But I honestly think PC could end up as high as 6th, and NO lower than 12th in
the league and most people are predicting them lower than that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I hate the everyone doesn't play everyone else in the league at least once,
but that will be getting better soon.  It doesn't bother me that some teams
don't make it to MSG at the end of the season.  It adds another race to the
end of the season.  Of course, that is coming from an SU fan who doesn't
ever have to sweat that out.

Of course, there, since I nailed Florida last year and they have everyone

(STAR TREK PRESS - SISKO'S LOG): We are under attack by an alien group of lizard/humanoid
hybrids called the Gorn, and they are attacking us along with an unknown alien group.
(Sisko is interrupted by Jadzia Dax as he thinks to himself how nice it is that she
is alive in this reality.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Dax)(D) I have analyzed some of the strange protomatter signatures from subspace.
We are not the only beings suddenly placed into this reality from other realities.
The Gorn are apparently involved in a uneasy truce with the Federation in a reality
and in that same reality there are intelligent Tribbles who were Federation allies
before they attacked the Federation in that same reality.
They got wiped out by the Gorn.
The Tribbles are here too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Sisko)(S) Yipee!

called "Game Press".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(S) Game Press?
And you're saying that Q put it there?
But why?
Just to amuse his warped sense of reality by watching us struggle through
one reality to the next like a child torturing a bug!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(D) Pretty much.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(S) Who is QII?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(D) A member of the Continuum who has lowered himself to our insect-like
existence and apparently is an ally of the Gorn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(S) You know, I actually talked to him on the com-pic, but I did not
want to go to war with the Gorn without provocation.
I didn't know he was a Q.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(D) QII.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(S) Whatever.
I wonder if my dad has a recipe for baked lizard meat?

the Gorn eat...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MALICE IN CENTERLAND - PART 1:  IMPRACTICAL DEMON KEEPING):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One day when he was six a boy we shall call Malice went with 
his family to the beach resort of La Ciotat, a quaint town 
near Malar Beach on Cape Croisette, a tiny protusion of land 
jutting into the Gulf of Lyon southeast of Marseilles, in France.  
It was the beginning of a sweltering August when the French take 
that six-week hiatus they call a vacation but which over-worked 
Americans and other overly zealous capitalists jealously call degenerate sloth.  
(And if you are wondering, Gentle Reader, why this story starts in France, 
it's because I am the writer and you are the Gentle Reader... thats why.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Under the watchful eye of his mother, Malice explored many things 
in La Ciotat that summer: the grounds of the farm where his family stayed; 
the tiny shops that were busy now but would struggle during the off-season 
when the tourist flow trickled to nothing;  the breaks and folds of Malar Beach; 
and the inconsequential woods near at hand.  She was a good mother.  
Yet, even so, she was not everywhere all the time and so couldn't 
note the very curious discovery Malice made one afternoon as he 
explored a not-so-famous cave at the foot of the narrow sea cliffs 
between the beach and the woods.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some twenty centuries or so before the founding of La Ciotat, 
a Carthaginian galley overburdened with cargo for Hannibals war with Rome 
was caught by a storm, tragically too far from the safety of the jut 
of land that would one day be named Cape Croisette.  
The storm was an unseasonably wicked storm.  A horridly powerful storm.  
Some said a demonically inspired storm.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Her crew, of course, fought desperately to save her, but the Nellie 
sank beneath the relentless oceanic onslaught with lethal consequence 
for all hands.  For many days after detritus from the wreck was strewn 
ashore along the coast and was cautiously, methodically, and nearly 
completely, scavenged by local fishers, hunters, and tribesmen.  
Pilgrims, wanderers, and deserters from the army would occasionally 
find additional remnants of the Nellie for months thereafter.  
But one item - a globe of solid crystal - was not seen by human eyes 
again until that sweltering August day when Malice tugged it free 
from the rocks in the cave and placed it in the beach duffle he'd 
filled with worn shells, smoothed stones, and bits of curiously shaped driftwood.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As legend would have it across the centuries, the galley and her crew 
had not so much been caught by a freak summer storm as doomed by dark magic.  
This conjured doom, omened in the dark auguries of a Carthaginian 
necromancer, was a consequence of the presence aboard the Nellie 
of the Diplonomicon.  It was whispered that the Diplonomicon, 
an artifact of arcane and catastrophic wild magic, had been crafted 
in the molten magma of the volcanic heart rock of the Island of Malta.  
The tortured souls who had swallowed many lives to force powerful magic 
into the degenerate artifact called it the "Maltese Dipcon."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
From earliest history, the artifact had presented itself as a 
rectangularly-shaped shallow stone box constructed in two parts; 
a flattened lid with a grooved edge that snugly fit into a slightly 
deeper bottom piece to create a shallow compartment.  
The lid's center was inlaid with a rune of black stone.  
Though polished, the stone neither caught nor reflected light.  
A modest tablet crafted from a light, fine-grained wood rested snugly 
in the compartment.  The surface of the tablet was inscribed with 
lines and scripts suggestive of a map, while seven glyphs outlined 
the tablets edge at irregular intervals.  Like the lid, the tablet 
was inlaid with black stones, only these were shaped as small circles, 
thirty-five by count.  
<i>((I really hesitate to interrupt this spellbinding tale, but 
should not that be thirty-four, rather than thirty-five black stones???
Perhaps we will learn more as the tale develops.))</i>
At each end of the tablet were sectioned 
compartments holding cut and polished stones of seven different colors.  
The stones were all generally rectangular in shape, but while some 
were short and squat, others were long and thin.  One hundred and 
twelve in all, the stones manifested both the upright and inverted 
energies of each of the 56 cards of the Minor Arcana of the 
ensorcelled Tarot from whence they derived their immense latent power.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Forged with horrific, pitiless, and venomous rites, the Maltese 
Dipcon was a tool of hegemony and war, a magical and hideous relic 
of bloodshed and mastery over peoples and nations.  The star-crossed 
Nellies orders had been to transport the artifact to Carthage's 
great general in a final, extreme act of defiance and conquest.  
Faced with ruin before the treachery and legions of an empire-bent Rome, 
Hannibal had been ordered to defy ancient prophecy and invoke the 
necromancy of the Diplonomicon to alter the fate of Carthage and her empire.  
The Grand Magus of Malta would arrive with the Dipcon in Hannibal's camp 
in the hills south of fledgling Roma.  It was said he alone knew the 
baleful, secret Rites of Summoning.  To invoke both the supernatural and 
demonic, he would carefully pick out 22 stones, one for each manifestation 
of the tarot's Major Arcana.  He would carefully select 22 stones to ensure 
that their correct colors and shapes and placement on the tablet 
would properly invocate the desired dark magic.  He would utter 
cabalistic mutterings and unleash catastrophic forces of desperation 
and conquest against the soldiers of Rome.  
Hannibal's army would march west, destroy that city, enslave her people, 
and sow her fertile fields with salt.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Or so went the plan.  With the sinking of the Nellie and the 
Maltese Dipcon sank the ultimate fortunes of Hannibal, his army, 
his beloved Carthage, and a mighty civilization.  Years later, 
the Diplonomicon a bitter curse on his lips, he would take his 
own life in a tiny unnamed Turkish village before Roman assassins 
could end his life as entire legions had not.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Young Malice knew none of this of course or he surely would not have 
let three more summers pass before again opening the discarded beach duffle.  
Such is the way with boys - without a thought today's found treasures 
are tomorrow's forgotten junk.  The duffle remained for many months 
forgotten in a dusty corner of the garage behind the house in which 
Malice and his family lived.  After one better than average 
cleaning of the garage, however, Malice rediscovered the duffle bag 
of beach treasures from La Ciotat.  Quite by accident, he pulled 
from the bag the curious crystal globe.  In the dim light of the 
unlit garage Malice could see next to nothing so, with the globe, 
he walked out into the bright daylight.  
Where the crystal globe quite immediately and mysteriously split in half.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, not quite.  That is the version of the story Malice would tell 
years later when asked to repeat the odd beginning of a much odder 
story with quite the oddest ending.  In fact, in the sunlight 
Malice saw that encased at the center of the crystal globe was a tiny figure.  
Squinting closely, he could see that the figure was brownish-green 
of color and possessed of tiny horns and equally tiny batlike wings.  
Like any nine year old, he was surprised and excited at such a find, 
but less surprised than he was a scant moment later when the 
demon opened its eyes and shook its head.  With a startled gasp, 
Malice dropped the globe to the ground where it split neatly in two, 
disgorging the tiny occupant.  
The demon jumped up and scurried for the shadows of the garage.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now young boys may startle at the sight of fast-moving small things, 
but they seldom fear them.  Without a thought Malice scooped at the 
demon with his left hand, then his right, and a moment later 
the demon was wriggling in his closed fist.  
With insight beyond his years Malice thought glass the most appropriate 
container for the struggling prisoner.  
He found a small canning jar in the garage and, without incident, 
dropped the demon into the jar and capped it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You or I might find such a thing as capturing a demon perplexing 
but Malice was quite sanguine and sure of what to do next.  
First, he spoke to no one of the captive.  Keeping a demon was 
nothing like keeping a lizard or lightning bug.  Adults would take 
a demon away as a dangerous and unduly bad influence and 
this he did not want.  Second, he thought the demon would need air.  
(He was wrong in this.)  He poked a few holes through the jar's lid.  
The demon would need food, Malice thought.  At first he added grass 
and dead bugs to the jar but, when after several days the demon hadn't 
eaten, he progressed to small bits of vegetables and live bugs.  
Over the days and weeks and months and years ahead he found that the demon 
would eat most normal food but preferred crusty oatmeal and bits of stale croissant.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With steady feeding the demon grew.  Over time it outgrew the canning 
jar and Malice found a larger jar.  And then a larger jar.  
And then a still larger jar still.  The years passed this way 
until the day arrived when there were no larger jars to be had.  
Malice was seventeen that year and had taken to keeping the demon 
in the cellar of the dilapidated work shed at the far end of the 
property he and his parents lived on just outside the town of Provedance.  
Malice eyed the demon one day, wondering not for the first time 
if demon-keeping wasn't an unusual, if not outright dangerous, practice.  
He pondered getting a large aquarium but knew this would ultimately 
only delay answering the inevitable question of what to do with 
a fully grown demon of indeterminate - but potentially enormous - 
cataclysmic power.  As Malice watched that day, the demon used 
the claws of one hand to clean the claws of the other.  
This was not unusual.  Malice had noted over the years 
that the demon was quite meticulous and conscientious in its grooming.  
In spite of its ever-increasing size and possibly unearthly powers of Hell, 
the demon had been a quite decent companion (he couldnt bring himself to 
say 'pet') through the years.  This penchant for growing, though, 
had called the question at last and Malice was finally perplexed 
to the point of uttering aloud the problem troubling his mind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Mon Dieu, but what am I to do with you?"  This innocent question 
was quietly answered from a most sinister and odd source.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, you might decide to release me from this bloody jar," said the demon, 
looking up from its claws to Malice.  The source was sinister because it was, 
well, after all was said and done, a demon.  A real one.  
The source was odd for the simple reason that, up to this point, neither 
had ever spoken to the other before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Damn!  I... I didnt know you could talk."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Likewise, I'm sure," answered the demon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youve never said a word until now?  Merde, it's been years."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Eleven, give or take.  What's to say?  We are captor and captive, 
you and I.  Roles seemed pretty clear to me."  
Malice considered this and decided the demon was right.  Still.  
And he wasnt sure why the demon was swearing in French at this point, 
though your writer is, Gentle Reader.  Merde is French for shit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So," said Malice, &#228;re you a real demon?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hey - you got me there.  What's the giveaway?  The horns?  Wings?  
Maybe this amulet around my neck - what?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You don't have to be a smartass.  What's your name?  You do have a name?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Demon."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That's your name?  Demon?  Just Demon?  Thats dumb.  I'm Malice."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Don," said Demon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Huh?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I said `Don.'  I was known as `Monde'.  Monde is French for `world.'  
In my case it was an anagram for Demon.  No one got it though, 
so now its just `Don.'  That name is good enough for now.  
If you drop the E and M from Demon you get Don.  
The EM stands for `earthly manifestation,' which is how you see me now.  
While I'm at it, I should tell you this is only how I look to you 
and isnt my true form."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What's your true form?" asked Malice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Open this jar and I'll show you," said Don.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Don't think so, Don.  Whatever you look like, 
you're still a demon.  How do I know what you'll do?  
Impractical as it is, I've been keeping you for a very 
long time and you might be out for a little revenge."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That might all be true, Malice... except for one little thing."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"And whats that, Don?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It is I who have been keeping you.  Now open this jar."

(STAR TREK PRESS - CAPTAIN'S LOG): "UG!"
The Romulans have mounted a successful counteroffensive and have taken, at
least temporarily, our Andorian ally's home world.
What's worse, they unexpectedly sent a Bird of Prey into the Federation
Neutral Zone to defend its forces occupying Deep Space 2.
They can hold it.
I have to attack it to make them use their resources, but we can't take it.
On top of that, the Romulan troop transport that we had surrounded by two
Federation and one Andorian transport has escaped unharmed.
Up until this moment, we were unaware of the Romulans having cloaks on 
transports.
I was wrong.
I salute the Romulans, this time, the war goes on.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The GA-GA draw is defeated yet again, and the GA-GA sallies forth again.
If you have finally become GA-GA over this game, vote yes to this with your Summer
orders.
If you fail to vote, as usual, you veto the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) For the Summer deadline, if everyone submits orders, no reason to wait.
The outcome of this depends on a very simple small set of unit moves.
So, if you know what you want to do, and submit them, I'll adjudicate them.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Last time, we had 
proposed the new TREe and the beGREFT draws.
If you thought the game is up the TREe or you are so beGREFT that you
cannot continue, you would have voted for one of these draws.
Neither of them passed.
We have a new proposal for a concession to Turkey.
If you want to concede to Turkey, please vote with your Summer orders,
since there isn't much action there, I'll probably keep taking votes on
this through Fall.
Doug's army will retreat by default to Belgium.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMAN HOME CENTERS IN EXILE IN BULGARIA to 10 DOWNING STREET, LONDON):  
Are you brave enough to try to cut France out and get the proposed 
three-way?  That path would get you defeated if R/T stay together.  And 
if T stabs R, it lets you off that hook, but Turkey will be at 17 or 18 
counting my centers.
