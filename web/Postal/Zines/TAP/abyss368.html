<br /><br />This issue we have a number of tributes to long time hobby members Terry Tallman and Dwayne Shreve, 
both of whom passed away in the last year (but we didn't find out until recently).
I printed the tributes and comments I had, follow-ups next issue are welcome.
This is one of the issues where you REALLY want to look at the PDF!
Now I'm looking forward to running a Diplomacy tournament at TotalCon
in Mansfield, MA February 19-21. 
Y'all should come!!!
The new Kendo Nagasaki game keeps going, I like running them and
I also like playing in them... mostly.  Plenty of time to join still.
I also held this up a bit to get the new game starts together.
Thanks for your patience!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That all should keep the szine cranking and I'd like to start another regular
Diplomacy game in addition to the Breaking Away that's getting close to six!
Wishing all the rest of you who are struggling with 
health issues similar good news!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i> in
<i>NSWG</i> #16, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  
Since Terry's passing, we lose our thirty year fervent hope that someday <i>NSWG</i>
would have been resurrected and I could go back and swear my fealty to the Toadfather.
The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
The address is still:
http://diplom.org/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the new list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, we'll see if that helps.
Please let me know.

<i>((For upcoming cons around the world: http://www.diplom.org/Face/cons/index.php, 
success, we have badgered all the Con directors to post their Cons, so it is reasonably
up to date now.
And there remains lots of interest in the FTF community, and linking E-Mail/Web players
to FTF.  
Note especially all the efforts Tom Haver is up to this year!!!  And take special note
of Don Greenwood's note with the World Boardgaming Championships announcement!!!
Now is the time I'm ramping up the slight deviation adjustment in running my February 
Diplomacy tournament, leadoff to the Nor'Easter.
Since TempleCon moved itself to August, great for them horrible for me, I've cut the tie
of... what ten years running Diplomacy there?
Robert Rousse and others had been hoping for some time that I'd move over to TotalCon, 
which actually has WAY more boardgamers and is a bit later in February, this year
February 19-21, just up the road in Mansfield, MA, halfway between Providence and 
Boston.  This also is a plus for our Boston gamers and for the Vermonters coming down
it's closer too.  You might still prefer to fly into Providence's airport, but as noted
it's equidistant between there and Logan Airport in Boston.
We can work out pickups and such.
I also have two hotel rooms reserved down the street at the Red Roof Inn, that are
pay what you want/can, as usual,
http://www.totalcon.com has more particulars.
Pre-convention group rates are available if you send me money or PROMISE me money by
February 10th!  
That will be</i> $<i>50 for badge and full event registration, and I need commitment by <b>February 10th</b>!
Contact me for more details if you're coming.
Be the first to greet me as I prepare to go off the chemotherapy!!!
I know I'm celebrating getting to do this again, come join me!!!
Also, the Facebook page for European Tournament Diplomacy, https://www.facebook.com/groups/1500292310187264/,
Diplomacy in Europe, has been really active and the place to be in the hobby these days.

<b>Eric Ozog (Mon, Jan 18, 2016 at 4:34 AM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following was written by Dwayne Shreve, published in the November 1981 issue of my budding 
dipzine at the time, <i>Diplomacy By Moonlight</i> (DBM).  
These are Dwayne's impressions of the Midwest Diplomacy mini-con that was held at the 
Best Western St. Louis Airport Motel, October 24-25, 1981. 
This event whetted the appetite of bigger "Cons" to come in future years.  
The motel was rather run-down (this "more affordable" venue was 
picked out by Gary Coughlan), but this didn't matter as what was most important was getting together 
to play The Game face-to-face!  We filled two boards with 14 players, playing 4 games on Saturday 
and 2 on Sunday.  At the Con were the Chicago contingent, including Dwayne Shreve, Peter Ashley, 
Bob Osuch, Andy Lischett, and Eric Ozog, Gary Coughlan from Memphis, Bob Kluge  of St. Louis, 
Paul Rauterberg and  Mike Grimm (Milwaukee), Jim Williams (Des Moines, IA), 
Scott Hanson (Minneapolis), Guy and Liz Hail (Austin, TX), and John Michalski (Oklahoma City). 
Here is Dwayne:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It was an interesting trip down to St. Louis. Aside from a delay while we shoveled Osuch 
out of bed, all went smoothly for the four of us.
On our arrival, our first order of business was to locate a liquor store. 
After a long and tearful search we found one. Shortly, we walked out of there with a new lease on life, 
Osuch with some vodka, Ashley with some beer, Ozog empty handed and myself with some wine. 
No doubt the reader is wondering why we keep Ozog around. I used to wonder that myself, 
until one day I figured it out. He is around so that every time anyone says that 
Chicago Diplomacy players are all a bunch of drunken and drug-crazed lunatics, we can trot him out. 
This of course merely proves that we are not all drunken and drug-crazed, but it is better 
than no response at all."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"In any event, we gathered with 11 or so other Diplomacy players at a motel which was the 
only one along that stretch without hourly rates.  To Eric, that meant it was a good place. 
It was a remarkable motel, no doubt. The water in the pool, for example, would have been 
strangely reminiscent of the Chicago River, except that it was much greener.
At any rate we were soon working on Diplomacy games. In another room, Ozog was being 
crafty and cunning and somehow got in on a seven way draw. Meanwhile, I screwed up and 
only got a two way French/Italian draw.
Later in another game, I was viciously stabbed by my Austrian ally. 
With my Italian centers falling all around me, I yelled defiance against her 
[Liz Hall] and her Turkish overlord, Michalski. Every last unit strained for vengeance. 
Every move was geared for retribution, as I and the Russian tore into her. 
Finally, seeing that I could not take her last SC and sensing an impatience with my 
continuing two SC vendetta, I decided to finally vote for a three way draw, 
which of course included neither of us."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The next morning it was decided to play gunboat Diplomacy. 
Unfortunately our numbers had dwindled somewhat, so that in playing 
two simultaneous games, three would have to have concurrent countries. 
As fate would have it, I ended up in both games, as Germany in one and Austria in the other. 
I was appalled. I don’t like playing Austria anytime and even less so when there 
is no discussion. I decided I wanted to pay more attention to Germany and 
perhaps be more daring with Austria, and try for survival there.
I managed to get my Germany into a three way draw and despite having 
Ozog as Italy battled my Austria into a second place finish. 
I still have nightmares where I have Austria and can’t talk to anyone 
and have an Ozogian Italy foaming at the mouth at my back."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Another part of the weekend was the chance to get together with people throughout 
the heartland of America and trade insults of John Boardman. My favorite was, 
`Even if Boardman managed to double the size of his brain, it still wouldn't plug a rat’s ass.'
All in all, it was a great weekend. I discovered that Michalski is an all right 
fellow even if a bit too moderate. We all learned that Bob Osuch is a man of many talents, 
not the least of which is an ability to sleep under sinks, after consuming impressive amounts of vodka. 
Essentially though, I enjoyed getting together with my fellow hell-raisers and play Diplomacy face to face."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Eric Ozog here.  It was so cold in the motel room that night. Four of us shared one room: 
Peter, Bob, Dwayne and myself.  I had volunteered to take the floor, which was a big mistake, 
as there was no alcohol in me, nor any bedding-just the coat on my back. 
I froze my butt off and hardly got any sleep (the heater was turned all the way up, 
but as it was installed near the ceiling of the room the heat never reached the floor). 
I wrote in DBM about my miserable night, and about how Dwayne passed on an opportunity 
to save me (excerpt):
"I woke at 7:30, actually 6:30 for we gained an hour that night 
(but big deal, it did me no good). I saw that since I suffered, everyone else had to suffer too. 
Dwayne complained and said how he heard someone cry out during the night, `I’m cooooold!' and 
how he thought it was God at first talking to him, but soon decided that it was only Eric and he was freezing. 
Dwayne said he debated whether or not to sacrifice his blanket and throw it on top of me, 
but his survival instinct won the argument and concluded, `Hell No!' "

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still had a great time at my first Con, despite that crummy hotel room. 
After all it’s the people that mattered most, the camaraderie with my new-found Diplomacy friends, 
including Dwayne. Rest in peace!

<i>((Yes, we will miss Dwayne's quick wit and dynamic play.  He played Germany in Fantastic Voyage, 1999K,
back in the day here.  What a lineup that game had?  Paul Rauterberg as Austria, John Biehl as England, 
Rick Davis as France, Terry Tallman as Italy, Buddy Tretick as Russia (Buddy doing his comeback under his
own name), and Randy Ellis as Turkey.  I think this was Dwayne's last Diplomacy game as he retired in game year
1908, in the summer of 2002.  Here was his final retirement statement: "I greatly overestimated my post-retirement
enthusiasm for a return to Diplomacy and the imagined vista of a lot of time to spend as well. 
One would think that by now, I would have outgrown my tendency to hyperactivity, but retirement at 52 freed me 
up to do a lot of things that I had to put off when I was working. I have also taken on new skills and interests, 
such as web site development, biking and hiking, so there are more things drawing my attention, 
in addition to the other hobbies I have had all along, such as gardening, fishing, reading and well-researched travel. 
I believe that I will return to Dip at some point in the future; if I ever wind up in a nursing home, 
you can even bank on it. I don't much care for the lying that one comes across, but I do enjoy strategies 
when I have time to plan them. As it was, I was not doing a good job as Germany, but I managed to leave 
the game while also leaving my allies in a better state than they might have been. I wish Buddy and John
the best and the other players as well."
As far as I know he never did come back, RIP Dwayne!!!
Shifting to Eric Ozog and Larry Peery on Terry Tallman's passing, I want to stick in here (only in the
PDF version of the szine, some copies of old material from the original <b>North Sealth West George</b>, first 
up is Eric noting what Bob Olsen had to say about <b>NSWG</b> 5...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Something else you might like to print - a note from Bob Olsen (published in <i>DBM</i>, March '83) 
commenting on Terry's NSWG zine cover:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That's a remarkable likeness of you on the cover of <i>NSWG</i> this month. 
This guy is a true artist; it's like you're about to step off the page and strangle me. 
And his pic of Caruso is perhaps even better. It's like Caruso is about to step off the page and give me a big kiss! 
Hahahaha! Do you realize, I'm the one who's fastened the "wimp" label on John? 
All part of a plot to hold him in place till FBI agents can surround the house, you never know what these mafia 
types have stored away in the basement after all. I've designated Caruso as "Hobby Criminal Element." "

<br /><br /><b>Continuing Larry Peery (Tue, Jan 19, 2016 at 3:21 PM</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((The first page of Larry's commentary comes in the last page of the PDF insert, and then continues here...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Terry Tallman had his clique, his claque, his fans, and his critics. I confess I was among the last group.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In those days I considered Terry to be the West Coast equivalent of New York's Robert Sacks, a name only real 
hobby Old Farts will remember. None of us will forget either of them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Or perhaps Terry was Diplomacy’s equivalent to California’s Charles Manson (if you remember back that far 
( to 1969) - not that Terry was a murderer, he was just a bit weird with a facial hair-style to go with it);
and I see no reason to change that opinion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I mostly knew Terry from his `zine <i>North Sealth, West George</i> postal Dip `zine, it's 
unique land-written penmanship and because of its cliquishness -  alas, much of its content and wit were lost on me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Still, when an opportunity arose in the mid-1980s to meet Terry and some of the other members of his clique 
(or claque, clan,  tribe or extended family) (Host Steve and Hostess Daf Langley, P. J. Gaughan,  
Duck Williams, etc.) I jumped on it. I was mesmerized by the possibility of meeting one of the hobby's most  
charismatic and intriguing people (Terry); not to mention some of the luminaries of the hobby of the day. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here again, I think back to the 1977 movie <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> 
(Can you hear those five notes running through your mind, even now?) 
<i>((Of course I can, some of the most memorable note sequences ever...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was drawn by a force, no doubt generated by Terry, to go. I was the Richard Dreyfuss character in 
the movie (Can you name him?) and  I was truly a man on a mission - to be there!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The event, forever after known as DAF CON III, ran from New Year’s Eve Eve... (12/30/83 –- 1/2/84)...
until the second day of the new year, making it one of the rare four-day housecons in Diplomacy history. 
It was held at Steve and Daf's place in Sacramento, California; about mid-way between San Diego and Seattle. 
I Worked until 1800 on New Year’s Eve, the busiest time of the year for us, walked out to the parking lot 
(much to the outrage of my boss), climbed into Mike Maston's new Toyota Celica and away we went. 
It was truly the First Real Dip Grand Prix!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mike was from Sac and knew the area well, or so he said. I hadn't been in Sac since 
Edmund G. Brown was Governor (1959 – 1967) (probably toward the end of that time period)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Route, weather, time...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are <b>473.09</b> direct miles from <b>Sacramento</b> to <b>San Diego</b> and <b>504.47</b> miles by car. 
I figured a tank of gas each way would get us there and back. 
Sacramento and San Diego were <b>7 hours 37 mins</b> far apart (by car) if driving conditions were good. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the best Sacramento, CA - San Diego, CA route (http://www.howtogetfrom.com/route-from-sacramento-ca-to-san-diego-ca). 
The recently completed I-5 interstate made the trip shorter and faster than the old state highway 99 route, 
but it was a lot more boring. The new route was an endless string of chain-operated hotels and 
gas stations located at convenient off-ramps all along the way. 
The old route was an equally endless string of ma and pa run motels and gas stations; 
which might or might not be adjacent to the highway; interrupted by occasional tourist attractions 
such as US Air Force bases (missiles, bombers, fighters, spy planes, they had them all) and 
California prisons (high security to low security, mental facilities, women's facilities, they had them all. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We had planned a series of 65, 80, 100, and 120 mph trip segments that would, with luck,  
get us to Daf's place in 6 hours so we could arrive by midnight. Our Plan B allowed  
8 hours to arrive by 020. It actually took us until 0700 or 13 hours, although Gary said we did it in 10!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We'd forgotten about the fog factor going up the valley,  the infamous Toole fog which often 
covered the Sacramento River delta at that time of year. It was so thick that it could 
reduce traffic speeds to 10-15 mph for the last hundred miles of the trip.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I will never forget tailgating a semi in dense fog at speeds of 10 to 100 mph for 
several hundred miles as we began to get close to Sacramento. 
The truck driver seemed to know the way and how fast he could drive in the fog  
so we just got in his tail wind and followed his barely visible tail lights up the 99. 
When he got off the highway for fuel for his truck or coffee for himself we 
followed like a lost pup; which is exactly what we were. 
We even bought him coffee several times and he said he made that trip two or three times 
a week during the fog season and had been doing it for over 20 years. 
Amazing, how we take the interstate and commercial truck drivers for granted; but they are what keeps America moving.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The changes in freeways and highways, roads, signs and the new bedroom communities and suburbs  
around Sacramento surprised both Mike and I and we would have ended up in Reno, Nevada 
if we'd followed the signs along the I-5, 99, I-50, ETC.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wherever we were going we missed our exit because of fog, road changes and sign changes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Big Let Down Arrival came at 0700. It was still foggy. We were exhausted, etc. but we’d made it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots of cars in front, a house front door ajar, nobody responded to our knocks or "hellos..." 
Everybody was sound asleep, passed out drunk, stoned or...
We wandered through rooms filled with bodies lying on any flat surface big enough to hold them, 
empty pizza boxes and beer bottles abounded. It was quite a welcome to DAF III. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We finally found some life in a back room or garage that contained Terry holding court 
to a few of his bleary-eyed fans and one or two others playing some board game I'd never seen before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After a few hours of waiting around and trying to get people to wake up, etc. we finally 
unwound enough to fall asleep ourselves just as people began to awake.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It wasn't the greatest "first encounter" I've had at a DipCon to say the least.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As I remember; and don't accept this as gospel until after you’ve read some of 
the other Daf Con III reports. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The early conversations were mostly totally unmemorable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Great Tallman-Peery Explosion (Terry and I had had a `zine to `zine "hate-hate relationship" 
pretty much since I rejoined the hobby some time before.) that many were waiting for never happened. 
Either we were on our best behavior or too tired to trade much but verbal jabs. 
Perhaps we were too much alike or too different to become either real friends or real enemies.  
He had his clique and I had my Peeriblah. `nuff said. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The details (bathing, eating, game playing, talking...) escape me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Was it DAF CON III OR THE FIRST SACZOMBIECON? or just a highlight of the FTF hobby’s Second Golden age?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Eventually, Mike and I gave up and drove home at a slightly more CHP friendly pace. 
The irony was that the drive back (clear and cold with freeways empty of traffic) was totally uneventful 
and boring - just like the Con, I thought. Ironically I remember the drive up vividly 
but I remember almost nothing of the drive back, perhaps because Mike did the driving and I did the sleeping.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I really don’t have anything but a few fleeting memories of brief encounters with those present 
although in future years I became friends with some of them but not, alas, Terry. 
For me he was and remained an object of distant fascination.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fourteen of the 38 people in attendance were, at one time or another publishers and/or editors of 
various gaming and Diplomacy `zines and sub-zines. 
Many of them went home and wrote up their accounts of what happened at Daf Con III. Here are just a few samples:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gary Coughlan's take... http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/oldzines/ee31.pd

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Terry Tallman's take in <i>NSWG</i>: http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/oldzines/nswg15.pdf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Steve Langley's take in <i>Magus</i>: (not available online archives, yet)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm sure there were other reports. Either read them all or read none, but don't try to read 
between the lines; and don't let what you read here shape your entire view of what happened 
at one of the best, earliest examples of a Diplomacy housecon held anywhere.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even Mike Maston, hardly a die-hard gamer or Dipper, has memories of that trip after a third-of-a-century! 
Here are his recollections:

Yes, I do still remember that trip.  We left in the late afternoon by car.  We shared the driving but 
I remember driving the last leg of the trip at around midnight or so and was extremely tired.  
That part of the drive was boring because I drove on highway 5 instead of 99.  
Upon arrival we were greeted and assigned a sleeping area.  Sleep was spotty but after waking up we ate 
breakfast provided by our hosts.  I don't remember the entire setup.  
However, I remember going into the garage where there was a large computer setup that used an eight inch floppy drive with 800K.  
I brought my ukulele and played Bach solo cello music on it.  We then all sang some folk songs to my uke accompaniment.  
I played Austria got up to 12 centers before everybody attacked me.  It was cold in Sacramento.

I learned some valuable lessons from attending Daf Con III, even though it wasn't one of my most 
memorable Dip events; and from Terry, even though he wasn't one of my best Dip buddies. 
Let me share a few of them with you:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Memories fade and change with age for most Dippers, but not always at the same pace.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Your memory may not be the best for a given event or person.  Every DipCon needs somebody like Gary Coughlan
who managed to keep track of every participant's games, bon mots, and social interactions. 
If Friedrich von Gentz was the Congress Secretary of the First Congress of Vienna in 1815; then Gary was our equivalent. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) You should read the other reports and make up your own mind about both the event and the persons.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Obviously, 1 and 2 apply to my recollections. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) However, I decided not to polish or rewrite them, but rather leave them as I initially recalled them a few hours ago. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) From reading the other accounts of the event you can decide for yourself how good my memory of those times or peerispectives  
are today.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7) It's obvious my recollections don't do Terry or Gary justice (Although, in fact, the "it" question 
was a valid one and years later Gary did, in fact, overcome his reservations and tell all, 
after I spilled the beans about what "it" was in my own "Pink Triangle" issue of <i>XENOGOGIC</i>.)
<i>((I'm sure you all know what Larry is talking about, speaking for me, I love pretty much all the
people in this hobby so much, and so didn't care anything about these matters, that I knew a lot very
early, long before people came out, and didn't care. Interestingly, Terry and I also talked about this
at the time, and he felt precisely the same way.  Although Terry always got "into" such things way more than me.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
8) So, although I didn't do Terry justice then, that doesn't mean I have to like him now:  
a thought I'm sure he would have appreciated with his diabolical sense of 
humor and reciprocated with his Peerisque personality. 
After all, Terry was to Daf Con III what Tsar Alexander I was to that aforementioned First Congress of Vienna.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
9) The lesson for you, gentle Little Putt, is to write or record in some fashion, your memories of any 
FTF Dip event you attend, especially if it's an important one to you with just a few attendees. 
Put those notes in a safe place (Better yet, write up a report for <i>DW</i> or <i>TDP</i>). 
Otherwise they will eventually be lost; and that's a true pity. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
10) Humble pie isn't always easy to eat and sometimes it doesn't taste good, 
but sometimes it's the right dish for the occasion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
11) Finally, the next time you're a bit stressed hosting a DipCon event remember 
that housecon Daf hosted for 38 guests over a four-day period while using crutches to 
get around and not once losing her cool while doing so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hard to believe, but it has been a third of a century since Daf Con III and nearly a year since Terry's passing. 
Time and Diplomacy go on, as they should. Fortunately we have memories of both scattered through the hobby’s literature.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(From my 5th email of the afternoon to Jim Burgess regarding this project...) 
A good example of how hobby Old Farts can rally together for a good reason.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"If I burn the chicken cutlets I'm cooking you owe me $8.17."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I know time is short but....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I saw the <i>EE</i> list of people at DAF III in 1983/1984. It's a very impressive list and a typical housecon of the period. 
Why not go with that for <i>DW</i>?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Feel free to send something more reworked to <b>DW</b> as desired.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll leave it to you to carry the ball on this. My plate and stove and kitchen counter is over-flowing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll CC those I can on this and perhaps you can fill in on that....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doug Beyerlein, Edi Birsan, Gary Coughlan, Don Del Grande, Pete Gaughan, Langleys, were all there. 
Duck Williams, was. Maybe the others have some memories to share?
It was a vibrant and creative bunch, perhaps second only to the original San Diego and LTA crowds. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, for those who want to learn more about Daf Con III or Terry Tallman and his place in hobby history 
I suggest you check out the online hobby archives for the following publications 
(Look for their first or second issue published in 1984):  <i>EFIGART</i> (Doug Beyerlein), ? (Edi Birsan), 
<i>EUROPA EXPRESS</i> (Gary Coughlan), <i>LIFE OF MONTY</i> (Don Del Grande), <i>LIFE OF MONTY/fnord</i> (Mike Ehli),

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is with much sadness I have discovered that Terrence N. Tallman, born on December 30, 1949, passed away on Friday March 20, 2015. 
He was 65. There isn't much information, but Terry had been a resident at Forest View Transitional Health Center in Everett, WA, 
where he tried but evidently failed to recover from a stroke; the last time I visited him was in late 2014.  
I wish I would have done more. The postcard I sent him last August was returned to sender, 
but I had (mistakenly) held out hope that he was recovered enough to have been released, 
as he mentioned to me about moving in with his brother Chet.  
Well, Terry was "released" from his suffering in another way.  
I'm sorry I never followed up. The attendant at Forest View refused to provide me information on his status, so that was a red flag.
<i>((HIPAA laws prohibit such things, unfortunately!)</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I found a posting by one of Terry's Facebook acquaintances announcing last December 30 (on his birthday) 
that he had died. Then I found an obituary on a web-based "Dignity Memorial" sponsored by the 
Purdy and Walters with Cassidy Funeral Home in Everett, WA. 
I called the funeral home, and an employee found his file and confirmed that Terry was deceased, 
and gave me his brother Chester's "Chet" phone number in Seattle. I called Chet's number 
(got his voice message) and left a message with my condolences, and asked if he wished to 
share any information about Terry, as he had friends in the Diplomacy Hobby who were 
concerned about him. If Chet calls me back with any information he wishes to share, I'll pass it along.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is an on line memorial "guest book" that will stay active through 4/21/16, 
for those who wish to leave their condolences or remembrances. The web address is: 
obits.dignitymemorial.com, or www.Purdy-Walters-Cassidy.tributes.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Terry was well-spoken with a witty, sardonic sense of humor, and I remember well his one-of-a-kind 
hand-drawn covers from his Diplomacy 'zine <i>North Sealth, West George</i> - especially the one featuring the 
"Orc" (Ozog) and the "Wimp" (John Caruso)!  Cathy was the "Valley Girl."  
I think he had nicknames (sometimes uncomplimentary), for most everyone he knew in the Diplomacy Hobby. 
If I have still have that zine cover I'll scan it and send. Terry, it was a pleasure 
knowing you over the years and playing games together at the various dip tourneys and house cons.  
You will be missed and Rest in Peace!

This message is for you and any others in the Diplomacy Hobby who knew Dwayne Shreve, 
who was a part of the Chicago Dip gang during the 1980s, and had moved to Maryland.  
I am sorry to inform you that I received a letter from his wife Carol that Dwayne 
had passed away on September 4, 2015, after losing "his valiant battle with cancer." 
She asked that we "remember him with affection."  
If you know someone else who knew Dwayne, either through the postal zines or 
in person at many of the Chicago, Milwaukee, or Madison house-cons (and once at a crummy motel in St. Louis!) 
during those carefree days, feel free to pass this message along.  
Dwayne was a likable, mellow guy, who would have a glass of wine during play; 
perhaps it made negotiating and formulating strategy and tactics easier in what is a crazy, high-strung game.

<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno (Tue, Dec 29, 2015 at 10:30 PM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Overview:  2015 was a tremendous musical year for me, driven by nearly three dozen local songwriters and their bands.  
I heard more good, creative local music than ever:  57 days with at least one show, with a few multi-band events 
and several times I attended an early show then caught someone else's last set somewhere else.  
All these were within a 50-mile radius, and most included at least a few original songs.  
Bluegrass, blues, rock, Americana, zydeco, reggae, roadhouse country, and jamband.  Not just one sound.  
There were more good local albums than ever.  There were more places to hear more original songwriters than ever.  
I danced with fun, kind, graceful women more than ever.  
I went to at least two dozen taverns and parks to hear music, and enjoyed almost every time a lot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite local songwriter: I'm leading with this category because it gave me the most memorable good times.  
A whole bunch of people wrote new songs that were really creative and fun, and in most cases their 
bandmates helped develop those songs.  One of the most prolific in 2015 was Dave Carey, 
from the Morgan String Band, The String Band, Band of Strings, and now Bug Tussle.  
Many years ago in MSB, Dave wrote "Jones Road", which is still one of my favorite instrumentals ever.  
Over the last couple of years, he's gotten back to writing really good new stuff, mostly toward the 
traditional side of bluegrass but sometimes pretty progressive, especially when BoS experimented as a 
six-piece with a drummer.  Other area songwriting favorites included Carey's bandmates Steve DeRiancho, 
Bob Kerber, and Ryan Cirbus; Driftwood's Joe Kollar, Dan Forsyth, Claire Byrne, and Joey Arcuri; 
the Falconers' Jimmyjohn McCabe and Bess Greenberg; and Dan Pokorak, Chris Merkley, Stiv Morgan, 
Mary Tewksbury, Marian Tewksbury, Rob Stachyra, Jeff Stachyra, Dan Hardy, Dan Dunham, Ed Gliha, 
Joe Alston, Aaron Lipp, Pete Ruttle, Devinne Meyers, Steve Strauss, Tim Ruffo, Randy McStine, 
John Kanazawich, Nate Marshall, Brian Potenziano, Jamie Osterhout, Jeff Kahn, and Wren Plain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite local album: the Falconers, <i>Red Roots</i>.  Jimmyjohn McCabe's guitar and Bess Greenberg's stand-up bass,  
two voices, a bunch of spirit, and a song cycle of a relationship developing through the four seasons.  
"In Deeper" was one of the songs that I picked up on over the year before the album's release.  
Jeff Stachyra's NewClear Studios did a great job capturing the band's unique sound and introducing 
each season with audio clips.  I also liked new releases from Milkweed, <i>Dream of an American Family</i>; 
Steve Strauss, <i>Sea of Dreams</i>; Marian Tewksbury, <i>Stones of Remembrance</i>; and Driftwood's Grassroots festival recordings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite local song: Devinne Meyers, "Gypsy Lullaby", solo or with East Coast Bigfoot.  
Another top pick, Steve DeRiancho's "Hippies in the Henhouse" with Bug Tussle, is getting a wonderfully fun video released soon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most total fun over the year: Counting solo and duet bits by band members, all these folks knocked it off the 
top end of the fun scale:  Driftwood, Woodshed Prophets, Digger Jones, Lutheran Skirts, the Falconers, Milkweed, 
and Band of Strings/Bug Tussle. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite band I never heard before: the Cabin Killers, at Susquehanna River Big Splash at the end of May.  
A bunch of string-band guys (including a hip fiddle) playing frenetic stuff recalling all kinds of music history.  
I cannot imagine holding still while this band plays.  
Other favorites were Thomas Wesley Stern, and the Humble Beginnings Band, twice each.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite national act in the area: the Traveling McCourys, Jan. 26 at the State Theater in Ithaca as part of the 
Winter Village Bluegrass Festival.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite secret show: Bug Tussle, Nov. 6 at the John Barleycorn in Owego.  
The place was almost empty, with nobody else paying attention, 
so I got to listen to a whole bunch of brand-new songs without interruption.  Pure heaven.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite recurring local gig: Deep Cuts Wednesdays at Callahan's Sportsman's Club in Binghamton.  
The host band is various members of Adam Ate The Apple, playing Dan Pokorak's original songs.  
They're all skilled in the structured written parts, and they all have the spirit to go off 
on wild improvisational jams.  Usually guest musicians play solo or duet guitar, sometimes original, always worth hearing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite music venue: The Ransom Steele Tavern in Apalachin was not just the best all-new place I visited, 
but the site of more first-rate musical enjoyment than anywhere else.  
An old inn with history dating to the 1830s was rebuilt by the Liberty family into a great place to listen, watch, eat, and drink.  
A three-sided balcony lets forty people watch the musicians play and interact, 
giving a more personal experience than trying to look over other people's heads.  
They focus on hosting local and regional bands making original music, and they've been choosing well since opening day in early June.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite venue for new music: Cyber Cafe West in Binghamton.  Over 15 years, this is where I met more bands I love than anywhere else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite music venue for craft beers: Galaxy Brewing in Binghamton, because they make it there.  
Other favorites are the Blind Tiger Pub between Endwell and Oakdale, the Rail House in Waverly, 
the Ransom Steele Tavern in Apalachin, and Cyber Cafe West in Binghamton.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite recording studio: NewClear Studios out somewhere in Windsor.  Jeff Stachyra, of Dirt Farm for many years, 
has been putting his equipment to good use lately, recording other bands.  
A lot of this sprung from Stephen Schweitzer's project that started with last winter's <i>Binghamton Music Vol. 1</i> CD.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Welcome to the new game start.  My house rules appear most recently in Issue #343:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/TAP343.pdf.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 I need to say that my attitude toward
house rules has evolved since being part of Thaddeus Black's current project to 
codify the rules for the game of Diplomacy.  When that is done, I will do another 
version of my House Rules acknowledging this project, but for now, assume that
when I refer to being held to "current standard hobby practice" it is represented
by the evolving consensus of that project: Diplomacy Player's Technical Guide, 
2nd Edition.  You may feel free to communicate more about this to our Austrian
player, who leads this project.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) If you aren't already on the TAP mailing list, please join it, see instructions on Page 1.
Let me know if you have problems, I will be checking up on you to make sure you're on it
as we approach the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) This issue was late as I struggled to get this game together.  I always run with 
random draws, unless all seven players demand preference lists.  This was the random
allocation, blame fate for your country assignment.  ;-) 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Ask if you have questions about anything!  The szine USUALLY comes out monthly and 
in time to appear in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> as a subszine.  We were a bit
late this month, and you get lots more reading material and two game starts as a result.
The main impact of that is that I want to make sure I don't rush Spring 1901 in only two
weeks.  I have set the tentative deadline mid-month as usual, but if anyone wants more
time, just ask for it, and Spring 1901 will go back to mid-March.  If I get such a request,
and feel free to wait to see how things go, I will announce it so you all know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Write press for publication with results.  It's fun.  I know most people don't
do much of it any more, but you will earn the eternal respect of the GM if you do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) Oh, and one last point for our "new <i>TAP</i> players", yes I adjudicate all 
games by hand and do the maps by hand.  You do need to check me, but hand adjudication
IS the only way to GM... ;-)

"Your Grace, how kind of you to journey all the way from Rome, in your current incapacity, to personally wish me goodbye. 
I regret that you are in pain and I do not wish to see you go."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I am indeed sorry, my dear Archduke, as I must sail away to recuperate in Sicily. Alas, we were just beginning to 
enjoy a fruitful relationship. But you will find my successor, Capitano Wilson, quite capable."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I beg your Pardon, Your Grace, but unfortunately the Capitano's capability is in doubt.  
I practically gift-wrapped Smyrna for the Italian fleet and he couldn't even find the harbor."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I am truly sorry, your Orczoggedness; it may have been something to do with the weather or a navigational error."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Archduke took a sip of wine from his golden goblet. "In the Mediterranean, Your Grace? In September? 
Regardless, I suppose we may try coordinating once again in the Spring. But given other military endeavors, 
surely you understand I can allow only one more try."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Signora had a pained look on her face. "Agreed. The Capitano is not known for his punctuality, 
and he will need to do more than try if he is to repulse the French fleets bearing down on the Homeland.  
But I assure you he will prevail, as I cannot have my refugio overrun." She paused for a moment.  "And what of the Czar Roadworm?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Archduke raised one eyebrow, and swept his hand across the table, bumping and nearly tipping his goblet. 
"The Czar is opportunistic, of course, but he is of no consequence. As long as one keeps feeding the Russian bear a steady diet of 
German and eventual English supply centers, he is manageable.  But Austria and Italy must remain close 
so we can grow strong from France's demise, which will serve as a counterweight to the Czar's ambitions. 
The RIA coalition will dominate Europe in the end."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Signora replied, "I certainly hope this will be the case."  She rose from her plush chair. 
"Now if you will excuse me, I have a boat waiting."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"There is just one more thing I must know, Your Grace. Could you please enlighten me on how you were 
able to send me the spumoni all the way from Venice without it melting?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the door Signora Holley turned and smiled. "There are some mysteries in this life, my dear Archduke, that may remain unexplained."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) So, as long as I don't get any other comments, with the End Game Statements below,
this one will be done.  Thanks again to everyone!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>End Game Statements:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Endgame Statement for France in Phil Reynolds:
I only was around for one season, but got a chance to contribute a little to the English win-albeit involuntarily. (Shrug)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />Endgame Statement for Germany in Phile Reynolds:
Well this game ended awfully early for me.   I guess it is only fitting that in a game memorializing Phil, 
that he’d get me once again (his spirit must have been watching over and guiding everyone against me!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hats off to everyone who outlasted me (which was pretty much everyone!) and congrats to Drew, 
who along with his lackeys (I mean friends, friends who got used and then lost!!) crushed me early, often and permanently.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Next time things will be different!!  Happy stabbing!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />Endgame Statement for Austria in Phil Reynolds:
Well, what can I say.  I was honored to play in this game because I met Phil at world DIPCON in mid 1980s in Baltimore.  
I was not very experienced and came down to join my brother Jim.  It was very memorable because I met many large names 
in the hobby, most notably, Allan Calhamer.  Phil and I played on the same board and while I don’t remember the 
countries we played, I do remember we allied and had a great game.  I did much better than I could have 
expected in my first face to face tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Regarding this game, I was in diapers when we started it... and it took so long... 
I have to wear them again now that it has finished.  Seriously, I thought I knew which way this game was 
going to end a long time ago, but the Diplomacy gods proved me wrong.  
I think the changes in players really threw a few wrenches into the game. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My favorite move of the game was the multi-player convoy of my army from the West back to the East to attack Russia.  
He thought he had me on the ropes and it was a pivotal turn in the game for me. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As frustrating as Mike (Russia) was to work with, we had many enjoyable back and forth E-mails.  
He just never considered any of the offers that I made to him.  He kept saying that after 
I stabbed Johnny(Italy), it was his duty to avenge the stab and attack me.  
No matter how nice an offer I gave him.  He would never work with me.  That is one regret, 
that he would have given me a chance to work together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have many E-mails with Drew discussing our shared love of Syracuse sports.  It was a pleasure to work with him.  
We were on the same page for a long period of time and our alliance and the friendship we developed was probably 
the #1 thing I will take away from this game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All in all, it was a very good game.  I’ll take a second place survival with my ally getting the win.  
It was great working with Drew.  I really wish we could have gotten Johnny back to Italy for the last move.  
That would have been classic.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks Jim for letting me play and all your hard work over the years.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />Endgame Statement for England in Phil Reynolds:
Wow!  I never thought that this game would end!  I entered the game in partnership with my youngest son, 
Nate, who had "discovered" Diplomacy when he was in junior high school and wanted to play a game in a zine. 
This game went on longer than it took him to graduate from both high school and college.  
Before he went away to school we enjoyed setting up the game on the dining room table and working out our moves.  
As he moved out of the house he continued to ask for updates on how we were doing.  
The only downside of his interest was that when he went to college he took my Diplomacy game with him so 
it became harder for me to work out orders.  
It was fitting that he was home for the holidays when the game was won.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is hard to remember how the game progressed over the years.  Early on, if I remember correctly, 
we formed an alliance with Marc (Germany) against France, but Johnny Crow in Italy messed that up by heading north.  
Eventually I took the chance of stabbing Marc and switching my alliance to France who was being played by 
Don Williams.  Don was an outstanding player and I enjoyed getting to know him a little bit.  
He would call me up to coordinate moves which was a little bit of a challenge given our 3 hour time difference.  
The first time he called he spoke with my wife who got out of bed to answer a late hour call!   
It was shocking to me when he sent me a note saying that he would have to drop out of the game and died shortly thereafter.  
It shook me up enough that I was ready to throw in the towel and end the game, 
but in hindsight I'm glad that Jim and the other players kept the game going as I think Don would have wanted us to continue.  
Don, this game was for you!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At that point and until the end I was able to leverage the animosity between Russia and Austria Hungary.  
They both were more interested in stopping the other from coming in second than in joining together to stop the English.   
David was a pleasure to work with in my final stab of France.  Coordinating moves with David 
each turn was almost as enjoyable as discussing the trials and tribulations of the SU basketball and football teams.  
I feel as though I rode on the backs of the strong playing of first Don and then David to the solo win.  
Oh, I really was willing a few years back to have an A/E/F draw.  
I only started to vote "no" on draws when it became very clear that I couldn't be stopped.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Many thanks to the players, especially Melinda, who stepped in to take over difficult positions.  
Johnny, you hung on to to the bitter end - too bad you didn't get back to a home SC.  
I'm curious to know how many different players played in this game and how many 
original players were there at the end.  Many thanks, Jim, for carrying on a great zine and doing an excellent job of GMing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((You can see all that above.  Five countries were completely played out by the original players, pretty good for a
game that went on this long.  The other two had a fair bit of turnover, and it surely affected the game.
Congratulations to you on your solo!))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We do have seven players.  My intent it to play to the rules, with the overcrowding rule used only on the first turn.
I recognize that some large replenishment cards after that are possible, but we'll go with it and see how it plays.
