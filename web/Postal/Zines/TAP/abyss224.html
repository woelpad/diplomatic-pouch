<p><br><p><br><b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE WILL BE OCTOBER 24, 1999 - IT'S BACK!</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Join us for the Diplomatic Incident in Boston on October 2nd and 3rd.
I realize we are missing the postal press again this issue, but I need
to get this issue out to people before the Incident.

<p>
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: It is likely that we will have to alter the
location of the Convention.  Plans have not been finalized as of this
writing, but if you are planning to attend, contact me NOW.
I will keep a list and notify you of the UP-TO-DATE plans as we make them.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow John Caruso's postal
baseball league that I am in.
My Boston Red Sox in that league have captured the Eastern Division
title and go up against Lance Phillips' Anaheim Angels, Gary Behnen's
Blue Jays finish dead last, Don Ditter's Indians think they have a clean
path to the World Series, but really haven't the starting pitching to
make it, I'll beat them if Richard Edison's Twins don't beat me to it,
Dave Anderson's Tigers beat me up badly on the last turn, but fail to 
beat out the Twins for the last playoff spot by one game, Kitton (Mets)
and Eric Voogd (Reds) get into the playoffs in the National League and
are MY favorites to reach the World Series.... meanwhile, in "real life",
my Red Sox still continue to surge.
Quake in your boots you damned Yankees!!

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR MICHAEL HOPCROFT</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>I suspect Michael will be really easy to find, so I have a backup
suggestion from Brad Wilson if you do.  You have until issue #230
to find Michael but if you find him by next issue, I'll insert
Brad's choice.
I ***DO*** take suggestions.
Many people have been suggesting people I've never heard of though,
so you've got to give me an explanation as to why they would be
fun to find.

<p>
Let's get Kevin, Garret, Jerry, and Al found too!!!
 
<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
Steve Hutton picked up fifty bucks US last time and I also awarded
him a lifetime sub.
Go for it!

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p> Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what 
stance we (the hobby) should take (proactive in some way for sure) 
toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.
No word on precisely what this means yet, could it mean that
they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?
Stay tuned....
If you want to be part of the discussion, send the MESSAGE:

<p>
subscribe hasbro

<p>
to majordomo of diplom.org, it works just like the tap mailing list
described below.  Sending messages to hasbro of diplom.org
sends the mail to the whole list.
The big news this time is the beginning of the breakout of
Hasbro into official contact with the hobby.
See the two messages below.

<p>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<p>
This first note will annoy all of those who keep trying to convince me
that the hobby is dying, when it most emphatically is not.  And, I would
argue, that if it weren't for how busy we ALL are getting these days,
more of this activity would also be associated with szines.
To some extent it is already, but the GM's are just a little less
``organized'' about it.....

<p>
The 1346 games that were finished between Sept 1, 1998 and Aug 31,
1999 featured a total of 3251 different players, according to the
Diplomacy Resignation Record database.  This number is slightly inaccurate,
as (a) some duplicate registrations haven't been paired together yet,
and (b) some temporary replacements or mercy-position replacements
aren't included in the total.  Also, a small number of games never make
it into the database, for various reasons.

<p>
But it's probably pretty close.

<p>
Of the 3251, over half played only one game.  Less than 1000 played
more than two games, and less than 500 played as many as five games.

<p>
In fact, here's a distribution of number of players who played a
certain number of games, where each * represents 50 players:

Don Del Grande's WDC Charter is interestingly prescriptive in its non-
prescriptiveness. (``You may not be prevented from doing x.") I note his
remarks about one zone for Europe. Personally I don't see this as an
issue, because there are only 3 zones at the moment. Approximately 1/3
of the WDCs in the UK &amp; Europe sounds about right. Of the main UK cons,
Manorcon is not likely to ever want to bid again, and now Midcon is run
by the Furrycon lads, I doubt they will want it either. So if WDC is to
take place in the UK again, it will probably be at a smaller con like
Mastercon - or, at the other extreme, the Mind Sports Olympiad.

<p>
At work, I am part of a group of 20+ consultants. We all used to have
direct line responsibility to the Head of Consultancy, but this was too
wide a span of control. We have now been re-organsied into teams of
consultants under Senior Consultants. I have been appointed as the team
leader for the consultants who do not belong to any team. I think this
is the first time that I have come across Bertrand Russell's ``Class of
All Classes" paradox in real life.

<p>
Re. Richard Weiss and prepositions. I seem to remember a story about one
of Winston Churchill's speeches, which had been assigned to a civil
servant for checking. He corrected a preposition at the end of a
sentence only to have WSC excise the correction with the comment ``This
is the sort of impudence up with which I will not put!"
<i>((This comment of Churchill's is infamous.))</i>

I suspect the only irrevokable rule in the English language is that

<p>There is still time to send in your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
I'm going to have to delay Part III of the lists plus some other music
material for this issue.
Apologies to those whose letters are slow to come into print.

<p>
<p><br>
<center>***TIME TO VOTE - ABSOLUTE LAST CHANCE!!! - DEADLINE OCTOBER 9***</center><br>

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
five songs (2 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than two votes on any one song IN THIS LAST ROUND, see below.
You also get ONE B-52 song vote (although you can add votes from your
main allotment if desired) and THREE Drug Song votes which will be
held in a separate category (also no more than two votes per song though).
The other ``special'' bullpens must be voted on from your main allotment
of votes.
I decided that I WILL print running totals and print the names of the
people who have voted.
Also, you guys wrote some great stuff about the songs, so I've printed
that too!
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!
Everything that started in the bullpen started with one vote.

<p>
LAST CHANCE COMMENTS: ``Love Shack'' and ``Rock Lobster'' are running neck
and neck.
I may take both of them depending on how many votes they get against
the rest of the bullpen.
In the regular bullpen, the ones with at least seven votes I think are
definitely in, but there's a big bunch at six and I don't think I will
take them all!!
I reserve the right to take my choices as tiebreakers if they don't all fit.
As of this moment, I am looking for 90 minutes of songs, but I haven't started
adding up all of the timings yet.
``Paint It Black'' and ``Take Me To the River'' (I'm inclined to use the live
version from the video album) look safely in, but no other Heads or Stones
songs have gotten widespread support.
At this point, I'm also inclined to take no more George Clinton songs after
``Atomic Dog'' and to grab ``YMCA''.
Finally, I think I'll do two ``drug'' song breaks, one on each side of the
tape, so ``Red Red Wine'' is likely to be in and I will take the Fraternity of Man
(by personal fiat since it was mentioned in <i>Outside Providence</i>)
to break a tie there if it still exists.
These could change a lot if I get a lot of votes, BUT (IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!):

<p>
TO STOP ANY LAST MINUTE BALLOT STUFFING, NO SONG MAY GET MORE THAN TWO VOTES
PER VOTER FOR THIS LAST ROUND!!!

<p>
To encourage voting early, five voters at random will receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff).
I'm also giving the round one voters below five chances in said drawing,
those in the second round four, and so on, to more heavily penalize the
chances of those last minute voters and reward these pioneers!
This should do it, last chance is NOW!!
The last prize will be awarded in issue 225 and in #226 I will announce
the final list of songs.
Get your final votes in now if you don't see your name below!!!
You each will receive two chances in the drawing for the next 
five dollar prize. 
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson,
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters are John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
In future drawings these people will
have five chances, just as the Round 1 voters.
Round 2 E-Mail voters get four chances and are Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters are Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch;
they get three chances to win.
Round 4 voters are Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee (2 votes left), and Andy York; they get two chances.
Round 5 voters so far include Mark Larzelere (still has 5 votes left, I gave
5 of his votes to ``Echo Beach''), and that's it.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; something from the B-52's;
the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);

<p>
Boy, Rip Gooch sure looks bad with the timing of your issue.  Let's
look at the Wild Card standings today.

<p>
Boston W:81 L:61 GB:-

<p>
Oakland W:75 L:64 GB:3

<p>
Toronto W:75 L:68 GB:6.5

<p>
Right now, the Red Sox are 4.5 games behind the Yankees, and 3.5 behind
the Rangers.  The Jays are basically dead - they are 7 behind in the
loss column with 20 games left.  
<i>((Even more so today, as I write this....))</i>
Oakland could pass the Sox, but I
don't think it will happen.  People say ``but the Sox have to play the
Indians and the Yankees!"  Well, so far they are 2-0 against the Yanks
this weekend, with the suddenly vulnerable Rocket Man pitching today.
As for the Indians, they've already clinched.  Plus the Sox have been
beating up on them all season.   The Sox match up well against the
Indians, since the Indians have little pitching, while the Sox's
pitching is good enough to stop even the Indians' bats.  (Well, at
least Pedro is - his 17K job against the Yankees was quite something.)
<i>((Indeed, and both the Yankees and the Red Sox beat up on the
``clinched'' Indians.))</i>

<p>
I would be surprised to see the Yankees make the World Series this
year - their ``aces", Clemens and Cone, are not pitching well.
Cleveland has got a ton of hitting, but might really have a problem in
round 1 with the Sox.  Given that the Indians cannot beat Pedro, they
would have to sweep the 3 games he did not start.  Sadly, they did
exactly that last year.  I've got a hunch the Rangers could finally
make the Series this year.  Palmiero is as hot as any other hitter in
the AL, their starting pitching is solid, while their bullpen is the
best in the AL.  It's really hard to guess - the top 3 (Cleveland, NY,
Texas) seem pretty evenly balanced, while the Sox could beat any of
them if they get just a bit of good luck.  
<i>((That's just about the way I see it, too.
But I think the Sox have at least as good a chance as any of them do to
make it to the Series.))</i>

<p>
As for Oakland, I don't know much about them.  Apparently Tim Hudson
and Kevin Appier are pitching well, and they've got a lot of big
sluggers like Jason Giambi, Matt Stairs, etc.  I think they might pass
the Sox, but if they did they would lose in the first round to either
the Yankees or the Indians.  
<i>((The Orioles will decide it, lots of games against the Sox and
that crazy make-up doubleheader because of Floyd rainouts [Oakland must
sweep that].))</i>

<p>
The NL also seems wide open this year.  Just when I was about to count
out the Reds, they starting hitting like crazy.  And the Astros have
won 9 in a row.  I don't know which of the four (Braves, Mets, Astros,
Cincinnati) will miss the playoffs, but it probably won't be the
Braves.  Maddux looks to be back on form, but he (like Clemens) has
never been much of a postseason pitcher.  Look out for Arizona with
Randy Johnson pitching as well as anybody not named Pedro.  Still, it
is noteworthy that Johnson has lost a lot of games where his team has
not scored for him.  If they cannot get a <i>hit</i> against Jose Jimenez,
who has since been sent to the minors, how will they get runs against
Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz?  The Astros have Caminiti back, and two
great starters in Hampton and Lima, as well as sluggers Bagwell and
Biggio.  Will this be the year they finally make the Series?  

<p>
Well, hell, teams from Texas have been kicking butt this year - the
Stars won the Stanley Cup, the Spurs won the NBA championship, the
Comets won the WNBA.  And Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France (an
amazing story which means he already should be given the SI Sportsman
of the Year award).  So, I'll go nuts and pick an Astros-Rangers World
Series!  The New York media will cry themselves to sleep - this is the
best opportunity for a Subway Series in memory.  But the Yankees
should have known better than to go after Clemens.  He's always been
just good enough to lose in the postseason.  All any other team would
need to do is put Dave Stewart on the mound.  :)

<i>((And a late postscript....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 21 Sep 1999 13:37:12)</b>

<p>
So, the A's are still very much in the penant race.  With two weeks
left, they were 4.5 games behind the Red Sox for the wild card.

<p>
Last night, they played a game in Oakland, and 6,512 people showed up.
<i>((Very, very sad, don't they see how they are ensuring that
the team they have must be broken up as a result???))</i>

<p>
I find that mind-boggling.  An exhibition game in Boston would get
more fans, even if the Sox were 20 games below .500.

<p>
Part of the reason teams like Cleveland and Baltimore can afford to
spend money on players, and teams like Oakland and Kansas City cannot,
is that fans actually attend games in Cleveland and Baltimore, while
the A's and the Royals have been essentially abandoned by their fans.

<p>
You could say - well, the fans don't like supporting a team which has
no chance.  But when less than 7,000 people show up for a game which
has important playoff implications with less than two weeks left in
the season, then the fans have to take some of the blame.

<p>
Mornin', Jim-Bob -

<p>
I just checked Providence's current weather on the internet, and it
looks like the storm has gone on to Maine.  I hope you fared okay.  The
sun is shining here in scenic Virginia Beach, and the weather jocks
promise us four days of sunny skies and temperatures in the 70's.  This
must be our reward for enduring the hurricane.  Did I accidentally say
something about Ontario?
<i>((I dunno.
Yeah, if I had kept my class the extra half hour instead of letting them
out early it all would have been gone before I had to go out and drive in it.
It dumped all sorts of rain on Danbury, Connecticut as a consolation prize.))</i>

<p>
I still haven't heard much about storm damage in the Carolinas, where it
presumably is the worst.  Things near here are worse than I had heard
yesterday - 100,000 people without power, and that water treatment
plant may be out of commission until some time next week.  (I think I
could get by more easily without power than I could without running
water.)  I saw news footage of homes covered in flood water up to their
roofs - literally the whole house was inundated.  And this is about 40
miles from where I live.  Somehow it seems otherworldly when it happens
in Pakistan, half a world away, but when it's your neighbors' homes . .
. very sobering.  Anyway, I am one lucky damned fool.

<p>

<center>Hope you're well, and dry.  Best wishes. Steve, Lse of SykesCarnes.com</center><br>

<p>
Hi Jim,

<p>
Most delighted to see word from Steve Hutton and Alan Stewart in the
latest TAP.  Both were among my favorite pubbers and favorite folks to
game with at cons.
<i>((Great, they're around for the duration now.))</i>

<p>
I'm on vacation headed for Yellowstone in a few hours... will return
Sept 26.  Expect e-mail from me at the Munson account or from another
Gardiner account... I'll include a password such as Al Pearson's
nickname so you know it's not Scott pretending to be me.  If I don't
turn up, it's probably just another Barnomobile breakdown like the one
that caught me enroute home from Vertigo Games.

<p>

<center>Mike, mpbarno of lightlink.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((What would a Mike Barno trip be without a Barnomobile breakdown??
You have to be the absolute world expert on decision making when breaking
down with a car in a strange place.
You know when to hold 'em (and where and how to get things fixed) and you
know when to fold 'em (when to abandon the car and buy a new Barnomobile
to get you on your way).
I'd be clueless, basically.
Next up we have another installment in something else that I clearly am
clueless on, the positions of Jody and Rick on our foreign policy
debate.
Here's Rick's latest attempt to clean it up....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Sun, 12 Sep 1999 15:34:12)</b>

<p>
In the letter, you make it seem as though I'm giving a back-and-forth
with Jody.  That is not exactly how it happened.

<p>
Let's see...

<p>
I said ``if the Republicans can flagrantly and willfully illegally
sell arms as part of a hare-brained foreign policy, and escape
punishment, on what grounds is the current impeachment based?"  

<p>
Jody emphasizes my usage of the word ``part" to infer that I was
somehow criticizing all Republican foreign policy.  Note, however, the
usage of the word ``a", as in ``a hare-brained foreign policy".  An
administration has policies with regards to many different things.
These policies can be sometimes independent.  The usage of the word
``a" could be seen to imply that there are many other foreign
policies.  
<i>((Yes, and there clearly are different, possibly independent
foreign policies.
I am a BIG believer in not making any organization into a ``monolith''
where all decisions are connected.
They seldom are.))</i>

<p>
Regardless, Jody inferred something which I did not say, and then
proceded to criticize me for it.  

<p>
Regarding ``I suggest you read up a bit more" - I had no other response
to Jody feigning a lack of understanding behind the motives of NATO
involvement in Serbia.  Let's look at exactly what Jody said, which he
has omitted in his ``I feel insulted" letter:

<p>
(from <i>TAP</i> 218)
`It was interesting to hear Rick Desper talk about Clinton and mention
Reagan's ``hare-brained" foreign policy. And Clinton's foreign policy
would be... what? It seems to be something like: threaten a lot and
use bombs a lot. And what exactly are we doing in Kosovo anyway? Did
we accomplish what we set out to do?'

<p>
I'm sorry, but when Jody says that he thinks Clinton's foreign policy
is to ``threaten a lot and use bombs a lot", then he's trivializing the
issue.  I feel fully justified in calling this criticism a ``cheap
shot".  When he feigns ignorance about what the goals are, I think
it's OK to tell him to read up on the issue.  

<p>
Jody claims to not to want to be getting into a Net-type flame war,
but if this really were his desire, he could avoid the type of
behavior which causes so many of these flame wars.  I find this
problem happens a lot on r.g.d.  Somebody will say something, I will
criticize what they say, and then they will reply to my criticism by 
omitting and mischaracterizing the original objectionable comment.
<i>((Yeah, I do like to keep things above that here.
I hope we will be able to do so, while showing John Boardman
that people in Diplomacy szines are still interested in discussing
foreign policy issues and REAL Diplomacy.
I think they are, I know I am.))</i>
This type of behavior bugs me.  If a person is unwilling to stand
behind something he said, either admit it and move on, clarify, or
leave it be.  Please don't pretend that the original statement was not
said at all.  

<p>
Had Jody's <i>TAP</i> 218 letter been as reasoned as his latest letter, he
would not have earned the sarcastic response that he got.  
<i>((I say cut people some slack and let them do a lil' weaselin'
to get out of a tough scrape, if you know what I mean.... but I do
know what you mean too.))</i>

<p>
At the time (this was a few months ago), I found myself in the
position of The American in my workplace.  I found that, although
Germany is a member of NATO, some Germans think that they have to do
what the US wants, and they are resentful of their role in NATO.  I
had numerous discussions with my German teacher (in German, mind you)
in which he was saying the kind of thing where the US is just an
imperialist power, we're bombing the country without caring about
things.  Other people say Americans view the whole thing as a video
game.  I take exception to this kind of argument.  

<p>
I quote ``Rick seems to subscribe to the idea of Stopping the Ethnic
Cleansing....We didn't stop the cleansing, we accelerated it."  This
is the logic of appeasement.  If we have one set of people pursuing a
policy which violates any reasonable concept of human rights, and the
attempt to stop them by a second set of people leads to the first set
doing more violations of human rights, then who is to blame?  Jody
would have us believe that the attempt to stop ethnic cleansing caused
the ethnic cleansing.  I think the answer is simpler - the guilty
party is the guilty party, not the party trying to police things.
The whole idea, which many media members subscribed to, that the US
``provoked" the ethnic cleansing, is ridiculous.  
<i>((You will admit that there are some fuzzy issues in this one,
I hope, ranging from the clear violation of existing international
law by sticking our nose into a civil war (justified in my eyes as
a greater good, to be sure, but still the facts) to the continuing 
screwy attempts to have ``clean'' takeovers while REAL people are
dying on the ground.
Sorry, it isn't ``clean'' if ethnic Albanians (or East Timorese, for
that matter) are dying.  
They're people too and they ``count''.))</i>

<p>
I have not wanted to put myself forward as a Clinton apologist.  But I
would prefer it is people criticizing his actions would do so
intelligently, not glibly.  In <i>TAP</i> 223, Jody did the former, in <i>TAP</i>
218, the latter.  This makes me feel that my comments served a
purpose.

<p>

<center>Rick, R.Desper of dkfz-heidelberg.de</center><br>

<p>
<i>((And I would agree, and hope that Jody does too.))</i>

Hi Jim-Bob,
Just a note from a long lost old fart...

<p>
Frauke and I are expecting our first child in December. Totally
unplanned and unexpected, but it will be a good change. She'll take at
least a year off work (in Germany, a parent can take up to 3 years
unpaid ma-/paternity vacation). We'll see what will happen after that.

<p>
For any other old farts who may remember us, we have a new web journal

weekly, and even Frauke is writing some stuff. She could always be
much more creative than I.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The next Breaking Away is filling that will appear here.
See details under the Breaking Away game below.
The other game is starting in <i>Tinamou</i>.
See the subszine for more details next time it appears (I hope that is next issue).

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I am open to suggestions on the latter, though I want to print maps and
***I*** don't know how to make the rings rotate easily.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Stephen Agar claims the Borg and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this soon.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of it refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.  
If you are interested, contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at:

<p><br><p><br>I have the players for the new game and the country assignments.
They are -
Austria: Dan Gorham (paid), England: John Biehl (paid), France: Sean O'Donnell

Russia: Buddy Tretick (free), Turkey: Randy Ellis (paid).
I did a random draw since I did not have preferences from everyone.
Those of you that I haven't heard from in awhile should drop me a line to
ensure that they are still in the game (if you fall in that category I
will note it in your issue, I have Rick Davis set to be the backup player).
I will provide addresses to the players with this issue and will put up
the game ``for real'' next time.
The deadline will not be until sometime in November and I will announce it

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Supply Center Chart should be checked carefully (and I'm sure
will be by my faithful Robert Stimmel).
Persia and Peru were the only centers I found with non-unique first
three letters.
You'll let me know if there are others.
The centers in CAPITAL letters are ones in which you potentially
can build.
Obviously, if you have a unit in that place, you can't build there.
This is just marking the buildable centers for you and for me.
Note that the Winter build deadline follows immediately and then Spring
not long after.
This game has been so slow to start that I'm worried about the 
new pace.
Humor me and get your orders in on time!
Thanks!!

<p>
2) Remember that the ORDERS above are the official results.
I have included a map again for your use.
I know it will be useful for me and hope it will be useful for you.
If my drawing is unclear or in error, as it undoubtedly will be at times,
don't sweat it too much.

<p>
3) I think Stan Johnson has moved again, at least the phone number listed
above is disconnected.
If anyone knows anything about this, contact me ASAP as that Winter build
deadline will be on us VERY quickly.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Jim Sayers should be returning around the time you see this.

<p>
2) Richard Pinelli has not returned and is officially out.
Stan Johnson may have moved, his phone number has been disconnected
and I don't have orders from him either.
We must move on, so I have NBRed Germany, reluctantly.
I have also called Mike Barno as a second standby.
I have reason to believe that I am ***VERY*** likely to be able to
quickly engage Mike into the game, but the standby position is still
Stan's if he gets back to me by the deadline.
Orders MAY be made conditional on who is ordering the German units.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TRAVEL BROCHURE): ``Welcome to Rome one of the most exciting and historical
cities in the world!" hmm, worth a visit...

<p>
(AUS-ITA): Good luck with your plan.  Killing me quickly does not aid
you in the long term.  I hope you are ready to fight a two-front war
in the north and south.

<p>
(AUS-RUS): I don't predict a long life for you.  Sorry about that.

<p>
(STATE ALLOWED PRESS RELEASE, FROM THE OFFICE OF JOHNNY MUSTAFA):
The Sultan has shown a rise in spirits since `restocking' his harem with 
numerous women from the Crimea region. It would appear that the Sultan has a 
healthy appetite for `childbearing hips.'
The output of the Sultan's factories has gone up 26% in the past month 
alone, allowing the building and maintenance of a fleet and the formation of 
a new regiment.        
The economy, driven primarily by slave labor, is at an all time high. 
The Sultan is pleased.

<p>
(DR. VINNIE GOOMBA to MOSCOW): We will gladly attempt to cure the Tsar of
any and all illness. May we suggest a certain priest whose nickname is
Ras to advise him and pray for a cure.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Someone asked what the point was to the Summer season in this game.
Quite frankly, it is press, and the chance to have six weeks to devise
Fall moves!!!
This one is REALLY complicated, as I see it!!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JODY to BOOB): An experienced editor like yourself ought to be able to tell
a typo from a spelling mistake. Spelling school won't be neccesary. You're
trying to get yourself nuked again, aren't you? BTW, that wasn't actually
directed at anyone in particular. But if the cap fits  ;-)
<i>((Hey, I'm always looking to get nuked.
I've learned to enjoy it.
I then feel better when you stop!))</i>

<p>
(WEBSTERS to NITPICKERS): Yes, it was a joke.

<p>
(GERMANS to TURKS): I'm not sure I agree with your ``get the leader" idea. In
fact, I'm pretty sure I don't agree with it.

<p>
(GERMANS to ITALIAN REMAINS): Trying to get nuked every turn, right?

<p>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Not much going down.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ALL): Just FYI. I will be moving on from the telecom industry after a two-year stint (Amen to that). I will have a new email address in place sometime during the week of Sept. 20th. 

<p>
(JAMES to KINNEY): Strange how growing powers with solid positions rarely
have to bring in a standby.  Thanks for picking up France.  It is tough to
have to lay in a bed you didn't make.  By the way, I'll take a real long
shot - you don't happen to have a relative who is a retired admiral do you?

<p>
(NEW FRANCE to GERMANY): I believe you - indeed, this is what I get for
only playing standby shots (although that last outing as Italy way back
when was practically a complete game - the Hermit, wasn't it?)  I've been
a bit out of touch.

<p>
(LONDON TIMES): After much turmoil a new regime has taken over leadership of
the exiled French government.  Our victorious BEF has arrived in Brest while
our allies are marching through Paris.  The remaining units of the French
fleet are in rapid retreat and it appears as though the decimated fleet may
be scuttled in the near future.  Our government has ordered a fleet into the
Med to seek out and destroy any remaining French ships which refuse to
surrender.

<p>
(JAMES to EMMERT AND GOZ): I am not a baseball fan, but I have been
following your press with interest.  I have a question for you guys - why
doesn't anyone really follow college baseball while college football and
basketball are so popular?  Is it really just the obvious answer that
baseball takes place during summer break?  Is it because baseball has minor
leagues, while football and basketball don't?  The college versions of
basketball and football are far superior to the pro versions - no talk of
strikes, salaries, etc and the teams turnover every year to keep it all
interesting.  Any thoughts?

<p>
(COMMISSIONER GOZ to BOOB): WHAT?!?!?!?  You want a SOLUTION?!?!?  I don't
get to just mouth off at you?  Ok, I guess that's fair, since it's your rag.
I hinted at an outline of it last time, but the whole solution would take up
more paper than the Starr report.
        
<p>
To start with, you don't have to make it ``illegal" for local
governments to support teams.  The governments should be smart enough to not
do it on their own.  If local businesses wnat to buy overpriced luxury boxes
to entertain clients that's ok, as long as it isn't tax-deductible.  We have
enough government intervention here, we need less, especially in terms of money.
        
<p>
Consider that Congress has given Major League Baseball an Anti-trust
exemption.  Let's make them earn it.  Make MLB ONE company, period.  One
CEO, 30 district managers.  Ok, the district managers can own and promote
their own teams, and can be given SOME financial incentive to do so.  BUT,
the CEO takes a tax on EVERY dollar that any team makes, be it gate
receipts, cable TV rights, concession stands, warm-up jackets, etc.  The
Yankees will always be more popular than the Royals will, and that's ok.
But there's got to be SOME redistribution of wealth or the Royals will never
compete.  So 75 cents on every dollar goes to MLB, and then they divvy that
up 31 ways (hey, the commissioner needs my, er, his cut too) and send it to
the teams as next year's salaries.  If a team can't live within that amount
that's too bad.  You can bank it until next year, but you can't borrow on
the next one.
        
<p>
You probably don't need the whole thing to be even across the board,
but you DO need it closer than it is now.  I believe the above paragraph
solves the sins of significantly unequal revenue from one spot to another,
AND keeps teams from holding cities hostage, since it's always the teams on
the bottom doing that.
        
<p>
Are their holes in the above?  Probably.  Do I care?  Not until they
make me commissioner, so I likely won't write anything on this again.  The
above postulates a real strong commissoner's office, and right now the
owners don't have an incentive to have anyone but "Puppet" Selig there, but
it HAS to happen that way.
        
<p>
As a last note, the observant of you who have known me for the last
41 years will note that this is a pretty damned socialistic solution coming
from a free-market type.  I re-create below a conversation I had on a plane
with a complete stranger during the strike of '94:
        
<p>
HIM:  Don't get me wrong, I'm a free-market guy and think the
players ought to make all that they can.
        
<p>
ME:  Ok Mr. Free-Market, let's say that you and I have just been
given the keys to the next 2 expansion teams.  Where are you going to put
yours?  What city?
        
<p>
HIM:  Uh, um, er, well I guess I'd put it...
        
<p>
ME:  I'm putting mine in New York City.  (Quick head-turn my way
from HIM)  Sure.  There's 15 million people in that market, that would make
it 5 million each for me, the Yankees and the Mets.
        
<p>
HIM:  But the Yankees and Mets would never let you put one there.
        
<p>
ME:  Then it's not a free market, is it?

<p>
(STEVE to GOZ): I enjoyed reading your baseball rant.  I had thought the
economic inequality issue was fairly new until I saw the HBO special,
``When It Was a Game 2" in which they discussed this very issue in the
context of the 30's and 40's.  Ever wonder why the Washington Senators
and St. Louis Browns never won pennants?  It's not because they had
perpetually bad scouting or poor managers.  It's that the Yankees and
Giants and Cardinals had so much more money in those days.  They
described a situation in which the Yankees went to one cash-strapped
team and said, ``we want your third baseman, Kadiddlehopper."  ``But he's
the best player on our team!"  ``We know," the Yankees replied, ``that's
why we want him."  And they got him, because the other team couldn't
refuse the money.  Remember the Curse of the Babe?  Ruth went to the
Yankees for six figures in cash - and a mortgage on Fenway Park!  The
Red Sox were so poor, they needed a loan on the ballpark just to stay
afloat.  Anybody who thinks this is a new phenomenon would be interested
to read about this stuff.

<p>
(DESPER): Even though you tried to start a fight between me and Goz, I agree
with everything he said this issue about baseball.  The problem lies
not, however, in the stadiums.  The Yankees have a huge stadium that
they hardly ever sell out.  The problem is money.  Which comes from
television.  In the NFL and NBA, TV money is split between teams,
which then have very restrictive salary limits.  Although this has not
prevented the Clippers from always being terrible, these two leagues
are generally more competitive than baseball is.  Well, at least
potentially.  The NFL certainly is, as we saw with the instant
successes in Carolina and Jacksonville.  The NBA is only in a
potential sense.  In any given year, the distance between the top
teams in the NBA and the bottom teams is much wider than it is in any
other professional league in the US.  But even a small-market team
like San Antonio can win the championship.  (Of course, the fact that
there's a salary cap for the first three years helps a lot, since Tim
Duncan was a 2nd year player last year.)  

<p>
Baseball does not share revenue, which means that the big money
franchises earn money which is an order of magnitude higher than what
other cities make.  I think Montreal's total revenue would not cover
Pedro Martinez's salary.  While I love the fact that he came to
Boston, it is a sign of the market unfairness that he did.  Most of
the top-spending teams (Yankees, Mets, Braves, Red Sox, Indians,
D-Backs) are in position to make the postseason.  The notable
exception is the Orioles.  Oakland qualifies as small-market, and so
would Cincinnati, but they might both miss the playoffs.  

<p>
My only bone of contention is the idea that the Cubs are a
small-market team.  Chicago is the 3rd-largest city in the country,
and while it has two teams, the Cubs get more support from fans with
money than the White Sox do.  They should certainly be able to keep up
with Cleveland and Baltimore, and probably should be able to keep up
with Atlanta.  Their failure to do so I ascribe to general
administrative incompetence.  Also, Goz is missing a big factor in
comparing the Cubs of last year and the Cubs of this year.  Their
failure this year has a lot more to do with the injury to Kerry Wood
then it does to any structural problem which allows them only to
compete only once every four years.   Let's see how they do when Wood
comes back next year.

<p>
(NOSTRADAMUS SPEAKS): The new France dies, saddled with the poor position
crafted by his predecessor.  Turkey dies a lingering death, after which
Italy and Russia stab Austria, who dies quickly.  England invades the
Mediterranean in force, while Germany pours armies overland into Russia.
Russia and Italy fend off the invaders for a time, until Italy sells
Russia out for thirty pieces of silver and three Russian dots.  The
remaining three take Russia out, and then there's a big swirl of
negotiations over who will be the odd man out.  The game-long
cooperation between Germany and England wins out, and Italy is
victimized, eventually dyin-

<p>
Wait, this was supposed to be all cryptic and everything, right?
Criminy.  I can't believe I've fallen into literalism.  Maybe I should
just write operas - still lots and lots of brotherhood, treachery, and
death.  My favorite stuff, all rolled up into one package.  Oh, well.
I'm out of the Dip business for a while.  You guys are on your own.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD): They drop the puck in two weeks, boys.  Life
begins again.

<p>
(FROM SOMEWHERE IN PARIS): The detective, brought in at the request of the
German high command, looked at the paperwork on the desk in the former
office of the French chief executive.  He scowled, in that way that
detectives can scowl at other people's problems and pretend that they've
embraced them as their own.  The clues were all too familiar though, and so
the scowl was the same as it had been then, so many years ago in
Constantinople.  He'd been here too.  He'd fled again, but to where?  Once
again, just beyond the grasp.  He was good, this one, and he'd appear again.
Where?  When?

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA, ITALY, AND RUSSIA): So, it's gonna take all three of
you brave warriors to take out little old Turkey, eh?  All right, c'mon,
puddem up, pudddemmmmm uuuuuuuup!

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ENGLAND): Funny, I've been pondering that myself. I suppose I'll know for sure after the results are in.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) David Partridge's new game start will start in <i>Tinamou</i> this issue.
For the game here, send your team names and cards now!!
This means: David Partridge, 
John Schultz, Tom Howell, Harry Andruschak,
Eric Brosius, and John Harrington.
We'll be playing Version 2.3 of the rules as published a few issues back.
I think I have orders only from John Harrington and Tom Howell so far....
plus team name and rider names from Harry Andruschak! 

<p>
2) Rule interpretation question..... now that Kenny has NOT been
killed and has crossed the final finish line and left the course,
can a NEW rider break away from the current pack?? 
My interpretation is YES.  
It could not have happened THIS turn, but it CAN happen next turn.
Keep that in mind as you maneuver toward the finish.

<p>

(STOOGES - GM): I think we'll call this on the one that got away.  Doesn't
pay to get distracted.  I'm not sure what I could have done, but there had
to have been something better than this!

<p>
(DESIGNER - ALL): Remember the winner of this race gets a free copy of the face 
to face version of Breaking Away.  Obviously it would be no fun at all were I 
to win the prize, which is why my play has been so crap in this game....

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO. QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO.,
INC.):  Profits off $22M last quarter, only slightly written off with a minor
acquisition.  Staff continues to be cut.  We don't believe that the riders
have yet noticed that the chase vehicle was sold at auction and the music
coming through their earpieces is on a continuous loop of Barry Manilow's
Greatest Hits.  The crystal ball reader was let go and replaced with the
CEO's 7-year-old niece, who is calling the shots using the tried-and-true
method of inviting all her beanie babies to a tea party and discussing it
with them.  We don't believe that we've ever had board meetings go this well
before.

<p>
(MOPSY-FIELD:)  Hop.

<p>
(BUNNIES-CHEF:)  It's time for us to make a final desperate move.  
We don't want to wind up in the stew pot!

<p>
(MOPSY-FIELD:)  Hop, hop.

<p>
(INVESTMENT BANKING COMMUNITY-GOZ):  What you need to do is book a large
non-recurring loss that actually includes most of your ongoing expenses, report
a substantial improvement in ``operating profit", and change your team name to
``goz.com''.  If you can see your way clear to making these small improvements
in your business model, we will supply all the funds you may require.

<p>
(MOPSY-FIELD:)  Hop, hop, hop.

<p>
(OPINION):  There's no stopping Chef's Crackers.

<p>
(MOPSY-FIELD:)  Hop, hop, hop, hop.

<p>
(GOZ to EVERYONE ELSE):  Hello?  Am I talking to myself out here again?

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): Whole lotta barkin' goin' on.....

<p>
(DAMON to BARKIN'):  Uh, you did play the `3' this time, didn't you?
<i>((Yes, otherwise, you guys would have been stuck with the permanent
threes.
Now, he can play both fours, get ahead of you, and then you can get some
fours, and so on.....))</i>

<p>
(GOZ SECOND OBSERVATION ON THE ``BREAKAWAY'' RULE):  Kenny would have had a 45
this time.  By the time the 8th rider crosses the line he'd be at warp
speed.  Then he'd never be killed, as he'd be in a time-warp.

<p>
(GAME DESIGNER OPINES):
As you probably know, Scotsman John Logie-Baird invented the television and 
yet Britain probably has the smallest range of TV channels of any of the major 
nations of the world. Furthermore, nobody makes televisions in Britain 
anymore.  Strange that, isn't it?
<i>((Interesting, I grew up in Schenectady, NY, where General Electric got
its start and grew up with the propaganda that some GE scientists invented
TV......))</i>

<p>
(SOUTH PARK GAZETTE):

<p>
International News:
<i>Green Cards Revoked!</i>
In a strange turn of events, the South Park Bureau of the
U.S. State Department revoked the travel visas of all visitors
from Britain.  In a strange twist, the spokesman, Mrs. Broslofski
stated ``especially those British visitors who have been dead for over
100 years! They're stinking up the streets, though we don't really
mind if that theater guy Bill sticks around, he seems harmless."

<p>
Local News:
<i>Round Wheels Donated!</i>
Having heard the plight of the sorrowful ``Flat Wheel Society,"
the South Park Elementary School, under the organization the 
chef from its cafeteria, named Chef, has started a tire drive. 
``Round
Wheels for the Flat Wheel Society"!  When asked about this sudden
concern for a team which had been neglected throughout the race,
Chef broke into a version of ``Little Red Corvette".  The relevance
escaped this reporter, who agrees that ``if it's Saturday night, I
guess that makes it all right".  

<p>
Drama section:
<i>Accident at Theater leaves cast scrambling</i>
Last night at the South Park theater, an accident occurred during
rehearsal for the visiting Broadway Show ``Five Guys named Moe".
A 40-lb sandbag fell from the rafters, seriously injuring one of the
Moes.  A small child in a large winter coat was seen running from
the theater, but no identification was possible, since his winter
coat was zipped up halfway across his face.  Said Mr. Garrison, 
local host for the visiting troupe, ``Well, this really sucks, we
need five guys named Moe, and we only have four!  Where can we
find another one?"  When asked whether some other actor not named
Moe could step in, Mr. Garrison developed a puzzled expression and
said, ``But the name is `Five Guys named Moe', not `Four Guys named
Moe and One Guy pretending to be named Moe'"  

<p>
Classsifieds:
<i>Little Bunny Fufu, where are you?</i>
Female bunny sought for fun and excitement.  Please report to
100 mile marker at the bike race.  Lots of interesting male bunnies
should be coming by soon!  If you could perhaps distract one or two,
the citizens of South Park will be tremendously grateful!

<p>
Food Section:
<i>Chef Whines</i>
Dammit!  The South Park Movie was gone from the US theaters by
the time I got back for a visit.  And sure, it's #1 in England
<i>now</i> but it wasn't out yet when I was there in July.  Guess I've
got to see it in Germany.  ``O Mein Gott!  Du hast 
Kenny umgebracht!  Du Bastard!"  Good news, the RTL network
will start showing the programs here in a few weeks.  But 
all my references will still be mostly from Season 1 for quite a
while (probably until the end of this race.)

<p>
Movie Reviews:
<i>Blair Which?</i>
Got really scared for a viewing of the overhyped Blair Witch
Project.  Have to agree with former Kid on the Hall Scott Thompson,
who said that Canadians are more used to camping and would not
have gotten so scared at what was probably just a raccoon.  

<p>
This reviewer's theory is that the ``witch" was just our beloved
Scuzzlebutt, having fun with a few crazy teenagers.  The
wicker baskets and the Patrick Duffy voices you can hear in the
background give it away.

<p>
Public Enemy said it best:  Don't Believe the Hype!

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Fear and whiskey, I hold you tight.''
From ``Fear and Whiskey'' of the album of the same name.

<p>
(UKRAINE - TURKEY): We enjoyed our jousting with your fine soldiers and
diplomats.  Thank you for a most entertaining time.  Please do come again,
and rest assured that we will value and cherish your cultural treasures.
Excuse us now, got to run and cherish a few houris!

<p>
(UKRAINE - RUSSIA): Well, you can take some consolation in the thought that
your demise will be yet another shining example of international cooperation,
continuing that fine tradition of sharing that began in Turkey.

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to LESSER BEINGS (ALL OTHERS)):  So you think that
we are the largest and most threatening entity that you have witnessed
in a while?
Huh!  Our Austrian brethren in the Colonia VII game ``Home Office" just
built
seven, bringing them to the total of 23 units on the board (a bit less
than half of the
winning total for that variant!).  They are now roughly tied with the
Netherlands,
Ottomans, French and Chinese; most of the little guys are gone and the
``great war"
looms....

<p>
(BERLIN to ROMA): Our dots in the hand are worth twice more than yours in
the
bush.  This turn is for manouvering; the next brings you to your knees.

<p>
(HAMBURG to I/U/E): So what do you have planned for all those units in
Turkey?

<p>
(ROME-LONDON): Join us against the Dark Side!  It is not only your moral
obligation but it will also be the most fun thing to do.  The Evil
Professor cannot stand up to all of us united-he would melt like the
wicked witch he is.

<p>
(FRANKFURT to CAIRO): A fleet on the Red Sea?  We're SCARED!

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): I hope you didn't forget, because by rule I cannot cut support 
against an attack against myself, but you can blow it away.
<i>((He didn't forget, you made it!!))</i>

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to S/E): Nien, dummkopf, nien!  If stabbing our
British
brothers is tantamount to inviting your forces into England, we must
demur....  Stay
in your cages like good morons, and allow us to go about our business as
we see fit.

<p>
(KIEV): The Ukranian government announced today the first stages of the
construction of the great Ukranian wall.  A shining example of modern
military triumph, in the tradition of the Maginot Line and the Great Wall
of China, this fortified pipeline will run from the Adriatic Sea to the
Caspian.  Filled with the smoke from only the finest exports from the
new Turkish provinces, the high pressure spigots will be capable of
``knocking whole armies silly in seconds".  Ukranian soldiers are undergoing
intensive training to build up their immunities through steadily increasing
doses.  Tourists are warned that this is a military installation and that
someone within a hundred yards of them is liable to be shot if they wander
into a restricted area.

<p>
1) New proposals include a Russian concession, a RBHJ draw, and a HBRJ draw.
Hey, those last two are the same, aren't they?
Well, anyway, vote on them with your Summer orders.
Failure to vote vetoes the proposals as usual.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(H - GM):  Hey, we had no press at all last time,
doesn't that mean the game is over?

<p>
(BOOB to DUTCH FACE): Yeah, but I wrote NONE in there to save you.....

<p>
(RUSSIA to JAPAN):  Domo arigato ... unless you happen to be only the
latest and greatest lying rat bastard to get into this game for the sole
purpose of Tsar-bashing.  (Wot?  Me paranoid?)  Seriously, we wish you
well Ozog-san, and have graciously supported you as asked.
<i>((A worm seems to have turned....))</i>

<p>
(TSAR to BRIT): I tire of all this thrashing around in the center ...
prepare to meet the true might of the Russian bear!  I can not maintain
a line from Egypt to Irkutsk, and so must shift to face the direst
enemy.  You, my friend, shall reel from the Cossack sabre stroke. 
Forward lads, for Romanov, Righteousness, and Russia!!!
<i>((First thrusts seem quite effective.....))</i>

<p>
(TURKEY): Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

<p>
(TSAR - SULTAN): Wake up, Terry.  There's a war on.  You're still in it.

<p>
(BOOB to TOADFATHER): If you weren't the great Toadfather, I'd probably
kick your butt right out of this game.....

<p>
(JAPAN - ALL): Sorry for the lack of negotiations. 
I will be switching career paths after next week so it's been kind of hectic.
I will try and contact you all as soon as I can. 

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): Louie, Louie, oh no ... yeah, we got to go,
yeah-yeah-yeah ... hang on, Louie, Louie hang on.  Russian forces are on
their way to support you against the vile (not to mention unsavory)
alliance of the Sinister Dutch Uncle (SDU) and the Foppish English Dandy
(FED).  As neither culture ever cooked a meal we'd care to eat, let's
win this one for the wine, cheese and pastries you are sooooo
delightfully good at.

<p>
(FRANCE): Just vote YES.
<i>((To holding on to Canton???
Nay, nay, you didn't take the right vote....))</i>

<p>
(H - F): J'accuse!

<p>
(LORD TSAR OF THE RUSSIAS to JAVAMAN): I am going to blast those stinking
fleets of yours into the next hemisphere, my Dutch Uncle, just as soon
as I figure out how to exit the stinking Mediterranean.
<i>((You advanced one more place this turn, almost there....
he's coming to meet you from the South!))</i>

<p>
(MOSCOW to BORNEO): By the way, Javabutt, my dearest friend, the Emperor
God-King of Japan Kurtukawa Ozogsan, who as you know recently ascended
the Throne of the Empire of the Rising Sun after the timely (and
hopefully painful) passing of kidney stones forced Lukey-luke Dwyersan
into early retirement, has asked me to inform you of his intent to mash
you lie an overripe grape and to force you back into those smelly little
rainforests from which you, millipede-like, have slithered.

<p>
(H(awkeye?) - BJ): Empty mailboxes make me sad.
I'm going to go eat some honey.  (Yes, 
Pooh is running things now, Kenny and the kids
are still at the bike race.)

<p>
(ODESSAPHILE to GM-SKI): Could you send a massive spring flood into the
area and help us clean out the rabble in the streets?  We're overrun
with old appartchiks, bureaucrats, old KGB agents and retired
over-stuffed generals, (not to mention has-been chess champions) here in
beautiful downtown Odessa, and are due for a thorough spring cleaning. 
Thanks.
<i>((You have now given up complete control of the Railroad.
Enjoy.....))</i>

<p>
(CROWN OF RUSSIA to CROWN OF ENGLAND): Where are the crowns?  Send in the
crowns ... but seriously, ahem.  I will run you from the continents of
Africa, Europe and Asia if you insist on this unprovoked war of
conquest, imperial slavery and colonial hegemony.  Talk to me.

<p>
(H - COLUMBUS CHILL): Don't go!! Then we'll be at
the back of the 'zine!  
<i>((Sorry, they're gone!!
Gee, first time in a dog's age I haven't had an orphan game taking up the rear.
Perhaps Michael will change that.... and that's all, folks!!!))</i>
