<br /><br />We're horribly late again, I was off to Oslo, Norway for a business trip and I hoped
to get the szine out before I left, but you know how that went.  
Also, I'm having some trouble updating the web site fully (the index page) but I will
fix that this week somehow.
I'm hoping Millis Miller (thanks, Millis, for all you dO!!!) will fix things so I can
do it the way I did it before, but I might have to improvise.
We've got a <i>Tinamou</i> in here from David Partridge, and I pushed the deadlines
back a couple of weeks to accomodate the delay.  I still want the 300th issue to be
my first issue in January, 2006.
Have a great Thanksgiving everyone (I guess I need to say, only to the Americans!).

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:

 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date was now a "whenever".
But Peter is now clearly back!!!
See <i>Octopus' Garden</i> in the print edition below, or on the web
at the above address.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge have been picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.
Rip has been traveling this summer also, but he is trying to get his act back
together soon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR KEVIN TIGHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a very special "search for" coming up in issue #300, and I'm
going to offer a hundred buck reward for that one, so I'm also going to 
up the ante on Kevin through issue #300 to $1 billion dollars.... no,
make that $100, can't quite afford to be THAT generous.
There have been some recent "sightings" of Kevin Tighe.
And he's the reason I first started this feature (for those of you who
don't recall) and he's the one I continue to be most interested in finding.
This may take a bit of real detective work, but as a hint, like many of
us Diplomacy players, I believe he is out there making money on some
of the poker circuits.
I also would like ALL of the previous found people who are still getting
the szine to write me SOMETHING for the 300th issue for this section.
I know I've been having Doug Beyerlein write me lots of little notes
along the way, not all of whom I've been printing, and so I have some
things from him already.
But he may want to send me something else.
What should you write?
Something on what you've been up to, a reminiscence of Diplomacy times
or friends past, whatever, it's up to you, but I want something from
as many of you as possible.
While we're at it, some of you other old timers still getting the
szine (you know who you are, but I'm thinking most particularly of
people like Tom Nash, Dan Stafford, Bruce Geryk, and Steve Hutton,
most of whom were once szine editors) also should write me something!!!
I plan to have issue #300 be the first issue of 2006, so you have the
rest of the year.
I'll save them up for that issue, but get writing now!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:

WorldMasters 2002 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals are over, and 
in a game that went to 1914 (nice idea here to let the finals go
on for longer, a feature of WorldMasters that I applaud) Julio
Pereira gets to 14 centers as Russia and TAKES the 2002 WorldMasters
Tournament.
Congratulations to Julio, and salutes and felicitations to the
growing impact of the Brazilians in the Diplomacy hobby.
Julio is a fierce player and a good guy to boot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
for details on that, the Round 2 draws are out and games are going.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let me repeat what I said last time....
Some of the notable matchups include the WM04R221 draw that includes
Lee Harmon (G), Andy Bartalone (E), and Glenn Ledder (F).
I don't think I could come up with three more diverse personalities
who are all great players!  That will be quite a battle.
Glenn Ledder also is in the feature gutsy3 game that you can
observe in process by joining the gutsy3 observers group on Yahoo.
Guess what happened???
I got called in as a STANDBY for Turkey in this game!!!
Now I'm negotiating with Lee-Man, Buffalo, and Polymath Glenn.
Dan, Urco, and Ian round out the players.
This is fun, let's see if I can shake the game up a bit.
More on that as the game develops.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
But most of the talk there has been about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson
and Tony Dickinson, among others!).  
This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really
is quite comprehensive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This game is out and available.
You all should read the interview in the Spring 2005 movement issue
of the <i>Diplomatic Pouch</i> that you can find at: 
http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S2005M/

<div class="p"><!----></div>

more info or if you want demos or help with a Diplomacy convention!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To find out more general information on DIPLOMACY please visit
www.diplomacy-pcgame.com or contact pr of paradoxplaza.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There has been a firestorm of interest in this, both HEAVILY pro and
HEAVILY con.  But I stand by what I said last time, Paradox is going
to pay attention and make improvements and have staying power, I think.
But if you want to see the REALLY negative, check out GameSpy's review
(their "lowest rated game review" ever) at:
http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/diplomacy-2005/665958p1.html
but remember, that really just indicates degree of difficulty, this game
is REALLY, REALLY hard.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If one does buy it, I strongly recommend reviewing 
the detailed web comments on their web
site and downloading the errata files before starting to try it.
Paradox indicates its intent to actually listen and support
the product (meaning at the least that they will fix errors).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 e.g. see http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/announcement.php?f=295

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BUT, the question is, what will Paradox do to fix and improve things? 
I think they will do what it takes.
But in any case, their main point is not going to compete well
with the Pouch/Judges/Human adjudicators, but to provide their
own different experience.  They may ultimately do that well,
but haven't yet.

Jim,
I'm looking at putting together a Diplomacy tournament here in the
Lafayette, IN area sometime early in 2006 (date isn't sent yet). 2
questions-

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1. Do you know of players, groups, etc. in this area (Lafayette is between
Chicago and Indianapolis) who would be interested, or others who might
travel for one?
<i>((Jim O'Kelley and Russ Rusnak can tell you about their Chicago area
get togethers.
Jim's crowd has had a recent get-together, plans another one in January,
and has a Yahoo Group, http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/ChicagoDip
Others?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2. Would you be willing to put a thing in <i>TAP</i> and/or <i>Diplomacy World</i> 
once I get more details?
<i>((But of course...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've got a local coffeehouse interested in hosting, and 
Purdue University is
nearby, so there should be some prospects locally, too.

Time to start making your plans to attend the 2006 North American 
Diplomacy Championships, held February 24-26, 2006 in conjunction with 
Prezcon in Charlottesville, VA.  The Diplomacy tournament will be run by 
David Hood using the Dixiecon/Prezcon system that has been utilized in 
several past Dipcons.  There will be four Diplomacy rounds beginning on 
Friday night, with no time limits except for the Sunday round.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dipcon is always a highlight of the Diplomacy circuit for the year - get 
more information now at www.prezcon.com and www.dixiecon.com or you can 
email the tournament director at davidhood of dixiecon.com for specific 
information.  The Prezcon folks are committed to making this a very 
special Dipcon, with a specific Dipcon registration fee and T-shirt, so 
check out their site for more information.  The Dipcon committee of 
David Hood, Michael Lowrey and Andy Marshall has many years of Diplomacy 
tournament direction experience between them, so screw-ups are extremely 
unlikely.  And Director of Fun Andy Marshall has guaranteed you WILL 
have fun at this Dipcon, or your money back.

Hard to decide who I want to win, since I had called an Angels/Cards
WS.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Case in favor of the White Sox: they haven't won since 1917, it's a
story similar to Boston's, their manager is nutty, they don't have
Roger Clemens, it would be nice for Frank Thomas to get a ring, Tom
DeLay isn't from Chicago, somebody in Houston stole my jean

Case in favor of Houston: they've never won a WS, it'd be nice for

Tom DeLay has already been indicted, the White Sox deserve their
curse because they <i>threw</i> a World Series, it's too late to punish

insist on singularizing here) with similar tenure is Thomas, and he
won't even be playing.

For now, I'm just loving the former Yankee angle.

<i>((I'm sticking by my White Sox to sweep model.  I think the most
interesting aspect of the managerial decisions to be made is 
on the DH choice by the Astros.  The sentimental choice would
be to put Jeff Bagwell on the roster (he MIGHT be left off it,
but I think they WON'T be able to bring themselves to do that)
and make him the DH in Chicago.  That would be sentimental,
and dumb.  And an indication of how cutthroat the Astros intend
to be to try to win this (i.e. are they just happy to be here,
or do they intend to go all out to win).  My heartless self
would leave Bagwell on the sidelines and off the roster.
In other words, I totally disagree with Rick.  This is about
scoring runs and preventing runs.  I KNOW that crazy like a fox
White Sox will be heartless, and that will be the heart they
need to win.
So says the Jim-Bob!))</i>

Bagwell was on the roster for both series thus far.  I think there's
zero chance that he won't be on for the WS.  He's already pinch-hit
twice, and knocked in a run in the LDS.  He'd probably be quite happy
to serve as the DH in Chicago.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As I understand it, his injury does not affect his hitting at all,
but only his throwing.  If true, he's tailor-made for the DH
position.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The idea of keeping him off the roster entirely is unthinkable.  He's
earned the right to play in the World Series.

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Fri, 21 Oct 2005 08:42:03 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gentlemen,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So I've been pondering the upcoming World Series...well...ever since the
last one, and trying to make sense out of it.  The fact that we've got a
team in it who's never been in one before against a team who hasn't won
a World Series since the last time they THREW a World Series kinda makes
looking at it in a historical context futile.  I'd like to take the easy
way out (and I'm surprised Jim-Bob didn't think of this first) and say
that, since the Red Sox won the WS last year there must be something
special about the year 1961 (stay with me on this).  That was 43 years
after the Red Sox won their previous WS, and 43 years before they'd win
their next.  Coincidentally (or not), it's now been 44 years since that
year, when it was 44 years after the White Sox won THEIR last WS.  If we
extrapolate this further, note that 1961 was 53 years after the Cubs
last won the WS, and it would put them on pace to win again in 2014.  I
can hardly wait.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hmmm, maybe I'll try logic instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I keep hearing about starting pitching staffs.  I don't buy into that
much, because the White Sox will at most face Oswalt only in Game 3 and
Game 7, so how many games can he really win?  Alright, we watched Randy
Johnson go the extra mile in 2001, and Clemens do a good relief job in
this year's NLDS, but in the end it's going to be Clemens against
Contrearas, Pettitte against Buerhle, Oswalt against Garland, Bakke
against Garcia and then repeat.  So for Game 1 (and 5) I call it a push,
give a slight edge to Houston for Game 2 and 3 (and 6 and 7), and give a
big edge to Chicago for Game 4.  Is that enough to tip things in
Houston's favor?  Um, I don't know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Relief pitching gives a slight edge to Houston.  Lidge over Jenks?  Of
course.  Middle relief might go to the Sox, but barely.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Position players, both offense and defense, goes to Chicago.  Both teams
will manufacture runs, but Chicago will get theirs' easier.  Both
defenses are tight.  Houston will have more highlight material, but
Chicago's is sounder overall.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not sure where to put the advantage for the bench.  My gut says
Astros, but, as Jim-Bob and Rick suggested, how will the DH or
lack-thereof figure into that?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, who is hotter?  The White Sox, despite being called "dead" in
mid-September, have won 12 of their last 13 games.  Houston has merely
been very, very solid getting through the pack of contenders into the
Wild Card slot, then beating a tough Atlanta club followed by a wounded
Cardinal club.  The White Sox are streakier, but of course that can cut
both ways.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So this brings us to the managers.  Hmmm.  Garner has really never
impressed me...until this year.  Funny how making the World Series
changes your perspective on that.  Ozzie is, hands down, the most
exiting manager in MLB today (Chinese curse:  May you live in
interesting times.).  In what seems likely to be a tight, low-scoring
series, I'd expect a lot of moves by both.  Look for Ozzie's to be more
frequent, and more puzzling.  I'd have to bet that he makes 3 calls that
will decide games that look really strange at the times he makes them.
But how many of those 3 work out?  Hmm...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My analysis on the better team:  Uh, I have no clue.  None.  Not even a
bluff.  Not that that little detail will keep me from making predictions
(were you guys worried about that?)...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note:  the weather for the first two games is supposed to be very
un-baseball like.  We're due for highs in the low 50's, with temps
dropping to mid-40s for both Saturday and Sunday game-time, and rain
possible both days (someone actually said the "s-" word as a possibilty
for Sunday night).  While I have opinions about the weather as well,
I'll leave the predictions for that to others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think that the White Sox win a sloppy Game 1.  Neither starter looks
sharp, and Chicago gets about an 8-6 win.  After that, just when all the
commentators are giving their "mea culpas" about how wrong they were
about it being a low-scoring Series, it becomes a low-scoring Series.
Houston gets Game 2 about 2-1, and then heads home for a good outing by
Oswalt.  Garcia picks up the Sox in Game 4, and commentators start
making noises about "the Best World Series ever".  So Clemens dispatches
Contrearas in a blowout Game 5 at that point.  The Series returns to
Chicago, where the lice, frogs and locusts have taken over.  Buerhle
outduels Pettitte in a 1-0 classic Game 6, and, just as all the
commentators have said that Houston can't possibly recover from that any
better than they said the Astros could recover from their NLCS Game 5
meltdown, Oswalt gives up 1 run on 3 hits over 8 innings and Lidge
closes out a 3-1 Game 7.  The lice, frogs and locusts board the next
train to Houston, and Astros' fans start hiding their firstborn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Having just re-read the above, I really can't shoot any holes in it, or
come up with anything smarter.  Feel free to try.  I'm just gonna sit
back and watch, and hopefully see some good baseball.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Without citing everything, I agree with the implied sentiment that
Oswalt is the best pitcher in the Series, and the team with the best
pitcher usually has the advantage if their other pitchers are at
least half-decent.  Houston's are better than that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't think Bobby Jenks is at the level of Lidge, Rivera, or
Foulke.  At some point, that probably will hurt the White Sox.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm almost picking the Astros to win, it seems, but I think I want to
simply sit back and enjoy the series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Since Rick left a few of the easy predictions for 2006 out, here's my
take:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob will predict the Red Sox to win the World Series.  He will tell
us no fewer than 4 times how the Yankees won't even make the playoffs.
He will say that Ken Griffey, Jr. will have a great season and help the
Reds to the playoffs.  He will laud Barry Bonds and pick the Giants to
win the NL West and make it at least to the NLCS, with Barry being NL
MVP and hitting 75 home runs.  He will somehow rationalize that the
financial system under which MLB plays is "fair".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Did I leave anything out?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No, but you're really being rather inaccurate on purpose.
My big thing on both the Yankees and Braves is that they make the
playoffs but don't do anything once they get there.
I agree with Rick's early 2006 prediction, but would add that neither
the Braves nor the Yankees will win their first round playoff series.
On Griffey, Jr., he did JUST what I thought he would do this year,
but that was lots more than many people thought.
I never said, nor thought, that Griffey, Jr. would lead the Reds to
the playoffs.
I WILL laud the Barry and you have most of the rest right, though I think
about 50 homers is all we'll get out of Bonds but that will put him in 
Aaron country at the end of the year.
And the financial system in MLB <b>IS</b> fair, it just isn't balanced.
And while I might like to see balanced, we've got to figure out a way
to design it AND a way to get us from here to there.
I am not optimistic about this.))</i>

Note:  the best team in baseball won the World Series last night.
Emphasis very heavy on "team".  My wife, who is a White Sox fan but not

that the Sox have a different hero every game.  I'm amending that to, "a
different hero every inning".  Last night it was Uribe in the 9th, Dye
in the 8th, etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They hit and pitch just well enough to win...and win and win.  I salute
them and call them "my Daddy".

Pete,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm curious if you have a reaction yet to the whole foofaraw in Dodgers 
land.  In Athletics Nation the buzz is overwhelmingly pro-DePo.  For 
some reason there's still loyalty to him, so the general attitude is 
McCourt is a jerk and DePo got screwed.  A subtheme - which I'm 
inclined to agree with - is that while DePo had some things in common 
with Beane, one thing he lacked was Billy's people skills and ability 
to schmooze and charm anyone, and that's what got DePo fired.  He had 
way too many enemies in LA to just trust his job was secure and after a 
losing season they all caught up with him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another subtheme is that the Dodgers are now perceived as likely 
trading partners. Apparently the organization has several young guys 
that we like, but they're the same guys that DePo would like. With DePo 
gone, the new guy might not value them as much so perhaps we could get 
a deal.  Among the known names, the one who gets mentioned the most is 
Hee-Seop Choi.  I don't know much about him, but apparently Billy has 
liked him in the past and he's now seen as possible DH-plus-backup-1B 
to replace Hatteberg.  The other thing I'm hearing now is that the 
Dodgers would be a good destination for Zito if we trade him.  Before 
this, the talk was all about the Mets.  Zito would be a personal good 
fit in LA, and about a year ago I remember predicting Dodgers as the 
most likely ultimate destination for him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The talk about Choi points up the fact that the A's, in spite of being 
an AL team, haven't really had a true DH type hitter in years.  Seems 
like the commonest pattern for DH is either big slugger who comes with 
a high salary, or a veteran who had mediocre defense to begin with and 
now doesn't play in the field at all.  The former are too expensive for 
us; the latter we sometimes have in their younger days but he moves on 
before he reaches the DH phase of his career (eg, Giambi).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of the A's games this past season was the first time in baseball 
history both teams batted their DH ninth.  A's had done that several 
times this year.  As often as not our DH is one of the second-rank guys 
on the bench anyway.  When we do have a DH, the pattern seems to be to 
get a AAAA type player who hits well enough that he could be a 
big-leaguer if he had good defense, but his defense isn't good enough 
to put him in the field, and his hitting isn't good enough to warrant a 
DH spot.  I gather that Choi is in that category, but near the top 
within the category.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Re Zito:  For what it's worth, my current is that it's about 50-50 he's 
with the team for 2006.  Beane is saying he's not interested in trading 
Zito, but I think that's just to push the price up.  If he gets a good 
offer, he'll give up Zito; if he doesn't, he won't.  The question is 
what the demand will be for a good starting pitcher.  It's possible 
that there'll be a backlash against the widespread overpricing of 
starting pitching last year.  If that's the case, you might even see 
Beane go out and buy a few.

If I read the tea leaves right, I think that Theo Epstein might even
end up switching careers and NOT be a GM any more.  That would
be my guess right now.
This was a real mess.
As far as we can tell, what happened was this (some informed
speculation built in):
Theo and Larry Lucchino should really have gotten the deal done in the
spring, and all parties agree that they probably could have done it then.
They didn't want Theo getting an agent (policy for management level 
contracts), so during the season everyone was too busy to get it done.
Then after the season, first Lucchino stretched the negotiations out
by starting them at a lower number than he probably "should have",
but then the discussion came around to respect and controlling the 
discussions with the media.
Theo was upset that he and Larry weren't speaking to the media with the
same voice, and ditto for the other senior management.
Theo had "his guys under control" but Larry didn't have Charles Steinberg
(his guy) under control.
And weirdly, Charles was the guy who FIRST discovered Theo as an intern.
So they reached a deal in principal on a Thursday/Friday.
Then, as a signal for the new regime, Theo and Larry held joint 
conference calls with writers to "leak" the news of a deal.
This was so weird in this world (not in mine, but in theirs)
that at least one writer on a talk show said he'd never been
in such a thing before.  Writers usually try to talk to both
sides separately!
But then, and this is my speculation, Charles Steinberg also
talked to at least one writer.  
And Theo killed the deal on Monday, perhaps because he saw he
never was going to really control the organization and the structure.
Maybe it was something else.
But everyone keeps talking about "what if Theo just comes back"
like Ken Macha came back in Oakland.
Could still happen, otherwise it looks like we're going to get

Carmelita. This time I will have a digital camera and should get a lot of
photos to pick and choose between. Last time I was disappointed in the
quality, especially after scanning.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The hurricane hit some of my favorite places hard. Places like Isla
Mujeres have good shelters and I suspect that Cancun does as well. I still
haven't heard about Punta Allen; the people I know there were in Michigan at
the time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In early March, 2007, I plan to again head to Mexico and buy a bike, but
this time I will bus to places like Xpujil to see some Rio Bec sites and a
few other odd ones there. Bikes go under the bus. Given time, I will go
somewhere else for other ruins. Maybe it will be in the Puuc hills to do day
trips to see obscure ruins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the end, I plan to swim, paddle and maybe fish in Punta Allen. I can't
think of a lovelier place to "rest up" after a ruins trip. Maybe you would
want to think about going on this one too. I plan to sell the bike either in
Punta Allen like last time or maybe in Playa del Carmen.

Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.
Rip has been a bit missing in action lately, but I am assured that he
SHALL return.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm ready to start a new Breaking Away game, who's interested???
Challenge David Partridge again as he is in, so are 
Brendan Whyte and Alexander Woo.
Anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game if there is enough interest!!!
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.
We have Karl Schmit and Sean O'Donnell on the list, let's get seven!!
It's FREE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly or you can look at them at
www.variantbank.org.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'll try to remember to punch in the rules in the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??

I'M TRYING TO TAKE OVER Phil Reynolds' two regular Diplomacy games somewhere in <i>TAP</i>.
One is going to Harold Reynolds' subszine, since Colonia is over and I'll take the other.
I am calling for orders from everyone NOW, and whichever game looks easier to start I
will give to Harold, but I'm getting no response.
Should we just shut these down??
I have Phil's last issue, #44, but that was published way back in December of 
2003.
I'm not sure if people have moved or whatever in that time, so a little help would
be appreciated.
And I hope everyone comes back, but I might need some standbys. 
I'm going to start nagging so I can get these restarted.
Please let me know if you care playing, thanks to Karl Schmit for responding
each time that he's in....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England), 
John Power (Germany), Tim Snyder (Italy), and Fred Wiedemeyer (Russia)
are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.
Paul Risner probably is not going to be able to continue in the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can find that last issue of Phil's szine at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Call for orders is NOW, the next season after the results above.
You should already have submitted these before.
Then I'll give one of the games to Harold.
I'm not getting any traction or writebacks on these games, does everyone just
want to abandon them???

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The game is a whole lot smaller now, thanks to Don and Sean for playing.
Sean sent his end game statement now, so I'm going to print it now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOOB): I won't be into depth/detail because it's not exactly written in 
stone yet, but I do some writing on the wall, but if you you're thinking 
what I think you are especially with the note you've left me. I'd say your 
on target. Time will tell mostly because it isn't written in stone. Pretty 
much I feel like I'm playing a new version of Diplomacy without a map to 
look at to help guide my decisions. A little irony there isn't it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): Yes, but this is real life, good luck working your way through it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIAN END OF GAME STATEMENT WHILE IT'S FRESH IN MY MIND): 
Well I came into this game trying to figure out how best to win. My first 
thoughts was establishing a R/T alliance though the Turkish response was a 
A/T/R alliance which got me rather suspicious, so I decided to check out 
what other players may be planning, and I wanted to know if any of them 
matched. France offered a three way alliance against Germany, and I couldn't 
turn that down especially since it would bring me within borders with my 
dear uncle, whom I very much like to out play in Diplomacy whether it be out 
survive or most likely see which one of us stabs the other first as we have 
many times at family gathering Diplomacy games that we been kicking up 
almost a year back, but a few things gotten in the way there, but anywho, it 
didn't go anywhere near as I had planned because England decided not risking 
being in the middle of apparently dubbing it an O'Donnell Juggernaut. I did 
speak to dear old Uncle Jeffy Pooh about this, and he openly said something 
to the effect of "So, much for using England to invade Russia because Russia 
sucks." I could have died laughing because I also had plans on talking to 
England about invading Russia at the near elimination of Germany figuring 
one step at a time.-Thanks England you made my only reason for allying 
against Germany in the first place pointless, just thought I should mention 
it. Jeff maybe next game- To top it off I got over concentrated with England 
to get him to halt the invasion allowing my though I had thought I/T/A would 
just deal with eachother or hopes so at any rate. A/T decided to get what 
they could outta me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd say overall nothing worked. I definitely didn't want R/T/A for this 
particular game, and I didn't try keeping that front as secure as I could 
have, and again England used a hose to put out my candle. Overall I'd say 
France may suck, but I must say Russia sucks more for this one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While I'm doing this, as my last order aside from the retreat. I've 
order all the cathouses to entertain the German troops in Warsaw while 
buying all the alccy's, so I could get devastatingly drunk though the rest 
is for the troops in Warsaw though I'm sorry but the English and Austria and 
Turkey already drank the rest of it unless you like home brewed beer and 
wine. The liquor I killed off.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To Italy, I would like to thank you for making it possible for me not 
to be the first player eliminated from the game. Thank you very much. I'd 
send you booze, but alas it's in the occupiers hands.

2) A very warm thanks to Mark Kinney for playing out the English position in a 
bad situation.
I really appreciate it.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.
This proviso will be in place at least until the Fall turn.
At that point, we'll see if anything substantial actually changes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Thanks to Eric Brosius for playing this position for awhile,
but as he says, he does NOT have time to play an active position
and it looks like this position has become more active.
Thanks in advance to Dan Gorham for stepping in.
