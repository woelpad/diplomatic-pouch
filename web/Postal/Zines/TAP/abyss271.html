<br /><br />I've got subszines in here from Rip Gooch and Harold Reynolds.
Harold finally has a Colonia map that I think everyone can follow.
This is tremendous, watch the game!!
Wait!!!  Hold the presses, we DO have <i>Tinamou</i> coming in,
let's see, is that it??
Yes, there it is, let's go with THREE subszines then.
Lots of good reading, probably more in the subszines than
in the main szine this time around.
Thanks to all of you for making this so easy.

<br /><br />Last chance to join me at the "Boston Massacre" tournament in Boston at MIT
on June 21-22, 2003.
Show up and have a blast with a great bunch of FTF Dip players.....
Dave Partridge made a great web site with all sorts of info at
http://diplom.org/BostonMassacre/
It looks like we will have at least 50 players, but we have to get up to 69
in order to get me onto the tournament rankings, as I own 69th place.
So where are you guys???
I count only four <i>TAP</i>ites coming so far.
Do I have to threaten to fold again??? 
We had a great little warm up at Mel's house on Sunday, we taught a few FTF
newbies how to do it, so they would have a chance in the tournament.
Well, so they wouldn't get killed TOO fast anyway.
It was hard to convince them that they couldn't just SIT THERE!
They had to get up and negotiate.
We also got a preview of the prizes, which are way cool.
You have to join us!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Lots of great music stuff coming out!
Ghod (Richard Thompson) has a new record coming out and so does Erin McKeown.
And moreover, magic of magic, they are appearing together for a minitour
from June 30-July 6 in the UK.
Said tour will pass through Northampton, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham,
and Cardiff.
Anyone attending one of these five concerts and writing a review for TAP
gets an automatic lifetime subscription and will be at my beck and call
for practically anything you want from me.  
I almost dropped everything to go myself, but I can't.
Erin McKeown's new album is called <i>Grand</i> and it is being released 
next week.
The Lady says: "<i>GRAND</i> is my dream of what a record could sound like, 
of what i am interested in as a writer, what i want to be my contribution 
as an artist. you cant ask much more of your latest project."
No, you can't.
I think this record will rock a bit more than her previous intently interior
albums have exhibited.
It surely will be THE record of the year, if Ghod doesn't beat her to it
with <i>The Old Kit Bag</i>, which also is just coming out now.
I've only heard "I'll Tag Along" from it, which continues Ghod's
development of a more complex singing voice.
Anyway, Ghod and the Lady together in one place, you just can't miss it.
Come on, my UK subbers, get out there and REPORT!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> 
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has one opening, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally

<b>THE SEARCH FOR STEVE KNIGHT</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Find Steve Knight by issue 275 and win the fifty buck prize!!
This is a Mykey P. Barno approved search!!!
Steve Knight is famous for getting the first E-Mail game
going that was assigned a Boardman number, back in the early 
1980's.  
Steve Knight started this game in what today would be seen as
a weird way.
He called it "a play-by-mail game of Diplomacy, to be played
over the net."
The game was first advertised in February of 1982 and then
started in March/April 1982 on net.games, the early version of
Usenet.
Mad As Hell, Vol. 1, Issue 1 appeared on the Net on March 26, 1982.
This was around the time that I was starting <i>The Boob Report</i>
that later became this rag.
Steve was the inventor of a number of terms that are still used
on the Internet today.
One was the concept of a "grace period" that recognized that
Internet connections could be squirrely.
The grace period was the time after the deadline that the GM
would wait to receive orders.
Neither Steve nor any of the initial players in the game (A: Don
Holt; E: Eric Anderson; F: Brian Redman; G: Jim Grosch; 
I: Rich Soyack; R: Tim Tjarks; T: Eric Holtman) are currently still
active in the Diplomacy hobby to my knowledge.
But, as you can guess from the name, Tim Tjarks is trivial to find
on the Net and I think I see Rich Soyack.
I'll give you ten bucks for any of them that you get to write me
a letter about the game, and you can offer them at least a few
sample issues.
Steve will get the usual lifetime sub.
Lastly, just to show the way things were on the Internet in those days....
when you sent E-Mail you had to specify the route through various
Gateways with ! points instead of @ signs.  Steve was 
ihnss!ihps3!stolaf!knight (the stolaf was for St. Olaf College
where Steve was at the time) OR harpo!stolaf!knight.  Depending
on where you were and what Gateways you would have to pass through,
it would vary considerably which address would work better for you.
He asked the players to help him figure out what "unpublished uucp
links" might be available to speed up particular connections.
This Gateway structure was maintained until somewhere around 1990,
when the last of the gateways that I know of was folded into the Internet.
I know at the end, the last gateways I had to type were to smaller European
universities (like University of Galway).
I might have more in subsequent issues.
See if you can tell me what happened with the game.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, and Al found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe
or Al Pearson is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WorldMasters 2002 Email Diplomacy Tournament First Round is Nearing the END!!
All first round games need to be finished by the end of June.
Ray Setzer's vicious stabs of everyone in sight succeeded and he took the
18 center win in Fall 1908, with a brilliant guess over Bulgaria where
he supported himself in from Rumania with both Serbia and Budapest.
When Turkey tried A Bul-Rum with two supports, but one of those was
Sev that Ray could and did cut from Ukraine..... well, that did it!
Turkey also had another attack with a support on Bulgaria, but essentially
it was two two-on-three's, neither of which stopped the attack. 
So Ray wins and I think that also puts his team in the lead of the WM Team
Tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.cat23.com/wm02 for full details.  Since I didn't get sufficient
interest to get a team in, I am back on the WorldMasters Tournament Management
Committee again.
Our latest flap was where we (by a very narrow 3-2 margin) voted to 
support a GM who wanted to rollback a season when he forgot a player request for a
deadline extension.
But in general, things seem to be going PRETTY smoothly for a tournament that got
way overwhelmed with 73 teams of 7 players, for a total tournament player roster
of 511!!!
Toby Harris has completed another record first round 18 center victory, gee
I wonder how THAT happened?
And now, I'm facing Toby and others in another "Boasters" game, designed to
hold interest between Rounds 1 and 2 of the WorldMasters Tournament.
I'm Italy to Toby's England and we just can't seem to agree on anything,
I wonder why?

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.

I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.

Sports stuff for TAP:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had meant to tell you earlier this week that there will be a New
Jersey sweep of the NHL and NBA finals.  The Devils are well on their
way.  The Nets have looked very good thus far, and the Spurs seem to
be playing with attention deficit disorder.  I think we'll see that
Kenyon Martin is already good enough to play at least as well as Tim
Duncan.  And the Nets are very polished.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree with you, even though the Devils look in a bit of
trouble at this moment.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I really like the Hillenbrand trade.  The Sox really need another
pitcher, and Kim is immediately their third best pitcher (possibly
second).  Apparently the Jays beat up on Fossum today.  The Sox are
not going to win postseason games with people like Fossum and Burkett
pitching.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((That's for darned sure.... and then Kim's first start is being
rained out as I write and finish up the szine on a Tuesday.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Movie stuff for TAP:  The Italian Job is a nice romp.  The biggest
problem is that the god-awful trailer gives away WAY TOO MUCH.  Why
do Hollywood executives keep doing this to us?  I don't know if I
mentioned the movie Confidence earlier.  A flawed movie certainly -
the movie is told in flashback, and it's hard to see why.  But Dustin
Hoffman is terrific.

If I could rule the movies, I'd put a little flashing red light outside

But that would defeat the whole purpose, wouldn't it??
I'd rather have European style ads instead.

"Wrong Turn" ===  a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wrong Turn" starts out so very well.  It is disturbing, at times disgusting, 
creepy, and very scary.  The idea is that there is a family hidden in the 
wilds of West Virginia that has been inbreeding for centuries.  The results are 
semi-human at best.  They live by trapping cars, killing the occupants, and 
eating them.  Hard to believe that no one notices.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Given the rather absurd premise, these guys are really ugly.  They live like 
bachelors in the very worst sense.  Six young people fall into their trap, and 
start being killed.  When it got down to only two of them left, things got 
even more ridiculous.  But then. the good guys are supposed to win, right?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Still, the first half of the movie was excellent.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I went to see it because of `Buffy the Vampire Slayer'.  Eliza Dushku is a 
semi-regular on the show.  I had to see what she could do in a different 
setting.  Actually it wasn't all that different.  `Jessie' managed to keep her head 
(in both senses) where lesser people were losing theirs (both senses again).  
She is very convincing as a strong willed woman.

"Lizzie McGuire the Movie" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I really was not planning to see "Lizzie McGuire the Movie".
It didn't even make my "if there isn't anything else to watch" list.  
Turns out there wasn't anything else to watch, and a friend told me it was cute.  
Well, it was cute.  There were lots of scenes of Rome in the  background with a 
full head shot of Hilary Duff smiling in the foreground.  
Might even be a Guinness Book record in it for most close-ups of a smile.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The character comes from the TV show by the same name.  Lizzie McGuire is
this drop dead cute teenager with a propensity for self embarrassment.  
That's pretty much the theme as I understand it.  
She is a "good girl" and "nice person" with a pesky kid brother 
who has his own evil muse, "Melina" played by Carly Schroeder.  
The few seconds when the evil muse was on screen were
the only seconds when the movie really got interesting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lizzie graduates from middle school and takes a school supervised trip to
Italy where she plans to have an adventure.  Turns out she is the exact
double for a popular Italian pop-singer except for the hair.  She is courted
by the singer's ex-partner who wants her to appear with him as his old
partner.  Lizzie is too naive to suspect that there is anything wrong with
this scenario.  And, it is an adventure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Totally improbable but it was cute.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Matrix Reloaded" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was of two minds going into the theater.  The basic Matrix idea was pretty
well covered in the first movie.  Other than more action, bigger body count,
et al, what could they do?  The whole Matrix idea of a machine creating a
virtual reality to keep its human batteries believing that they have lives
is a bit extreme.  Then you throw in a matrix embedded human who hacks his
way into the matrix code and discovers that he is not what he thought.  
Lots more extreme.  
Throw in a small rebel force of free humans who are following
a prophecy about one who will free everyone from the machine, and you have a
real comic book origin story.  Once you have done the origin story,
everything else is pretty much anti-climax.  We all saw that in the 
"Batman" movies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the other hand, there was promise of some really spectacular special
effects.  So, expecting to be let down as far as a plot goes, I was expecting
to be more than compensated by the special effects.  The first part of the
movie lived up to my special effect expectations, in spades.  It also was
living up to my plot expectations.  Then, suddenly, with some exposition that
is supposed to be the death knell for an action movie, the whole first story
was turned on its head.  Mysteries left unexplained were made clear, and the
story got interesting.  Then, just before we got to the end, a whole new
mystery crops up.  And the movie doesn't end.  It takes a break with the
words "To Be Concluded" instead of the words "The End".

an overwhelming movie offering

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, your comment about being "underwhelmed by the movie offerings in recent
months" has goaded me into writing.
<i>((Great!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometime between July 11 and 22, my first movie will be shown at the
Philadelphia International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival. This will be the
world premiere, unless another festival sneaks in before then.  I'm not
certain how many other festivals will screen it, because they don't all have
the same excellent taste as Philadelphia.
<i>((Indeed!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My movie is a 65-minute (that counts as a feature, right?) gay sex comedy
called Fluff.  I wrote it and produced it, and now it's my job to flog it to
the all-important postal-Diplomacy-old-fart market.
<i>((Why, absolutely, you must!))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Heath takes over as Italy (welcome, Heath!).
But Jim Sayers resigns as Germany.
Here's what Jim has to say: "What a long and happy time we have had,
including reading your zine as well as playing.
I am now 77 and must be one of the oldest codgers in the 
game, time I feel to retire gracefully. I don't feel up to much more 
bloodshed so perhaps I had better retire from all games.
It really has been a lot of fun."
Note he says "we" but I received no note from fellow "retiree"
Allan Heikkinen.
Perhaps Allan is sticking with the game.
We'll see.
Thanks, Kevin Wilson, for jumping in to replace Jim Sayers!
I hope the round robin of player replacements is over though!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) An extremely earnest EFGIRT draw is proposed.... you got it right,
excluding Austria.
Please vote on this proposal with your Fall orders.
I think I need TWO no's to defeat this proposal, isn't that right??

1) My map making was a bit flawed last time, but only Sean seemed to notice:
"That's not a Russian fleet in Sev that would be a Turkish fleet."
And later, "as is a French army and I already covered that the fleet 
in Sev is Turkish."
That French army would be in Gascony.
Gee, I really did have quite a brain fart, didn't I?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) With these orders Jim Sayers retires from the hobby and the szine.
See his note above in the other game.
I've called just about everyone else on my standby list in recent
months, so I couldn't resist asking Eric Brosius to come in as England.
It really WAS his turn on the rotation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND): Like what you see?  A true gamer gets the best possible 
result for himself, and you have the opportunity now to do MUCH better than a 
five-way draw.  For more of the same next turn, write me and let's talk!!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to WORLD): Stalemate, schmalemate!  The alliances in this game need a 
little shaking up....NOW who wants to talk?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
But you never know, given how extreme the yuppiedom part of the game
has gone.
I hope everyone will get orders in this time!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper, Sean O'Donnell, Dave Partridge, Alexander Woo, Eric Ozog
and Kurt Ozog are in to be six of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".
But we do need official wings rules, which I seem to be unable to locate.
Can anyone assist me there?
