<br /><br />A bit late again, but getting better.... we should have a whole group of
subszines below in the postal version...
And I've got lots of games finishing, so I'd like to start some new ones.
I've got a NEW regular Diplomacy game opening, I'd like to get the 
Modern game with wings going, and what about another Nuclear Yuppie Evil
Empire 7x7?  
This latest one really collapsed, but it can be a great way for "low 
maintenance Yuppie play".
If there's interest in that, I'll run that too.
I also would like to get Spy Diplomacy going, I'll publish the rules for that
so you can see it.
That's MY variant.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday.

David Wang still has the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings, once he gets back from the 
vacation that he's on right now.
Really, you can.
And Dick himself is lonely and he hangs out there even more
than John does, make Dick Martin's day, go to phantomempire!
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can start RIGHT NOW to pick up one of
the unclaimed teams and play it this year!
My team is still heading toward the playoffs, continuing 
to lead my division over the likes of Dicko's Baltimore Oriole team.
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

Sylvain played a LOT of FTF all up and down the East Coast back
in the late 1990's and then disappeared, I think he lived in Montreal
at that time.
John Quarto in particular keeps bugging me about finding Sylvain,
so I thought I'd toss him in here.
He shouldn't be THAT hard to find, but I've looked and failed.
Now it's up to you.
You have until issue 285 to do it for the fifty buck prize.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski, Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex

E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

I laughed at your "Go Barry and go Giants comment".  If the cheering I 
hear from the SF fans on the webcast is any indication, that's how the 
local fans feel, too: they like Barry and they like the Giants, in that 
order.  Unlike some Giants anti-fans, I have nothing against Barry. No 
more than any other Giant, that is.  I guess that means for me too the 
order of preference would be Barry and then the Giants ... and then the 
Giants fans.  I'll make an exception for you, though.  I know you're 
not to blame for the misdeeds of your compatriots.
<i>((And I really am more of a Red Sox fan now, my Giants love stems
from the teams of the late 60's and early 70's when I was even more
of a Giants fan than I am a Red Sox fan now.
I don't like Red Sox fans a lot of the time either.
I think anyone who EVER says "Yankees suck" is showing an amazing
level of ignorance and stupidity.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's have been seeing a lot of your two teams lately, and mostly losing. 
We've gotten stomped twice by the Red Sox and I expect we'll get 
stomped again tonight.  Yesterday the ESPN guy said something to the 
effect of "just when it looked like the A's were starting to get it 
together".  Huh?  I don't know what team he's following.  In fact, it's 
just the opposite.  A's racked up a bunch of wins a while back which 
gives them a cushion, but it was obvious to all of us here that we were 
headed for a rough patch.  Nothing serious in terms of the whole 
season, but the whole team is banged up and we're going into a tough 
patch in the schedule.  I wouldn't be surprised if we lose every game 
between now and the break.  But after the break we should be good to 
go, with Hudson and Chavez back and the others rested up.  A's 
definitely need the break this year.
<i>((I still think they have a tough way to go.
Won't those Rangers ever come back to the pack???))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think Mulder and Dotel are the only two pitchers on the entire team 
who aren't injured, overworked or both.  No, that's not quite true.  
Come to think of it, Zito isn't hurt; he just sucks.  (There's 
speculation that he's tipping his pitches again. Could be.)  With 
Hudson and Harden hurt, Redman has been killing himself trying to pick 
up the slack by starting on short rest and going much deeper into the 
game than he ought to, and now it's starting to catch up with him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Half the bullpen is on the DL.  Of the ones who aren't, Rincon, Mecir 
and Duchscherer are all playing hurt.  As far as I know, Bradford is 
healthy, but he's been worked too much.  I guess Lehr is one other who 
is neither hurt nor overworked, but he's a rookie and can't really hold 
the pen together alone.  Thank heavens for Dotel; he and Mulder are the 
only two pitchers on the team who are 100% right now.  
<i>((Just give it some time.... you've only had Dotel for a month...
sorry, it needed to be said.))</i>
I laugh when I 
hear the national commentators talk about "Oakland's great pitching 
staff".  Well, yes, it's great, but it sure isn't right now.  
<i>((You do still lead the league in ERA pitching, but Boston is
right there too and the Red Sox pitching could be described just the
same way.
I wonder sometimes JUST how bad some of these other pitching staffs must be.))</i>
Then again, these are the same guys who still talk about the "big three" so 
obviously they didn't get the memo.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The hitters aren't in such bad shape, but they're not in the best place 
either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Byrnes is going into his traditional second-half slump.  He ought to 
be getting some days off, and Macha knows it, but the only other 
outfielder is Kielty who has bruised ribs and can only bat RH (he's 
usually a switch-hitter).  We used to have a fifth outfielder, but he's 
on the DL.  I think Hatteberg needs a day off, too.  In that case, 
there's options.  I love Hat, and he's still hitting well, but I think 
Macha should sit him a game or two and play Karros at first, leaving 
Durazo in DH.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The worst is at 3B.  McLemore's knee is falling apart and he shouldn't 
be playing at all.  But our third-string 3B (German) is also hurt and 
can't hit at all. He's still on the roster only for defense and pinch 
running. If we needed room, they'd probably put him on the DL, but 
there's no one else to bring up anyway, so why bother. McLemore is the 
reverse: he can still hit, which is why he's been in there, but his 
defense is suffering and so is his running. (He used to be a speedy 
type, so when he was taken out for a pinch-runner a few days ago, that 
was a first for him.) We've been playing the fourth-string infielder 
(Castro) at 3B occasionally, too, but he's a career minor-leaguer who 
isn't the same quality. We've actually got better 3Bs in Sacramento, 
even after trading Teahen, but they won't come up. (Castro usually 
plays 2B in Sacramento.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Beane doesn't like to bring up young players before they're ready to 
stay. Veteran minor-leaguers who are going to bounce back and forth 
anyway, fine, but not the real prospects.  According to the official 
spin it's all part of the organization's plan for properly grooming 
players physically and psychologically, blah blah blah.  That's 
probably partly true, but as with most things for the A's, it's also 
financial.  I don't understand exactly how it works, but if a guy comes 
up sooner, that means he'll become a free agent sooner, so anyone that 
Beane expects he'll want to keep on the big-league team won't come up 
until he's ready to stay for a while. He won't blow a year on the far 
end of the contract just to have a few weeks of play on the front end.  
That's why, for example, you won't see Joe Blanton pitch for the A's 
any time soon, even though we could use him right now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the bright side, Kotsay, Dye and Crosby seem to be in good shape.  
They're pretty much the only ones right now. The catchers are doing OK, 
but both are sore and could use the break.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Silly me.  I started writing this email when I tried the webcast and it 
hadn't started yet.  Now I suddenly realized it's almost 4:00 and I've 
been missing the pre-game show....

<i>((Cool, first pitch should be about to happen, I'm still at work,
but I'll get in the car soon to listen on my way home.  I expect
you're right.  I'd be very shocked if the A's win tonight.
Schilling is MOTIVATED right now, what a competitor.
On Barry, you also have to remember that I was a fan of his father's
from back when Bobby Bonds was brought up to the Triple A farm
club in Phoenix (at the time that's where it was), and my
affection has carried over.  Also, I'm an economist and pretty
much believe that if baseball didn't care and wasn't testing,
anything Bonds did was allowed.  We're not going to be able to
maintain this "purity" that we never had anyway.  But that was a
cool team that Phoenix AAA had way back then.  I also was a 
big fan of Ed Goodson, but he never made it as big as Bobby Bonds.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Then... look, see how Schilling fought his way out of the first inning,
rendering that double to Kotsay useless!  That's what I mean!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark Lew (Thu, 8 Jul 2004 16:42:34 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, though we did make him throw a bit, more than I had hoped.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course the real question is how long Harden lasts.  Our bullpen is 
for shit right now.  We've probably got about two good innings there.  
Any more than that and you'll be in the double-digits again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's radio says that McLemore and German are both completely unavailable 
today, which means we're playing with a 23-man roster. I took a look at 
the roster and I see eight guys on there playing hurt. Those two plus 
Kielty and five pitchers.  Plus all the guys on the DL.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hudson won't be back before the All-Star Break, and he won't pitch in 
the AS game either.  (There's some debate about whether he goes to 
Houston at all, but my guess is that he goes and they send a trainer or 
two along with him.)  In Cleveland, Saarloos (temporary call-up from 
AAA) will start the first game, which lets Mulder get an extra day of 
rest.  Maybe we'll take one of three there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's record is exactly what it was at the same point last year.  The 
difference is that Seattle isn't off to its usual good start, so we're 
not nearly so far behind.  I knew Seattle would be bad this year, but I 
didn't think they'd be THAT bad.

<i>((I actually did suspect that Seattle would fall off the table this year.
I was pretty sure they would finish last, though they are a BIT further 
behind than even I expected them to be.
Picking up Spiezio was doomed not to help them, and Edgar/Olerud were both
clearly done.
They finally gave up on Olerud and released him, even when he was good he
was a first baseman with no power.
He should go to someone like... the Yankees!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doh!  Kotsay left at second again!
What really impresses me is that Schilling struck out Hatteberg twice 
in a row.  Nobody strikes out Hatteberg twice in a row.  Hat has the 
lowest strikeout ratio in the majors.

<i>((Yes, I was impressed by that too, we did get into 
bullpens, former A's closer and present Red Sox closer
Keith Foulke blew the save, but the Red Sox came back and
won in the tenth on a NICE piece of baserunning by the kamikaze
Johnny Damon who wasn't slowed at all by fouling a pitch off
his knee, scoring from first on a double to left.
And yes, I'm glad they got McLemore out of there, it was
PAINFUL watching him try to run the bases earlier in the series.
Good luck against the Indians!
PS this means I'm not worried about the A's beating out the Red
Sox for the Wild Card, their way to the playoffs is through
the Rangers and the division title.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Mark Lew (Thu, 8 Jul 2004 17:33:47 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just heard that Chavez is expected back tomorrow in Cleveland.  I 
didn't realize he was returning before the break.  That probably means 
German goes on the DL to make room for Chavez, and Castro stays on the 
team as backup utility infielder.  McLemore will stay on the bench as 
emergency backup and maybe pinch-hitter, but I wouldn't be surprised if 
they don't use him at all before the break.  When German gets better, 
presumably he comes back as backup utility infielder (which he was 
earlier this season) and Castro goes back to Sacramento.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When Harden was in a jam a while ago, the local announcers were talking 
about whether the team could get a starting pitcher up from Sacramento 
to pitch in Cleveland tomorrow.  Not just joking either, they were 
serious.  If we need a long man, Saarloos is the only real option, and 
he's supposed to start tomorrow in Cleveland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My bet is that Harden stays in even if it gets really ugly.  They're 
willing to let him clean up his own mess even if he gets 10 runs hung 
on him, just so long as he doesn't hurt himself for the long-term.  But 
he won't pitch again before the break, so they can go ahead and wear 
him out if necessary.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually, we're not nearly as far behind as I expected to be.  
Schilling has thrown a lot of pitches.  If we get into your pen maybe 
we actually have a chance to win.  Then again, Schilling doesn't pitch 
again before the All-Star game either, so maybe they'll leave him out 
for a long time, too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Torre's managing the AL this year, right?  Good thing he's more decent 
than his employer is.  Otherwise he'd probably make Schilling and 
Mulder pitch three innings each just to wear them out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[...] Wow, Byrnesie just got a home off Schilling.  Cool.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) As quickly as the Dogs of War released on the Duck, 
they were quacked back into the kennel.
This well may be a first in DipDom, or should that be DipDon,
that a player NMRs and then has the other side of the board
concede a draw to a coalition that includes him.
Yes, the EFG passes and the EFGIT fails, so the game is
over with that result.
Since there were some comments with some of the votes about 
"wanting the bigger or the smaller draw" I need to say that
my policy is that if multiple draws pass, then it is the smaller
one that counts.
However, here it didn't matter since you all voted for EFG, but
at least one of you did NOT vote for EFGIT.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) BUT, I must not abrogate my responsibility to admit my.....
yes, Mike, here it comes.... my egregious error!!!
Last turn, I realized after I printed the szine, but JUST
before I copied it, that Mike could retreat A Mar-Pie.
You may all note that I handwrote it in on the postal version.
Sorry about that, I don't think it had anything to do with
the draw vote.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE to MISTER UNCLE JEFFY-POOH SIR):  "Why [I] made an alliance with 
him in the first place" is because of my predecessor's errors, not my 
own.  When I took over this spot, my fleets were committed against 
France and there were Turkish fleets next to my homeland.  Had I fought 
Sean then, I would have lost two Austrian centers plus two Italian home 
dots (or one plus Tunis) within a year.  My only choice was to ally with 
him long enough to get his fleets into the Atlantic.  By the way, since 
he took Tunis, we've swapped one center for one despite his "having an 
ally" - I wouldn't call this "get[ting] his ass kicked by a psycho." 
But it probably will develop closer to that than the opposite, so I'll 
vote both I and T out of the draw unless they give me EFGI.  If Don were 
playing I'd want the game to continue just for that reason.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to MIKE BARNO): Never mind!....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MISTER UNCLE JEFFY-POOH SIR): Interestingly, your nephew seemed
to have the same logic in reverse, so both Italy and Turkey voted themselves
out of the draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ROME):  I'm pleased to report that Don did in fact demonstrate signs of 
life via e-mail, albeit only six words long, none of which was "mayonaisse".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MISTER MYKEY-POOH SIR): Yes, I know how you hate that....
but mayonaisse isn't even a word.
And Mr. Williams may be many things, including most definitely NOT being
a gentleman, but he most assuredly IS a scholar.
But this WAS enough for you to vote him into the draw....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WORLD2 to SCOTLAND):  The Italian ambassador will soon come a-calling, 
bearing a case of Knob Creek.  An attach&#233; was heard to express doubts 
about a gift of mere bourbon whiskey (with an "e") bestowed upon the 
leaders of the source of single-malt whisky.  The ambassador apparently 
growled something along the line of "Shut up, we'd give them panther 
piss if it meant getting their vote for our preferred draw."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TAP EDITOR): You know, we're SUPPOSED to clean up everyone's 
egregious grammatical errors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TAP EDITOR to BOOB): Yeah, but some of these guys do these things 
intentionally, what am I, a mind reader???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TAP EDITOR): But single malt WHISKY???  They never heard of
such a thing in the wild, wild west, which is the only place they use
that spelling.
And besides, Ohio is hardly the wild, wild west.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TAP EDITOR to BOOB): Sometimes, the bed you make is the bed you lie in.
And now (since you guys write this stuff JUST for me...):

In 1999K, it looks like I avoided elimination via the draw result 
(although I don't really deserve to be part of it, I'll take it anyway). 
Bernie avoided (possibly/probably) having to resign due to illness (and 
we were the two remaining original players). This leads into the main 
reason 1999K was not so `fantastic a voyage'. There were too many 
changes of players (for whatever reason) and this did affect play and 
the alliance structure. It was interesting that not one alliance stood 
for the whole game.
<i>((Yeah, I wish Bernie the best, and all things considered I think
it WAS a good result for just the reasons you say.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
England played for an alliance with Germany versus France at the 
beginning. When the Aus/Tur juggernaut appeared a rapid Eng/Ger/Rus 
triad was formed to counter that (Fra becaming the odd man out and 
subsequently disappearing). It was the resignations of Aus (Gorman), 
Ger (Shreve) &amp; Tur (Ellis) that played havoc with the alliance 
structure. I think, at the end, we had the new Tur &amp; Rus combining and 
fighting their previous respective ally. The game looked to become a 
three way Ger/Rus/Tur slugfest.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
England's major error came in 1909 where I should have defended my 
position against the new Ger player (Emmert). Then I would have been 
more of a factor in the later turns.
<i>((Emmert is JUST such a dot grabber.... someone should have
warned you.  
Of course, the GM cannot do this sort of thing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I enjoyed most of the press in the game except for the `toilet' 
humour of some (but, hey, if the GM allows it). I thank `Jim-Bob' for 
spending the time (four years) and effort to keep this postal game 
going.
<i>((You're quite welcome.
On the toilet humor, I've always gone with the loosest of possible
editing pens.
I am very clear in my house rules about it.
The idea is that all things are played out within the game.
And I make people involve me to insure it doesn't get out of hand.
So if you want to look like a horse's ass, I'll let you look like one,
but I'll also make sure you call ME a horse's ass too!
And then you finish this with some press....))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
This turn, Fall 1916 is two game years by that measure.
PS I may do a GM judgment call that no "real" center movement
has occurred if there are only small insignificant trades of
centers that are done (that will include the one that
happened this turn, even though it technically involved "taking a
center").
I suppose if this continued, and Germany keeps taking more centers,
especially home Turkish centers,
we'd go back on "regular voting rules".
I'll think about what that addition would be and make a ruling next issue.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
This was the last big move, Sandy popped back in to pop our leaders
one in the nose, and the leader Paul got his orders in as usual.
But the outcome is pretty well set now.
Come on, get those last fall orders in!!!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
(As we can see, Tom and David are neck and neck for the lead in this, but
Rick is sweeping up all the points.)
I'm not setting up a separate scoring method.
BUT..... we can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick already is way ahead of this pace).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I had a question about the tiebreakers... it is rider (A then B then C then D);
highest card played; highest card in hand.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM-DAVE): That was exactly the question I had for you!  I don't feel at liberty
to say everything I could.  If we can talk Tim into another game, you think you
can beat him, knowing he'll most likely do the same thing?
((new paragraph))  I think what's required is an in-depth analysis of the game,
including seeing what happens using different strategies.  Then you have to
figure out what needs to be done to be the farthest across the finish line the
turn the finish line is crossed.  There!  I've just told you how to win.  Your
task, the hard part, is implementation...   &lt; heh &gt; 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM-BOOB): That applies to this game, too, doesn't it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB-TOM): Ayuh, damn straight.
Especially hard when Bruce is lost!!
He just got remarried, I think, and is "busy".
Help, anyone hear from him??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOMER - FIELD):  Woo-hoo!  Look at that blubber fly!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CLAY-SPADES):  Hey!  What are these interlopers doing on "our" space?  I thought
we reserved this position for just us!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to CLAY): It's OK, they've taken off and left you in the dust with 
minimal replenishment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BART - BOULDER): I tried to stay back and collect cards, but the rest
of the family dragged me along with them!  Really, I didn't want to
play the frontrunner strategy again, but I thought other players
would make their moves last turn!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BART): Then again you scored lots of Sprint points with those moves!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOULDER-HISSELF):  What kind of a draw is that?  Time to discard and re-draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MR. BURNS - SMITHERS): Now where is that $1 trillion bill.  I need to
give money to the Bush campaign.
(In background, you see Homer put a greenback with a large number of
zeros on it into a Coke machine.  It goes in and comes out again.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOMER): Stupid machine!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to HOMER): Think precious bodily fluids...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOULDER - BOOB):  What's the weather like out your way?  We've been sweltering
out here.  It's so warm, the carpenter ants chewing in the walls are still going
during the "cool" part of the day: just before dawn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) You all voted for the concession, so we're done. 
I've now got three games to summarize, and we'll do all of those next time!
But first, we have.... Tah-Dahhhhh! 
Drum Roll, please....
the STAR TREK Season Finale!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK SEASON FINALE: UNCAGED!): Our last episode begins with the
Federation in a desperate fight for survival against the evil 
Romulan Star Empire and their confused allies, the Bejorans.
Starfleet has lost its entire fleet with the starship Enterprise
the only remnant of the now fallen, once mighty Federation.
What a surprise, the Enterprise being the only ship in the Quadrant.
Having taken several disruptor blasts to her hull with the
shields down, the Enterprise hides in a nebula in a last gasp
defiance of the Romulan onslaught in a desperate attempt to make
repairs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK'S LOG): Acting Captain's final log.  Captain Kirk is dead
(Oh no! Not again).
Communications with Engineering have been cut off and I believe
the entire section, including Mr. Scott have been exposed to
the vacuum of space by the Romulans' last disruptor blast.
Dr. McCoy should be at his post in sickbay, but he has chosen
to spend his last moments on the bridge, completely ignoring
his duties and simply annoying me to no end.
This is the point of the log where I bore the viewing audience
to death with notations of commendations for the cast and crew,
but I've decided to skip that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dr. McCoy interrupts Spock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MCCOY): Spock, there's something that I just don't understand.
Why would the Bejorans help the Romulans take over the universe
knowing that the Romulans will enslave, torture, and even 
exterminate the Bajoran population?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): I've actually done some research and I've discovered that
the New Bajoran President seized political power toward the 
end of the war and had a personal grudge against Captain Kirk.
It turns out he is the brother (by adoption) to the now 
deposed Grand Nagus of Ferenginar.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MCCOY): A Bejoran adopted by a Ferengi?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Yes, Doctor.
After the Cardassian withdrawal, many Bejoran orphans were
adopted by a variety of cultures, including Earth, Vulcan,
Andoria, and Ferenginar.
Grand Nagus Huey and the new Bejoran provisional government
president Dewey are brothers by adoption and President Dewey
will do anythign to avenge the Federation invasion of his 
brother's beloved Ferenginar.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MCCOY): Damn it, Spock!
We are the Federation, not the Cardassians!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Actually, we were the Federation, now we are one
broken starship.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MCCOY): It doesn't matter!
Grand Nagus broke two treaties with the Federation and attacked
us twice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Don't forget, Doctor, our refusal to fight the Romulans
with the Ferengi made Grand Nagus predict the ultimate Romulan
victory.
Also the Cardassians in their infinite wisdom decided to conduct
maneuvers near Deep Space 9 and the Bejoran home world destabilizing
the whole universe.
After the fall of Ferenginar, the universe should have aligned
against Romulus.
Bejoran President Dewey's kingmaking alliance with Romulus was
a misguided attempt to salvage his brother's failed 
administration, by making the "attack me and the Romulans
win" prediction come true, while at the same time masking both of
these brothers' inability to maintain any treaty and their
lack of ability to win any real engagement.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MCCOY): So how much time to do you think it will be before the 
Romulans find us?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At that moment another disruptor blast hits the Enterprise,
this time near the Bridge.
Many of the viewscreens on the Bridge explode, killing Chekov,
McCoy and Uhura.
Spock found himself crawling on the floor when whe realized
that he was the last "man" alive on the Enterprise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He glanced up at the viewscreen one last time and he could
see four Romulan War Birds and the light of one last
disruptor.
The last thing Spock saw was a bright blinding light before
he lost consciousness....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
... then what seemed to be a moment later Spock woke up and saw
something that made his green blood curl.
(A fat Trekkie woman in a tight Captain's shirt?)
Spock was lying in a hospital bed, standing beside him was a 
man, feminine in physique, with a very large misshapen head
wearing a long white gown.
The man was the zoo keeper!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Fascinating!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): As I sense you have deducted, the starship Enterprise
never left Talos 4.
All of the adventures the ship and crew encountered, including the movies,
the four series, and the Trek conventions were illusions we placed in
your mind.
You've never actually met the "real" Captain Kirk.
We have been running this illusion for 38 years.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Why wake me now?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): Our doctors have determined that you have Bendi
syndrome and your prognosis is terminal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Guess again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Zoo Keeper became startled as he realized he could no longer
read Spock's mind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): What happened?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): You forget, I am a Vulcan.
I have spent the last 38 years concentrating on my own
telepathic abilities and I surpassed you guys a long time ago.
I didn't know about your deception when you faked Captain
Pike's escape from Talos 4, but when the Enterprise went on
its first mission with Captain Kirk I knew I was still on
Talos and that the mission was an illusion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): How?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): In the first five minutes of the episode Kirk
defeated me in 3D Chess.
No human had ever beat a Vulcan before.
Shortly after that I gained superiority in my mental abilities.
The adventures were not illusions you placed in my mind,
they were illusions I placed in your mind.
The Federation doesn't exist.
The Enterprise computers had been programmed to give false information
to any intruder and then self destruct in seven days if myself,
Number One, or Captain Pike did not enter a certain access code.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): But we read the minds of each crew person,
(Notice the idiotic, politically correct usage of the word crewman.)
they have a clear memory of the Federation.
If there is no Federation, then who are you people?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): I am the evil Mr. Spock and our universe is actually the 
mirror universe.
I doubt there actually is another universe.
Field Marshal Kirk is at this moment on his way to rescue us in the
Imperial ship the BP Oil.
I simply wiped your memory of the Empire and made up the Federation
story.
My telepathic distress call tood 38 years to get to and from Earth.
I was also able to telepathically broadcast all of the illusions
to Earth with help from you guys by using that Menagerie episode
to set it up.
I understand that my illusion was a hit back on Earth.
I'm a little lucky that there was a Vulcan there to receive the
message and that your telepathic powers don't accumulate when a number
of you get together.
It's a little like that stupid "Children of Plato" episode where the
evil telekinetic "alien Greeks" were overpowered by Captain Kirk.
You know it is too bad I couldn't have overpowered you guys 
(do you have genders here?) earlier.
All I could do is block you from getting the Enterprise access code.
I couldn't save the ship and fly myself and the crew off this Rock
38 years ago.
By the way, you guys are all about to die.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): Why kill us now?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Revenge mostly.
The real Vulcan is identical to Romulus.
We are going to kill you for the fun of it while we use a Genesis torpedo
to turn this rock of a planet into a garden and an Imperial Base.
What is really hard to believe is that you bought the "Star Trek"
story to begin with.
I mean think about it, a race of humans where no one has any religious
affiliation good or bad.
No poverty, Sisco's dad owns a restaurant, Quark owns a bar, and the 
crew regularly plays poker, but no one has any money because there is
no need?
What did you think the Federation officers were paying Quark?
What was the crew gambling with?
No TV?
How was the crew supposed to look at their porn or get their news?
A Federation military organization that doesn't believe in warships.
That Captain Picard idiot who could have destroyed the entire Borg
collective with a computer virus but refused because that would
be "immoral".
The empire would have thrown him into space without a suit over that one.
I really thought that one would blow my cover.
I mean, really, can you imagine a universe without baseball and the long
suffering Boston Red Sox fan?
The whole thing was pretty Polyannidiotic if you ask me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE ZOO KEEPER): You know, we still have enough ability to confuse the
BP when it gets here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): I think not, the Genesis device is on its way.
It can't be altered and it was a transporter matrix on it that weill
beam any human or Vulcan on Talos 4 to the out of your range BP.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At that moment, Spock disappeared in a transporter matrix and moments
later the rock that was Talos 4 was turned into a Class M planet.
Spock and the 110 survivors who had been informed of Spock's illusion
were now safe on the BP.
Field Marshal Kirk introduced himself to Spock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): I'm confused, Mr. Spock, according to our scans the Talosians
telepathic abilities should have accumulated.
Two of them should have been able to overpower you mentally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): That is correct, Field Marshal, most of their abilities were enhanced
by a Tachyon computer generator, but I was the strongest.
I simply wiped their memories of the knowledge of that ability and 
convinced them it would be futile to try.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Remind me to avoid playing you in poker.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): As you wish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): We do have a small problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Enlighten me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): The Genesis torpedo had a small protomatter leak on its journey
to Talos and it interfaced with your mental transmission because of its
Tachyon energy.
The connection opened a dimensional door and the scanners were able to 
scan what the interface created.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): What did it produce?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): We can't prove it, because the dimensional door closed quickly,
but we think it created a Federation ship turned into Ferengi in what
looks like the perpendicular universe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): A real Federation ship with a real Captain Kirk and Dr. McCoy???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): We think so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Just kill me now.
By the way, did the Red Sox ever win the World Series while I was on 
Talos 4?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Nope, they lost a seven game series in the playoffs to a team from
Andoria last fall.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): The Curse of the Bambino, 300 years and counting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With its mission accomplished, the Empire colonized Talos 4.
Ironic, because that was the Talosians' original intent.
As Kirk and Spock spoke, the BP set a new course for its next
exploitation mission for the Empire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK to KIRK): Is there really a Dr. McCoy?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Not on this ship!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): .... good because I probably would have killed him on sight
just to be safe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Care for a game of 3D Chess?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): I'll pass!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): Thank you for running the szine and my press.
Sorry about the length of this one but it was, after all,
the Season Finale.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): Indeed, it was, not as hard to type in as it seemed
when I looked at it.
But everyone else should realize that it DID delay the szine a couple of
extra days as I hunted for time to type it in.
You sure you don't want to get an E-Mail account and type these things in???
Seriously though, I did enjoy them, especially this mind bending Season 
Finale....
