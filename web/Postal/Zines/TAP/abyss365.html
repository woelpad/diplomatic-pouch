<br /><br />So, my run of good luck in the medical issues continues.
But I'm not completely free yet, and still under treatment.
Sometimes this seems like a bit of a netherworld, but is much better
than the alternatives.
Mark Fassio is doing somewhat better, but still in fits and starts.
Continue to keep especially him in your prayers and thoughts.
Let me know if you need to know more about how he's doing, I'll
just do periodic updates here.
The new Kendo Nagasaki game starts this issue, I like running them and
I also like playing in them... mostly.  Plenty of time to join still.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That all should keep the szine cranking and I'd like to start another regular
Diplomacy game in addition to the Breaking Away that's getting close to six!
Wishing all the rest of you who are struggling with 
health issues similar good news!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
The address is still:
http://diplom.org/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the new list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, we'll see if that helps.
Please let me know.

<i>((First a brief summary of who did really well with picks way back in April.
Doug Kent nailed Toronto being the class of the AL East, but thought Detroit, Chicago, Seattle and Oakland would
succeed in the rest of the AL.  He didn't have the Royals repeating.
Goz similarly got the Toronto pick, but had Cleveland and Seattle.
While I lost all three with the Red Sox, Cleveland, and Seattle.
Boy, Seattle underachieved!!!
In the NL, I missed the Nationals being underachievers but got the Mets resurging season and the rest of the NL
pretty well, but I thought the Cardinals would be the ones getting to the World Series instead of the Mets.
Goz had similar picks and also overestimated the Nationals, but 
Doug gets the booby prize for useless NL picks having the Mets in Last Place in the East with
Miami and Washington at the top, scrambling the Central with the Pirates and the Reds at the top, 
and having San Diego winning the West.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Blue Jays over Yankees in 5.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Wild Card:  Cubs over Pirates.  Because Arrieta.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  Mets over Dodgers in 4.  Cards over Cubs in 4...because Arrieta can only
pitch once.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Mets over Cards in 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Blue Jays over Mets in 6.

The Cubs rookie 3B/OF Kris Bryant has MLB's top selling jersey.  The last Cub
to do that was Frank Chance.  Jim-Bob, do you still have yours?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Blue Jays over Royals in 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sound logic to me.  I'll call a home run for the star pitcher.
<i>((That was Rick agreeing on the NL Wild Card that Arrieta would be the star and
get the Cubs forward... the Cubs did indeed move forward.))</i>

Dodgers over Mets in 5. Cards over Cubs in 4.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) There is an AEF draw back on the table for Summer, 
especially with Melinda having to resign, after so long, I'm going to put in a special YES vote on
the three way draw proposal.
Of course, any of the rest of you can vote no, and if you do NOT vote for the Summer turn, it will
be recorded as a NO and also veto the draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We're all getting older, aren't we?  Melinda is having some medical problems and will have to resign.
I'm going to record her for Summer as voting yes, and if the proposal doesn't pass, then I will replace
her to submit Fall orders.
I recognize that means that with no order received the Army Venice would retreat off the board
in the Summer turn, but if the game continues, I am going to retreat it to Rome (or anyplace else
if Melinda happens to send me an order).
We all hope Melinda works through her medical problems and is OK again soon!!!

<br /><br /> <br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
I think it is very interesting the way the energy in the hobby ir ramping up in recent times.
From my perspective, it seems to have been fueled largely by the "way greater than life"
figure of Toby Harris, who finally after more than two decades of trying (sometimes trying NOT
to let people know how much he wanted it) won the World DipCon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still remember his whole demeanor at the Paris World DipCon he and I were both at
so long ago... whichever one it was... 2001 just before 9/11 changed te world,
where he was so disappointed not to get on the Top Board.
 - Cyrille Sevin won one of his many World titles with Brian Dennehy and Chetan Radia close
behind, as I recall... and Edi Birsan playing Kingmaker.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But since then, the Diplomacy in Europe Facebook page has exploded, and so much
energy seems to be out there.
Games across Europe have been happening (Dave van Leeuwen running the Dutch Open, a French tournament
over Columbus Day weekend hosted by Gabriel Lecointre, games within companies using Diplomacy to
build teamwork (led by Sebastian Dinjens), lots of "student games".  
The Game also is exploding in China.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And most recently Christian Pedone ran a speedy "texting game" and is running another one now.
I hope we can get the Diplomacy World Cup started to take advantage of that energy (time
for another nudge from me on that!!!).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This all is stupendous for the future of the hobby.  Once I get past this cancer thing,
I'm going to dive back in with more energy too.
I hope all of you are finding the places to play that make the most sense to you, or
you're just starting to host your own club games.
This whole group of people is just such a fantastic group of people, who could have more
friends than any of us???

As I keep getting older, I continue to greatly mourn those who have been lost, and maybe
this szine is a bit too morbid a place that way - with games in honor of both Phil Reynolds
and Don Williams - but hey, I think I'm just about past that.
Let me know if you're looking for something in the hobby that I can help you find, 
I am a big lurker just about everywhere, so I see all... watch out, I'm watching YOU!!!</b>
