<br /><br />You know how they say trouble comes in threes, well, of course it doesn't but
our puny minds coalesce around such triviatum.
But today is a day to resurrect some dedications in this holiday season, and I
need to make three of them, thankfully the latter two dedications seem to be 
having somewhat more hopeful endings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First off, I'd posted this on the <i>TAP</i> web page some weeks ago, but
most of you probably have not seen this.
We dedicate this issue to Jim Meinel and his daughter, Emily.
I have talked to a few of you about this, and some of you had met Jim's 
wife Jenae, 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.legacy.com/adn/Obituaries.asp?Page=Notice&amp;PersonID=120158947 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jenae passed away suddenly on November 10th and Jim really needs the 
support and good wishes of his hobby friends.  Drop him a note, either at
his E-Mail address of jim of meinel.org or postally at Jim Meinel,
P.O. Box 112147, Anchorage, AK  99511.
This is really, really tough, I know Jim can get through it, but it cannot
be easy.  Hang in there, Jim!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Secondly, Brad Wilson was hit by a car when heading home after work at the 
end of November.  So, we ALSO dedicate this issue to Brad Wilson!
Although Brad, of course, does not remember anything, someone did
stop and there was some identification of damage, though I'm not sure 
precisely how much Brad was able to find out about that or what legal
issues will be entailed from all this. 
Someone I know was hit by a car a year ago and is still recovering, especially
mentally, but though Brad did have a Grade III concussion (this is the form
where you lose consciousness and cannot remember anything around the event), 
I understand that he is doing pretty well.  He also has a broken leg which 
might also have some complications.   Send Brad best wishes as well, I have
not seen E-Mail from him yet, though others may have (you can try that at
bwdolphin146 of yahoo.com).  But his postal address if you want to drop him 
a Christmas card, New Year's card or other note is Brad Wilson, Apt. 3-C,
1115 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA  19107.  Hang in there, Brad!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And finally, as some of you are aware, there was a band of New York and New England
that was hit by the worst ice storm in a few decades just north of us.  
My parents lost power for a couple of days, some friends of ours lost it for
four or five days, but subszine editor Dave Partridge lost it for a full week.
I'll let Dave tell the details of his story in his subszine, which may or may
not appear in this issue, at this writing I'm going to stop holding <i>TAP</i>
waiting for him and just see when he gets it out. 
But Dave has been a subszine here for a long time, and it is way past time to
dedicate an issue to him as well!!!
We forget how much of our lives, especially in the winter when we can freeze to
death, is predicated on electric power.  
Dave did have his own generator, and could keep things going a bit, but that
required the "searches for the gasoline that the generator sucked up" that
my other friends whose power went out described about the same way.
You go out on these streets with power lines and trees down everywhere and try
to make your way to someone who has gas, if you fail and run out of gas yourself
in the car, you're really in trouble.
I'm glad Dave and his family made it through safely.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I would if I were you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is back in stasis, but all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back at least sometimes he is producing this new fannish thing
called <i>Virtual Tucker Hotel</i> that you can find at
http://efanzines.com/VTH/.
I am not sure I actually understand <i>VTH</i>, someday I'll hook up
on one of the live chats and then maybe I'll figure it out.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing as a subszine, but he has 
a cool facebook page and you can keep track of him there.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games
and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York and Doug Kent have been my most frequent subszine guests lately!!!
Andy has been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And Doug Kent has been coming out faster than <i>TAP</i> lately, so
many issues have been having multiple <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s. 
I haven't heard from Michael Lowrey lately but he gets his in every few issues too!
So, we have a full set of subszines at the moment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MICHEL FERON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jerry Jones gets added to the list of failures, next up the former
editor of <i>Moeshoeshoe</i>, along with Michel Liesnard one of the 
founders of the Belgian Diplomacy hobby.
If you read <i>Diplomacy World</i> #101 you will 
quickly figure out why I chose Michel Feron to search for next.
There are a host of clues on the Internet that I found, so he 
could be very easy to find. 
Go for it, you have until Issue #320.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am running out of people on MY list of who to search for, so
I am looking for ideas, who would you like to find?
Send me some names.
I will likely go into all these szines that Doug Kent is posting
and find some more szine editors to search for, that's
what I usually do, but I'd like to find people that some of you
will search for or want to find!!!
This actually is giving me a HUGE number of possible ideas for
people to search for, but I can be focused or induced.
Come on, help me out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jerry, Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jerry Jones or Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no
ISE.
If anyone still needs assistance with this, though, since I'm helping
John out, like if you're in a foreign country and need to send dollars
for dipping things to someone in the US, I may be able to help you out.

<br /><br />Also, I need any Hobby Award Nominations NOW (!!!) for the :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The 2005 and 2006 and 2007 Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The 2005 and 2006 and 2007 Rod Walker Award for Literature;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The 2005 and 2006 and 2007 John Koning Award for Player Performance;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The 2005 and 2006 and 2007 Fred Hyatt Award for GM Performance;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
or

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 A 2005 and 2006 and 2007 Kathy Byrne Caruso Award for Lifetime Achievement (if warranted).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The NEW Hobby Awards Committee is Jim Burgess (Chair and Treasurer),
Fred Davis, Jr., Melinda Holley, Andy York, Jack McHugh
Paul Kenny, Mark Stretch, and Robert Lesco.
I was going to publish the award ballot for this year 
in this issue, but I realized that I really just had to get this out first and
then do that.... and then, well, REAL SOON NOW!!!
And when I do, I'm going to give out three sets of awards and get caught up for the 
missed years, that seems to make the most sense.  
Committee.... you will be hearing more from me soon!
This also fell apart with my move, but I think I can get it together for next
issue when all the games are in Winter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Diplomacy World</i> Issue Deadlines are now:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Winter 2009, Issue #104: beginning of January; theme is
Worldwide Variants, we will have articles on Colonia VIIb, Known World 901,
and many more.  A new <i>DW</i> Demo Game in Known World 901 will also start, 
this variant is one of those David Cohen designed variants and it already has
been pretty extensively playtested.  If any of you are interested in playing,
let me know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Spring 2009, Issue #105: beginning of April; theme is "The
Endgame", what have you always wanted to know or read about about end game 
strategy, we'll feature it here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Summer 2009, Issue #106: beginning of July; theme is 
"Historical Variants" from pre-1900.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Fall 2009, Issue #107: beginning of October; theme is
"Balance of Power", arguably the key concept in all of Diplomacy, Eric Hunter,
Doug and I just realized that there are NO good articles around that actually
describe it.  The founder of the feast, Mr. Calhamer, of course has written on
it a couple of times, but he has, well, a singular view.  I hope we get a lot
of excellent articles on this topic, I'm writing one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
These last few issues have been really tremendous, if you've not looked at them 
yet, go look!
And for any issue, we're taking articles on ANY subject, let us know!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.diplomacyworld.net/ for some exciting back issue material being
posted as well as the new Issues, including the monstrous Issue #100.  
Highlights of #100 include Walt Buchanan's ex-wife Carol showing us who REALLY
was in charge of the hobby back in the Hoosier Archives days, Eric Ozog augmenting
the oft-heard, but never get enough of, love story between Eric and Cathy,
and the start of the new Diplomacy World Demo Game.
We also now have

 I'm organizing a tournament at TempleCon

More details are at http://www.templecon.org/09 and the hotel
block is presently full, but let me know if you need help

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tournament Schedule (half of the games on open deadlines):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 1: Start 6PM on Friday, no official stop time, Venue is on 
24 hour schedule, possible dinner or late night snack break will 
be worked out by Tournament Director based on course of games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 2: Start 9AM on Saturday, official Random Stop Time between 
4 PM and 5PM to allow for meal break between rounds, only announced
at beginning of last Fall turn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 3: Start 6PM on Saturday, no official stop time, Venue is on
24 hour schedule, possible dinner or late night snack break will
be worked out by Tournament Director based on course of games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 4: Start Noon on Sunday, official Random Stop Time between 4 PM
and 5PM, only announced at beginning of last Fall turn

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Board Assignments: Random using an announced commonly used program.
Tournament Director will play if necessary to fill out a board and can
possibly play positions on two boards simultaneously to fill out
boards - tournament director's scores do not count for any purpose,
including Best Country awards.  If replacement players are used in the
"no time limit" games because someone has to leave, the replacement will 
be the Tournament Director wherever possible and the original player will
get the full score credit for the game. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GAME TURN SCHEDULE: Run games on Central Clock using DipTimer with 
so-called "drop-dead deadlines".  Each player can have one (less than one 
minute) extension to get orders into the box per game.  Timing includes 
adjudication with a continually running clock allowing 17 minutes per 
Spring (including Winter adjustments) and 15 minutes per Fall season 
with retreats also taken out of negotiation time run as quickly as possible.  
This schedule may permit games to move ahead of the clock, which is allowed.
As games progress and with the speed of the game, the Tournament Director 
(especially in the timed rounds 2 and 4) will shorten these times at his 
discretion to get as many game years in as possible in each round.
The Tournament Director is viewing the drop-dead deadline as an educational
tool, since it is not often used in North American tournaments (see the
discussion on the Yahoogroup MADip for more on this), and will be keeping
the players appraised of the deadline as it approaches to ensure that players
have enough time to write orders.  Harassment of players trying to write
orders near the deadline will not be allowed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Voting on Draws/Game Stop: Comes out of negotiation time, Tournament
Director discretion can be disallowed or delayed for repeated 
requests.  Conducted by Tournament Director with anonymity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
-----------------

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Scoring System: Modified Detour98f

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the scoring system used for most New Zealand tournaments and
New England tournaments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you survive to 1905 then you get a point (whether you're
eliminated later or not). 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you are in the draw at the end of the game then you get a point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- You get a point for every supply centre you own.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you are in the outright lead then you get a bonus of the
difference between you and the next best player. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you are first on the board you get 4 bonus points, if you are
second you get 3 bonus points, if you are third you get 2 bonus
points, if you're fourth you get 1 bonus point. (If there's a tie you
all get the points for the lower position - i.e. equal 2nd both get 
2 bonus points)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- You add each person's points to get a raw score. The next step is to
standardize the game. Divide each person's raw score with the sum of
all the raw scores and then multiply by 100. This generate a 
percentage for everyone. So an entire game is worth 100 points and how
much of those points that each person gets is determined points 1-5.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you solo you get 110 points and everyone else gets *nothing*.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Tournament Scoring: All players will be awarded 50 Points upon 
entering the tournament.  To play in a game, in each round played,
there is an "ante" of 14 points (rounded down, approximately 100/7).
If Tournament players (to fill out boards) play more than one position
they will ante up twice, this will be avoided if possible though it
could result in a player playing more than four scoring rounds in
the tournament.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- There also will be Best Country awards for each of the seven
countries which can be won by people who play only one round, these will 
be based on the Detour game score, not Supply Center counts.

We were running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but see the new rules below, we're going to start over.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.
I haven't had much feedback here, we'll try to pick it up in the new year.

<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  
You send me ONE tune each issue, or a whole list, but I reveal them one tune at a
time over the next 23 issues.
If you missed earlier turns, you can still catch up by sending enough tunes to
catch up in subsequent issues, and guess on submitters each issue.
When you are CORRECT and guess someone correctly, I will tell you, but you
can only guess one person for each list each turn.
I am also submitting my tunes.
I will tell people each issue how many people have guessed them correctly, so 
you can tell that you're being predictable and try to take your list in another
direction.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I am now NOT telling you who the submitters are).  
For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections
or daring explanations (to encourage you to write things about the songs).
You lose a point for each person who gets your list right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: 
At least one tune and an explanation or comment.  I'll add one tune
to each list each issue.  You will always be able to catch up by
giving me enough tunes to catch up.

Hey Jim,
Just when I was starting to wonder if you'd gone down for the count, 
the latest issue of <i>TAP</i>, or at least something 
purporting to be <i>TAP</i>, arrived in my mailbox. 
I figured I would write you since my copy had the X in the space, 
suggesting that my sub was up. 
But of course I have a LIFETIME subscription to your szine, as per our contract 
when I was "found.." 
Seeing as you're an economist and therefore (presumably) feel that contracts are the 
lifeblood of our wonderfully successful economic system, 
I'm sure you're prepared to honor your agreement, 
to your death, or at least the death of your szine, whichever comes last.  
In the old days I believe "fakes" were usually perpetrated by others, 
not the actual zine publisher.  The fakers had to figure out who to mail 
the "fake" to, pay costs to produce, etc. 
They also had to do their best to make the "fake" at least 
somewhat believable. 
Since this "fake" arrived with an actual graphic cover instead of the same boring 
canned text thunk up at least a decade previously, 
about how Kevin Teague had grabbed the highly desirable 
internet domain name "szine.com," etc., etc., 
knowing this crap stuck on the front of your actual szine 
was a fake "fake" was pretty much child's play.  
<i>((Yeah, well you're the only one to comment this extensively!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Are you the first publisher to fake his own "fake"?
<i>((But I categorically deny faking my own fake.  
I don't know how that thing got stuck on the front of my szine and on 
my web page.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I guess it's a sad commentary on the state of "paper" publishing these days, 
if there's nobody out there willing to put time/effort into faking your szine. 
Is Boardman still publishing?  
<i>((Yes, it's a bit ragged itself on publishing speed, but it's still going.))</i>
If he is you could do him the honor of folding your rag and that would 
give him the (I'm quite sure) immense satisfaction 
of being not only the first, the most prolific, but also the 
last publisher of postal Diplomacy games. 
<i>((Nah, I intend to be last....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Where's Emmert? 
A cursory look through the szine didn't reveal him anywhere.  
<i>((He's around, maybe he'll say something when he sees this.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm glad to see Williams is still finding suckers willing to publish his drivel.  
If you really ARE thinking about raising your pub rates, 
and/or breaking your CONTRACT for my lifetime sub, 
you might think first about banning him from your zine 
and associated subzines.  Several acres of virgin forest 
in the Paul Tsongas National Forest would 
breath a sigh of relief, too.  
(This last punny bit for the benefit of Mark Lew, if he's still around - 
don't know if he'll get the reference, but he might.)  
<i>((Of course, Mark also is still around.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can we get back to these game openings below?  
We just need a few more people for a couple of these.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game of REGULAR Diplomacy if there is enough interest!!!
Doug Kent, Fred Wiedemeyer, Brad Wilson, and Shaun Thompson start the list, who would like to join them???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I published the rules again last issue!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.
Harold has been updating the Diplomacy A to Z, go check it out at:
http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/index.html 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, Steve Koehler, Art Schleinkofer,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, and Dave Partridge are signed up for that.

 A ticket to the boneyard

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wooooooh," inhaled the caterpillar, he looked down at the two gangsters from 
atop his toadstool.  He used one hand to flick an ash off his vest, 
with his other hand he continued to twiddle the bullet between his fingers, 
with his other hand he picked up his cup of coffee, 
with his fourth hand he pointed at the thin gunsel, 
"I believe for an elephant you would need a menagerie."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Oh, negatory Boss," the thin gunman shook his head, 
"thems menagerines are high bred fruit... all hoity-toitty like.  
Deys half tangerine and half... sumpin' else."      
The heavy set gangster behind him nodded vigorously in silent agreement.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The caterpillar sighed resignedly.  The thin gunman took that as a sign to go on, 
"yeah," he jerked a thumb over his shoulder to indicate the heavy set 
gangster behind him, "Huey here eats 'em up sumpin' terrific.  
Courses, they give him the indigestions."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The heavy set gangster, Huey, grimaced and nodded in reluctant confirmation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wooooooh," the caterpillar pulled on his pipe, 
water gurgled at the end of the hose, "I know just how he feels."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So's we finds our m&#233;nage a twa," said the thin gunsel, "and we scores big."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wooooooh, that is the general idea," intoned the caterpillar in his heavy voice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'll find dat flatfoot when I find dat oliphant, or my name ain't Luis del Castillo."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Out,"  said the caterpillar.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Whazzat Boss?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"OUT!" yelled the caterpillar, he waved all four arms for emphasis pointing to the door.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Louie," spoke the fat gunmen for the first time, "I tink he wants us to leaf."   
The two gunmen quickly backed to the door and through it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Coming out of the darkened back room brought the two into the coruscating lights and 
jazzy sound of the dance hall.  The sound of mingling people and multiple 
conversations washed over the two gunmen.  
They looked out over the club, seeing the patrons at the bar and the couples 
on the dance floor.  The thin gunman couldn't help but shake his head.
"If we'd just nabbed dat dame when she was a taxi dancer here, den' 
we wouldn't be going tru all dis misery," said Louie sagely, 
"who knew she was scopin' us out afore she went tover to da Copa 
to put her peepers on Evil."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The fat gunman, Huey, shook his head in slow commiseration.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Da boss won't be happy till we find dat broad and da gumshoe," said the thin gunman, 
"c'mon let's pound a few pages and toin sumpin up."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He headed out the front door with the fat gunman in tow, 
neither one noticed the patch of darkness that separated 
itself from the shadows and moved after them.  
The two gunsels walked out the front door underneath the sign that read 
"Centerland Ballroom", the sign next to the cashier booth read "Dances 10 cents".
Louie and Huey, sans Dewey, were on the trail.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So there I was with this doozy of a dame, hardly a dime to my name.  
I coulda called this chapter Down and out on a case, but da blonde had 
told me where we were going so it was definitely; a ticket to the boneyard.
We were in a small part of the Hobby called Variant-Town, 
where the more ethnic brands of Dip are played.  
We were staring at the trolley map in the station.  
It didn't make a lot of sense, it was almost like when the 
planners were in the Hobby they had their minds on something else.  
The different colored lines criss-crossed, disappeared and came back...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I still don't get it," said the aforementioned blonde, smacking her gum, 
"youse said the Boneyard was for decrepit and defunct szines."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, that's what I said," she was leaning over to better 
peruse the map causing her trench coat to fall open a little.  
I was perusing the obvious... the map, the trolley map, what d'ya think?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Isn't that redundant?  Decrepit and defunct?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Not in the Hobby," I knew we had to go back to the older neighborhoods, 
"I don't know if it's Silver Age or Golden Age... the Blue Line takes us North, 
it's the Yellow Line that goes South."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Da Yellow Line is fer losers," the blonde smacked her gum for emphasis.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Then we can catch the Red car East and transfer to the White Line...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A newsboy on the corner was waving a paper in the air;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Read all about it! Hierophant goes Missing!  Missing and Silent!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I don' think you can transfer at Galicia and 52nd," she said, eyeing the faded map.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What do you want to do, walk across the Hobby?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"We don't have time. Time is a train, makes the future past.  
We don' wanna be left standing in the station with our face pressed up against the glass," 
smacked the blonde.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I was gonna say with our thumb up our..." what I was going to say was 
interrupted by a shout; "You two!  You two!" 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, I already knew that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Stop!"

1) Terry is still having some medical problems, Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry until further notice.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CREDO): I believe Gavrancic will realize no one can
play to square 42.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB CALCULATES): And while someone COULD have hit 47, no one did,
so no one hit the jackpot replacements.
But Gavrancic did hit 45 to give Dragutinovic his 11, and to your
Sanctus.
Hosannas to you!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(USELESS STATISTIC OF THE DAY): The Turtle Moves - 2,
Famous Four - 1, Just Ordinary - 2, Alamo - 1.
