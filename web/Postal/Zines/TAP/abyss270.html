<br /><br />We debut a new subszine in this issue from Harold Reynolds, adding another Canadian
to the mix, <i>Hoi Polloi</i>.  
If you get it via E-Mail, you get the color version.
We're going to try to work up some better black and white Colonia maps too.
Stay tuned.
Anyway, this issue feast on two, count 'em TWO, Canadian subszines as we 
also hear from Rip Gooch after his recent trip!
Plus, we have another installment from Michael Lowrey.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />I've been having a bit more trouble with my ISP participating in attempts to 
stop sites that relay spam and having it cut some of you off from sending
E-Mail to me.
If this happens to you, you may have to write me a letter (just remember how
much postage I spend!) or call me, or try to reach me by E-Mail through someone else
in the szine who can receive your messages and still reach me.
Using my subszine editors like Harold Reynolds or David Partridge for such
purposes is probably a good idea.
The problems that seem to lead to most of the difficulties are either E-Mails
written in html or E-Mails with Word attachments that are "forwarded", as
opposed to attached yourself.
Each of these seems to raise the spam triggers at my ISP. 
The World is trying to become an industry leader in stopping spam, but
they are a bit over the edge right now.
These and related issues caused a screw up in the adjudication for one of the
games last issue that is corrected below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Make your plans NOW to join me at the "Boston Massacre" tournament in Boston at MIT
on June 21-22, 2003.
Show up and have a blast with a great bunch of FTF Dip players.....
Dave Partridge made a great web site with all sorts of info at
http://diplom.org/BostonMassacre/
It looks like we will have at least 30 players, but we have to get up to 69
in order to get me onto the tournament rankings, as I own 69th place.
So where are you guys???
I count only four <i>TAP</i>ites coming so far.
Do I have to threaten to fold again??? 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Lastly, before we go to other stuff.... a bit of commentary about this weekend's
death watch for the Big East college conference.
It shows what happens when an organization (the NCAA) makes an "innocuous" rule
about allowing college football conferences to hold a championship when they
have a twelve team two division conference.  
I don't even care about football, I care about college basketball, but this
is going to change the entire conference landscape before it is done, unless
the Notre Dame Fighting Irish go completely against type and storm in to save
the day.  
The only thing I can see that can save the Big East conference is if Notre Dame
joins it in football, likely in a devil's deal that allows them to keep all their
own revenue.
But given that this won't happen, you're going to see two or three more 12 team plus
leagues in the next few years. 
Perhaps the ACC will get what it wants... three more teams including Miami.
Perhaps the Big East will toss its non-playing football schools (like our
local Providence College team) and keep Miami and build 12 football schools,
or even if Miami leaves cannibalizing other conferences to build 12 teams.
The Big 10 (eleven) will also have to add a twelfth team
and at the end of it, all the conferences east of the Mississippi except for the
SEC (a twelve team conference, you guessed it!!!) will be scrambled.
Note that the NCAA thought that a little rule to allow a conference championship
in Football leagues with 12 teams would be COMPLETELY innocuous.
Right.
And will Boston College REALLY be happy in the ACC with all the other Catholic
schools in a new Catholic League conference?
Darn, it really hurts to care nothing about college football and see it doing
this to the landscape.
I'm depressed.....
come on, Notre Dame, go for it, save the day!!!
I doubt they'll resolve it at the Big East conference meeting this upcoming weekend,
so we'll be resigned to more stupid news and stupid talk.
Yuck.

<br /><br />The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count.

BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has one opening, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and

<b>THE SEARCH FOR STEVE KNIGHT AND MORE ON JERRY LUCAS</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Find Steve Knight by issue 275 and win the fifty buck prize!!
Steve Knight is famous for getting the first E-Mail game
going that was assigned a Boardman number, back in the early 
1980's.  I'll have more details in subsequent issues, but
it might or might not help you to know that Steve lived in
Minnesota at that time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, and Al found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe
or Al Pearson is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim-Bob,
I know you thought I had forgot about this but I haven't 
and I found the issues of <i>EE</i> with Jerry Lucas in them.  
Now I'm not sure what you want out of it so I'll tell you what it is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
His picture appeared, like the picture contests, in one issue.  It 
was of a guy in what I described as inside a wall locker, looking out.  
He had a shirt and a tie on (the picture is from the waist up), you see 
his face and it seems he is about to break into a smile.  You don't see 
hair on top of his head but that may be because it was in the shadows.  
The subbers were invited to tell what this person was like based just 
upon this picture.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The next issue came the guesses:  Guessing about Jerry were:  Keith 
Sherwood, Judy Winsome(!), Joan Extrom, Ben Schilling, John Pack, Ron 
Brown of California, Wallace Nicoll(a Briton) and Iwo Bouwman from 
Holland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who they guessed were:  No guess, James Woodson, Bob Olsen, John Pack, 
John Caruso, Mark Berch, Fred Davis and Judy Winsome (by Ron Brown who 
had actually seen Jerry).  "Judy Winsome" said it must be an old-timer 
in the hobby and guessed David Crockett, Ben Franklin or Rafael 
Sabatini.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then in the next issue, Jerry responds to all of these guesses (they had 
commented on his receding hairline, coming out of the closet, being a 
pushover in Diplomacy games, unfashionable tie, an old version of Jack 
Nicholson and so on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I then commented about the Jerry Lucas/Judy Winsome being one of 1982's 
biggest hoaxes and about "Winsome-Losesome" which was at issue 29 when 
this contest was run (December 1984 to February 1985).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not sure if I have any extra copies of these three issues but in 
each one of them I published this picture of Jerry in the wall-locker.  
If I do have an extra copy, I could cut out the picture page and send it 
to you if you want to somehow reproduce it. So let me know what you want 
to do.  I go to work in less than an hour so probably won't be able to 
respond until later tonight.........

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

All first round games need to be finished by the end of June.
Ray Setzer is viciously stabbing everyone in sight going for the win in
the game that I am GMing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.cat23.com/wm02 for full details.  Since I didn't get sufficient
interest to get a team in, I am back on the WorldMasters Tournament Management
Committee again.
Our latest flap was where we (by a very narrow 3-2 margin) voted to support
a GM who wanted to rollback a season when he forgot a player request for a
deadline extension.
But in general, things seem to be going PRETTY smoothly for a tournament that got
way overwhelmed with 73 teams of 7 players, for a total tournament player roster
of 511!!!
Toby Harris has completed another record first round 18 center victory, gee
I wonder how THAT happened?
And now, I'm facing Toby and others in another "Boasters" game, designed to
hold interest between Rounds 1 and 2 of the WorldMasters Tournament.

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby

My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.

Dear Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just received <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> today. Thanks for the dedication-I 
really appreciate it.  So far as we know, the baby has 3 heart conditions 
which will need to be addressed with surgery after he is born:  Ventricular 
sceptal defect (a hole between the 2 ventricles); double outlet right 
ventricle (both main arteries coming out of one ventricle instead of both 
ventricles); and pulmonary stenosis (the Pulmonary artery is too large). 
<i>((Yes, Paul told me, but I really was hoping we'd hear it from you.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been seeing a pediatric cardiologist, and he has been extremely helpful 
in giving me information about what would be done surgically once the baby is 
born.  I'm extremely grateful that he has been guiding us, and he will be 
overseeing the surgeries.  We really won't know how much or exactly when the 
surgery will be done until he is born.  He is due on July 1st, so my guess is 
that this is going to be one busy summer!  I'm also relieved that my amnio 
came back clear-meaning that there is no underlying condition (i.e. Down 
Syndrome) hiding behind the heart conditions.  Anyway, I really appreciate 
that everyone has been keeping us in their prayers.  Everything will all work 
out the way it was meant to be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi, Jim. My apologies for not getting back to you sooner about the publication
of the game - the business around the baby (arrived today at 10:14 a.m. by
Cesarian section due to breech presentation, at 9 lbs 11 oz) has had me running
around a lot. The baby looks strong and healthy, but he has a full cleft lip
and palate, which means we'll be visiting the Sick Kids hospital a lot to get
him fixed up (more stress...), but the people think that it can be fixed as
good as new, eventually (say, 6 months...) with orthodontic appliances and then
surgery.    
<i>((Congratulations and good luck!!))</i>

quasi-nice way. I'll embed an EMF version of the moves map, which should print
OK (I'll have to experiment with some B&amp;W shading/fill patterns, though I think
we tried that before and found that not much would photocopy well. 8-( ). A
link to the web site should suffice, for those who are interested enough. I
eventually want my game report subroutine to spit out an HTML file for
inclusion on the website, in addition to the text file for mailing... I'll see
if I can think of a subzine name while I'm in the shower tonight (I'm most
inspired while getting ready for bed for some reason. 8-)). It'll probably be
Stooge related. heh-heh.
Gotta get to bed - was up at 5:00, and was in the OR with Jeannine until I
finally nearly keeled over. "Dad in distress" was the call. Fortunately I
recovered after about 15 minutes, but it was nasty while it was in progress...

"Confidence" === a movie     

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie starts with Nick Vig (Ed Burns), the protagonist, on his knees with
a big gun at the back of his head.  The very well dressed man holding the gun
wants to know if Vic's life is flashing before his eyes.  Vic's face looks
like someone has been using it as a soccer ball.  Obviously this has not been
a really good day.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nick narrates, explaining to the audience how he got into the mess.  Nick is
a confidence man.  With him it is all about the money.  He has one simple
rule.  If it starts to go sour, you walk away.  Due to an unlucky choice of
marks, and a partner who needed to pad his self esteem, Vic fell into a
situation that didn't allow the "walk away" option.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nick takes us back three weeks to a scene between him and a very excited man.
Nick has a gun in one hand and blood splattered all over his front.  He's
trying to calm the man down so that they can work together to fix the
situation.  Nick manages to talk the guy into going back into the bar, where
a bloody corpse is decorating the floor.  All they have to do is move the
body before the cops arrive.  Nick can't do it alone.  The other guy doesn't
want to get any more involved.  The bar tender says something.  Nick, still
with gun in hand, argues back.  There is an open briefcase full of blood
splattered money on the bar.  An innocent bystander whines about not having
seen anything.  Turns out the bar tender has a much bigger gun.  Nick's
friend bolts and manages to flee the scene just as the cops arrive.  The
corpse gets up off the floor, and the team splits the take.  The cops (who
really are cops, but not above doing business on the side) thank Nick for
their split and leave.  The next day one of the team, the innocent bystander,
who bragged about his big score to a bookie, is dead, and Nick learns that
his mark was a bagman for a very dangerous crook named King (Dustin Hoffman).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story is the real star in this movie.  It is tight, and it moves well. 
The actors, especially Dustin Hoffman, gave it all the help it needed to make
it really work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Identity" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was made with some very good actors.  The mystery was introduced in the 
beginning, and then we took a leap to a sudden desert storm, flooding, and 11 
people trapped at a small motel.  Then they started dying.  Some were killed, 
some, maybe accidentally killed, clues were left on the bodies, then the 
bodies started to disappear.  When there are very few of them left they start 
to notice that there are some wildly coincidental things about all of them.  
They all have the same birthday for instance.  Very strange, very tense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then, the mystery is explained, and all the tension goes out of the story.  
The story is not over.  Following the explanation comes the rest of the motel 
interaction.  But it was really hard for me to care.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"X2 - X-Men United" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"X2" stands on its own as a movie but relies heavily on the first movie for 
the background story.  If someone saw only this movie they might come away in 
total confusion as to who all these mutants are and how they are connected.  
"X2" picks up smoothly where "X-Men" left off.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`Wolverine', Hugh Jackman, is searching for his mutant roots, only to 
discover that he is more than a mutant.  `Mystique', Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, 
is back as `Magneto's', Ian McKellen, remaining henchperson.  Romijn-Stamos 
has less screen time than her character, seeing as `Mystique' spends most of 
her time in shape change form.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just as `Wolverine' was in focus in "X-Men", `Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler', Alan 
Cummings, was in focus in "X2".  The character on screen is vastly improved 
by the media change.  In the comic book there is a static poof of smoke when 
he teleports.  On screen it is a moving trail as he moves.  He is really a 
great character and was given full development.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`Jean Grey', Famke Janssen, shows growth of her mutant power which I think 
is prelude to "X3".  In the comic book she becomes an all powerful being that 
is corrupted by the power.  Good story line.
<i>((That same story line occurs in the second Star Trek pilot with Gary Mitchell.
It's always been a favorite of mine and I've been missing having much play for
Jean Grey and Cyclops in the first two. 
I think you're right on.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Despite the handicap of having so many characters, the story was coherent and 
moved well.  The special effects were outstanding as always.  Really good 
movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Gee, thanks as usual, Steve, but I'm decidedly underwhelmed by the movie
offerings in recent months.
I'll tell you the movies out there that I would go see right now, none of them
earthshattering, but all really good entertainment: Holes, Bend It Like Beckham,
and especially A Mighty Wind.
I think I've said a little about Holes and Bend It Like Beckham in previous 
issues.  
Both movies are cute, with memorable characterizations. 
They have stories.
A Mighty Wind is a parody comedy, so I was surprised to find that it too was
cute, with REALLY memorable characterizations.
I was blown away by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara in this movie..... beyond
how the whole thing was laugh out loud hilarious.
Levy and O'Hara of course have known each other for thirty years.
I grew up in the 70's watching them on their Second City TV show.
In this movie, the characters that they play are meeting after being apart
for years in a reunion concert (for those that don't know the premise it's
about folk music and a 2003 reunion concert for three groups).
I can imagine during shooting O'Hara slapping Levy upside the head and making
him stay in one character and not flopping all over the place chewing scenery
like he usually does.
I found their chemistry electric and the backstory was played for laughs of course,
but they were honest, deeply honest.
It could only come from deep within their own pasts with each other.
Seriously, they won't get any consideration, but I'd think Academy Awards - it
would be good to give them for something like this once in awhile.
Fred Willard was incredibly annoying.
I wanted to boot him off the movie, and then boot him again, but that was
part of the charm!
Christopher Guest of course also writes himself into the movie and he's
great too, but Levy and O'Hara grab the movie.
Guest has more pathos, perhaps even bathos, and adoration for his characters,
not as mean spirited as some of his other films have been.
But that's a good thing.
I laughed, a lot.
Oh yeah, and reminds you that Catherine O'Hara is really the sister
of a reasonably famous folk singer, Mary Margaret O'Hara, and if
you've never heard Mary Margaret sing, you've really missed something.
One of the most unique voices that you'll ever hear.
Well, Catherine has real musical talent too.
But, this offers me the opportunity to plug one of my favorite records
of last year too, Mary Margaret's "Apartment Hunting" soundtrack.
A nothing movie with a great soundtrack.... actually I don't know
anyone who's ever even heard of the movie, but the soundtrack is a keeper.
I don't know if the soundtrack for this movie will be worth much,
but the movie's a keeper.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Speaking of unique singers, one of my other favorite singers at the present
time, Erin McKeown, is about to release her next album, called <b>Grand</b>, and
you can check out more about that at erinmckeown.com.
In some more exciting news, she is hooking up for a short tour with Ghod
June 30 - July 6 in England/Wales/Scotland.
She's playing Northampton, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, and Cardiff.
Anyone of my Brit subbers who goes and writes a review for <b>TAP</b> gets
literally ANYTHING you can think of that I can give you..... I will be
eternally in your debt.
Ghod is of course Richard Thompson for those who didn't know.....
this really is amazing, but not surprising.
Erin has been living here in Providence for the past few years
and I run into her on the street or in the pubs occasionally.
Erin has this fascinating turn of her guitar that is a cross between
jazz and folk that is unique, plus she has a gravelly world wise
sort of voice, not pretty like Mary Margaret O'Hara's, but unique
in its own way.
Check it out and buy the new album, it's going to "break" her, I'm sure.))

((I'm finishing up the issue now, let me just get to the half page and then
I can fit in a map or something at the bottom.....
this Big East thing continues to eat at all of us Eastern basketball fans.
This probably means that you'll get six twelve team football leagues formed
VERY fast if the three schools jump to the ACC, with Notre Dame out, and then
you'll have 73 schools (the six leagues plus Notre Dame) who play six league
championships and then Notre Dame, the six league champions and one other team
will get into an eight game playoff.
You'll see it by the end of the decade.
And who really cares about big time college football anyway???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARON to THE ASSEMBLED MEDIA):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Baron von Blurbist: Thank you all for attending this
news conference. You guys have been ringing the phone
off my hook and digging up my lawn with your broadcast
vans. So I figured I might as well come clean about
the events that occurred during the Balkans Leadership
Symposium in Muncie, Indiana, last week. So let’s get
on with the questions. You in the front with the gravy
stain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gravy Stain: Stanley Kowalski from World Conflict
Weekly, Baron. Can you confirm that you met briefly
with Sultan Tim at the conference?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Yes, I had hit the open bar pretty hard during
the first day reception party, and instead of
attending the "Bulgaria: Keyhole to Constantinople"
conference, I decided to drive over to "Girls, Etc."
and see if Claudine Cleft was showcasing. As I
stumbled out the hotel door, Sultan Tim grabbed me by
the arm.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GS: And what was the nature of that conversation?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Sorry, I’m getting a buzz from this microphone.
Did you ask what sort of establishment is "Girls,
Etc."?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
GS: No, sir. About the nature of the conversation with
Sultan Tim.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Oh, I see . . . Ummm, well, I was too drunk to
really focus on the words themselves, but I think the
gist of it was a peaceful transfer of power in
Bulgaria. I slurred something in anger and pushed the
Sultan away, but I later found a fruit basket in my
hotel room with his name on the card, so I guess no
hard feelings. You with the canker sore.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Canker Sore: Jamie Tyrone from Modern Mayhem, Baron.
Rumor has it that the Italian ambassador has not paid
you an official visit in years. Is this true?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Sorry, you need to speak up. My head is throbbing
something horrible. Did you ask how long I’ve
suspected I’ve had a drinking problem?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CS: No, sir. About the last contact you had with
Italy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Funny you should ask. I could have sworn I saw
Pope Dan at the strip club, so I weaved my way over,
stuffing ten-dollar bills into the pants of anything
that moved on the way. I plopped down at the table
with this guy and I kind of got into his face. "What’s
your problem?" I screamed. "I offered you Greece, I
supported you in Munich, and you dis me! You dis me!
It’s because I’m funnier than you, isn’t it? Admit it!
It’s just goddamn jealousy!" Well, right about then,
the bouncer gave me a chop on the back of the
neck-—guess I had my hands around the guy’s throat or
something—-and I was crumpling into unconsciousness, I
noticed that the guy I was screaming at wasn’t Pope
Dan at all. I think it might have been the bathroom
attendant. Real old, frail guy too. Sheesh, I must
have been hammered out of my mind. You with the
mismatched socks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mismatched Socks: Willy Loman from Armageddon
Annotated, Baron. Does your support of the German
attack on Munich spell the end of France’s hopes
against the Anglo-German alliance?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: I’m sorry. There’s an air conditioning vent right
over my head. Did you ask the name of the woman who
ordered $500 worth of champagne and oysters from my
room at three in the morning?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Whoops, I guess YOU can't coach the Alabama 
football team....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MS: No, sir. About the impact on France of the
Austro-Italian war.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: You see, that’s just what I was telling Claudine.
She was teasing me, saying that if I was such a
hotshot world leader, I should have taken her to the
French Embassy for dinner instead of ordering in. And
I said, first of all, the French would probably spit
in the oysters after what I’d done to Italy—not that
you’d notice it with oysters so much. Second of all, I
said, I can’t walk around the French Embassy with my
shorts around my ankles and Vaseline on my nipples,
now can I? Yeah, you, the one whose mother still cuts
his hair.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mother Still Cuts Hair: Eugene Jerome of Trench
Warfare Today. Baron, do you believe you’ll have cause
to regret your decisions regarding the betrayal of
Russia?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Let me tell you something. Sure I regret some of
the decisions I made. But I was positive that the
leather bustier and matching crop were legitimate
expense account items. And I was as shocked as the
next guy when I saw the news about the altered birth
certificate. And the bail money being counterfeit has
got nothing to do with me. I mean, do you guys ask
everyone who offers to bail you out if they’re
convicted felons? Okay, well I hope that clears up all
your questions. But I just want to say I think you
media guys are just a bunch of vultures if you ask me.
With all the important things going on in the world,
with all the legitimate concerns you should be looking
into, you got to crawl around in the mud looking to
destroy a guy’s reputation. Well, enjoy it while it
lasts, because you won’t have Baron von Blurbist to
kick around anymore! Now somebody get me a goddamn
drink . . .

1) It turned out that Jody and Jim were having problems reaching my E-Mail
address, see the top of the szine, as my ISP spam protection program 
ratchets up a few notches.
I eventually got their orders, after adjudication but before they had
seen the results.  
I can show people time stamps if they want to verify any of this with me.
As a result, using these orders received with them not seeing any of
your orders, I have readjudicated Fall.
Thanks to Phil Reynolds and Dan Gorham for volunteering to standby.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LONDON OCT 31, 1911): Saint Edward (sanctified by the Pope) has 
abandoned his war steed (horse) in favor of a naval vessel (his yacht) 
with which to assail the evil Tretgrendel. "My sword is sharp, let my 
aim be true," swore Edward.

1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Four down, three to go.
Everyone slides down one more country next time to set up for 1905.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper, Sean O'Donnell, Dave Partridge, Alexander Woo, Eric Ozog
and Kurt Ozog are in to be six of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".
But we do need official wings rules, which I seem to be unable to locate.
Can anyone assist me there?
