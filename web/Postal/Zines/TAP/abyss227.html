<p><br><p><br>``Love, Love will tear us apart, again.... Love, Love will tear us
apart, again...'', Ian Curtis as leader of Joy Division, from the
song of that name..... yet:

<p>
``Regrets, yes I have many, but none so great as spurning your love....
cutting life from the hopes of an outstretched hand, 

<p>
``Regrets, our secret cemeteries, where loves and loss are silently lain,

<p>
``The dream is fading faster now, and soon you'll slip beyond my recall.''

<p>
From ``Regrets'' by Anthony Phillips (the original guitarist for Genesis)
on the album <i>Wise After the Event</i>. 
May Ian Curtis rest in peace and may music save lives, not destroy them,
that's MY only regret..... see below.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Merry Christmas and a most happy Year 2000 to all of you.
As you can all see, I did not get the szine out before Christmas and
thus I decided to make it a New Year's Day spectacular.
There is a surprising amount of interesting reading here, I hope.
We should be able to stick with all of our deadlines anyway since
it just moves my Christmas break to the other side of the schedule.
Last issue's warehousey format had oodles of grammatical and spelling
mistakes, I hope this one is better for the break and extra time spent
working on it.

<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.
There will be options for new games from subszines though, stay tuned.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR BRENTON VER PLOEG AND....</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Our next person to search for (who should be relatively easy to find,
since I think I know where he is) is Brenton Ver Ploeg.
This actually is a search with a twist.  
I actually am offering up TWO $50 rewards.
The first reward is finding for Brenton.
The second is for resolving a certain mystery that currently exists
in our hobby for which Brenton is particularly well qualified to solve.
I will share with Brenton ALL of the information I currently have on this
mystery and he will thus have the leg up to get the second $50 reward.
I will tell the first reward winner who finds Brenton what the mystery is
in general terms, so they will have some advantage as well.
There also is one other person (he knows who he is) who also knows what
the mystery is.

<p>
Let's get Kevin, Garret, Al, and ESPECIALLY
Jerry found too!!!  
That's STILL a hint too.
 
<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.

The Abyssinian Prince team currently is doing very well, with one game completed
already in a Board Topping Performance by Jim O'Kelley!
Congratulations to Jim!!
My game is still very interesting but also very touch and go and Steve Emmert 
and Berry Renken are near board topping positions.
The games for Randy Ellis, Warren Goesle, and Buddy Tretick have not gone
so well.
This still has our team in pretty high placing in the tournament standings.
I haven't heard much from Partridge, Weiss, Rauterberg, and some of the other
<i>TAP</i>ers who are in the tournament.
How are you guys doing??

<p>
On the other side of the coin, the GMing as a general rule has been
inconsistent (this happens partly by tournament design) and occasionally
really poor.
This thing has been a nightmare for me and many of the Team Captains and
must be even worse for the Tournament Director as there have been innumerable
disputes - I have over 50 messages in my dispute file and those are just
the ones I have personally been involved in!
For this last reason alone, I shant be around for the 2000 version of
this thing, though I think many of the players have really enjoyed it
so far. 
The GM of the game I am playing in has been stellar, so the game I am
in has gone well, but Buddy, Warren, and Berry have all had problems
to varying degrees with their GMs.
Warren and Berry have had seasons rolled back and replayed and Buddy 
probably should have had one rolled back (if the other two were)
that wasn't.
This despite that nearly universal Postal rule that ``no matter what
the mistake, you never roll a season back and replay it.''
That rule is not in force here.
Berry almost had his game rolled back a full year and a half.
It has been a lesson in a variety of ways, for sure.

<p>
Hi Jim,

<p>
I hope that things are well.
Several items in your last ish spurred me (ie. kicked me in the ass) to write.

<p>
I read with great interest Mr. Andruschak's press concerning his trip to
Mainland China. 12 years ago, I travelled/studied there for 8 months and
found it...how should I say.....like a trip to Mars. His press brought back
a lot of memories, and I thank Harry for that. Gwangzhou is perhaps the
most fascinating city in China. The old architecture is great. Great parks.
And the trip I took from Gwangzhou to Hainan island via tramp steamer was
simply incredible.
Several questions I will write here in a public forum in
the hopes that he will write more about his experiences in <i>TAP</i>. 
I hope that Harry writes more about Mainland China as it is THE place to really
experience something different. You haven't been anyplace until you have
been to China. 

<p>
Harry....when you say the Qingping market, do you mean the snake market
across from the White Swan Hotel? Great place to buy antiques.

<p>
When you were in Shanghai, did you by chance go the Peace Hotel (HePing Da
Fan Dian) to listen to the Jazz music? If you did, did the old timers from
when Shanghai was the Hollywood of the East still play jazz and swing
music? Great place to listen to great music and drink a few (or more) 5
Star beers. That is THE place to visit in Shanghai. Has the Bund been taken
over by KFC and MickeyDs? Did you visit the old foreign quarter?

<p>
Did you change money on the black market? Always a thrill......

<p>
I remember getting off the HK-Gwangzhou train at 5pm, not speaking a word
of Chinese, not having a place to stay, and this old gent gets off his
bicycle and stares right at me as if I had stepped off a spaceship. Oh my,
wanted something certainly different and I certainly got it......

<p>
RE: Octopus's Garden......John C. Breckinridge -
I would like to hear why a game was named after him. I am a collector of
Civil War documents and John C. Breckinridge was a CSA &amp; CP USA (KY) Maj.
Gen. He was at Shiloh, Vicksburg, Stone's River, Chickamanga, Chattanooga,
New Market, and Sec of War. Why choose him for a game name? Just curious.
<i>((Peter can answer for himself, but he was a railroad magnate
after the war for the ``famous'' Lexington and Big Sandy Railroad!))</i>

<p>
RE: Hasbro

<p>
They have now taken over Wizards of the Coast. Does this mean the end to
the best game ever invented....AD&amp;D?  Diplomacy is one thing, D&amp;D is quite
another. I can't stand the thought of 
a mix of the Tomb of Horrors and Snakes and Ladders. 
Thanks for everything.

<i>((Well, feelings about Hasbro as the big elephant around the gaming

Surely, their Computer Diplomacy came out with more flaws than they should

Here's a recent update on all things Hasbro regarding Diplomacy....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rob B.F. (Tue, 28 Dec 1999 14:26:45 GMT)</b> 

<p>
Here's the chronology of AH games and what was said when, to the best of my
knowledge, which should be pretty good.

<p>
At GenCon, we told people that Stratego Legends would be a Nov. release,
along with Diplomacy. Acquire in December. February/March would give us
A&amp;A:Europe and Battle Cry.

<p>
Then Pok&#233;mon kicked in. Sometime in the late fall it was told to us that the
factory did not have enough resources to get to the AH games in order to meet
our schedule. And, due to the fact that an AH game has a forecast that is
somewhere in the neighborhood of 2%-15% of a Pok&#233;mon Xmas release, it is just
good business that those Pok&#233;mon games get produced first. We all knew that
Pok&#233;mon was hot for Xmas 1999 and who knows where it will be in 2 months or 6
months. The AH gamer is less seasonal in his/her purchases and would probably
buy Diplomacy in January, though it will hurt sales not to have it for Xmas.

<p>
This did not go down well with many designers but it wasn't our call and
there was (and is) little we can do about it. I got on the newsgroup sometime
in November and reported this.

<p>
This is where things stand officially. However, there was always the chance
that the factory would get a down shift and be able to produce an AH game
earlier than expected. I never posted this because it isn't really fair to
spread that info since the odds are against it happening. What I believe
happened (and this is conjecture as Mark Foster isn't here right now) is that
Mark heard that the factory was going to be able to put an AH game or two or
three into production earlier than planned, he wrote that in an email to
someone, and here we have the confusion. He was being optimistic and it
didn't pan out. He is not the type of guy to ``bald-faced lie". Not his style.

<p>
I can tell you with 100% certainty that Stratego Legends: The Shattered Lands
went into production two weeks ago. I know this. I have a copy on my desk
right now. Several of my friends got copies from me for Christmas. This means 
that distributors should have them now and retailers should have them soon.
It is ironic that this is the first game out since it has the highest ``doubt
factor" of any of the new AH games. However, my friends, who are gamers, told
me they really enjoyed it. And they are not the type of people to say so to
make me feel better.

<p>
Another fact is that Diplomacy is at the factory, ready to go. The factory is
also closed now for seasonal down-time/maintenance. I am not sure how long
this lasts or when Diplomacy will be produced, but rest assured that I will
share this information as it becomes *fact*. The new board looks great,
several of us played an eight-hour game last week (I was Germany, I was one
of the final four, but lost).

<p>
Acquire, as far as I know, is still a January release. Also, as far as I
know, A&amp;A: Europe and Battle Cry are still slated for March.

<p>
If any of this is wrong, I will report it as soon as know it. Many, many,
many people are on vacation this week and information is hard to verify.
However, this info is correct as of a week and a half ago.

<p>
No one is more frustrated by the delays than the designers working on the
games. Being part of a large game company has its advantages and it has its 
disadvantages. As of right now, the smaller-forecast AH line sometimes gets
short-shrift until it can prove itself. But if it keeps getting delayed, it
is hard to prove itself. A bit of a Catch-22.

<p>
Besides, we're not sure that the games are Y2K compliant. Diplomacy, for
example, keeps insisting that the game start in 1901.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>Now I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll find a commercial service to copy them for me.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.

<p>
To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
a free tape).
Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
That showed the value of getting in early!!
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson ($5),
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
Round 2 E-Mail voters got four chances and were Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch;
they got three chances to win.
Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee (2 votes left), and Andy York; they got two chances.
Round 5 voters were Mark Larzelere, Al Tabor, Jody McCullough, and that's it.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; something from the B-52's;
the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

Before I get to this next comment by Steve Emmert, let me say something of
my philosophy of these sorts of things.
There simply is no ``best of'' for music that is universal.
Music is fundamentally a personal experience.
I don't claim this is the best music of all time, or even the best
music of the last thirty years.
What it was intended to be was (and is, I believe) a group think about some
great PARTY music for DANCING.
What Steverino attempts below (and I commend him for it) is something 
more like what I once attempted as a DJ for my college radio station:
a twelve hour music marathon of the best music of all time.
Somewhere I have my play list..... but it began with a Gregorian Chant 
and ended (this was 1979) with Joy Division's ``Love Will Tear Us Apart"
and Anthony Phillips singing ``Regrets'' from <i>Wise After the Event</i>
(two songs which made a huge amount of sense to me at the time, but....).
This timing issue is a major reason why I did NOT encourage recent music
that may not stand the test of time for this list.
All of this is why I don't do ``stars" and I don't try to make some claim
that this really is the best dance music of the millenium, just that
it was fun to argue about and ideally what we did best was to learn
something about each other in our choices.
Let's learn some more about Steverino....

I have held back, perhaps inexcusably, from joining in the party tape
discussion.  I offer the following input:

<p>
Think back, way back, to when the NBA introduced its Slam Dunk
competition at the All-Star Game.  One of the players originally invited
was Julius Erving, then the greatest artist on the hardwood, and still
one of the greatest poets ever to lace 'em up.  The Doctor thanked them
for the invitation, and said, ``You go ahead and have your contest, and
whoever wins can go up against me."

<p>
Back to the future.  It's 1999, and Jim-Bob Burgess sends ME a zine with
a list of ostensibly great music.  I scan the listings to see what kind
of taste the <i>TAP</i> audience has.  I see some jazz, good; some blues,
great; a tiny bit of classical; some ugly-boy music (Rolling Stones),
but a great untapped potential.

<p>
Jim-Bob, you make your tape, and I'll put it up against mine:

<p>
Side A:  We'll start with classical.  ``The Ride of the Valkyries" by
Richard Wagner, from Die Walkure.  (If that doesn't get your blood
moving, there's a nice mortician down at the Health Department who wants
to see you.)  ``Ode to Joy" by Ludwig von Beethoven, from the Ninth
Symphony.  ``The Waltz of the Flowers" by Peter I. Tchaikovsky, from The
Nutcracker.  And the first movement of Mozart's Symphony #25 in G Minor,
which was the title theme to ``Amadeus."  (The foregoing constitutes
``classical music for those raised on rock 'n' roll"; it is impossible to
be bored during any of this without a visit from the last-mentioned
civil servant.)  
<i>((Perhaps, but none of this would make my list of favorite or ``best''
classical music.
Interesting idea, do you really mean this to be best current ``party music''
that happens to be classical??))</i>

<p>
Before moving completely to jazz, we'll make a stop at
the intersection of Classical and Jazz, George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in
Blue."  That brings us to Scott Joplin's ``Solace," one of the tunes
featured in ``The Sting."  Louis Jordan's ``Is You Is or Is You Ain't My
Baby."  Dave Brubeck's ``Take Five," regarded by me as the exemplary jazz
tune.  And Vince Guaraldi's ``Cast Your Fate to the Wind."
<i>((All great tunes and favorites of mine.
Two of them I played on the aforementioned ``tour of all time great music"
(the Brubeck and the Gershwin, and I wish I'd thought of the Jordan!).
Neat list of music, is that the actual way you would sequence it?))</i>

<p>
Side B:  The Blues beckons.  ``Baby Please Don't Go," both the Muddy
Waters and John Lee Hooker versions.  ``Metropolitan Avenue" by the
Nighthawks.  And on to RnR:  ``Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry (really,
Jim-Bob, how on EARTH can you have a party tape that does not include
the greatest rock 'n' roll song ever recorded?), 
<i>((You COULD have helped us out, this is another one that made my
``great music of all time list'', but no one remembered to mention it here.))</i>
``Can't You Hear Me
Knockin'" by the Stones, ``Dream Home in New Zealand" by The Beat, 
<i>((That 12 inch version of ``Save It For Later'' is SUCH a better
dance song..... really.... but you certainly can have your choice!))</i>
``The Magnificent Seven" by The Clash.  ``Does Everyone Stare" by the Police.
``Come As You Are" by Nirvana, Seal's ``Violet," ``Under the Bridge" by the
Chili Peppers, and last but assuredly not least, ``In Memory of Elizabeth
Reed" by the Allman Brothers Band. 
<i>((Wow, some really neat choices in here!
I wish you had tossed them in for consideration earlier!!))</i>

<p>
Now, THAT is a tape to last you another millenium.  (In truth, only the
first side will come close to outlasting the next century.  In, say, 175
years, no one will be listening to the Rolling Stones, but barring
thermonuclear devastation, there will always be Mozart.)

<p>
<p>
<center>THE TOP TEN FILMS OF THE 1980s (plus 15 Honourable Mentions)</center><br>

<p>
1. Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) (5 stars) -     
D: Woody Allen; W: Woody Allen; Starring
Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Alan Alda, Martin Landau, Anjelica Huston, Jerry
Orbach, Claire Bloom, Sam Waterston.

<p>
Two parallel stories: a struggling documentary filmmaker (Allen), being
divorced by his wife (Joanna Gleason), woos a rising producer (Farrow), who
is also being pursued by the obnoxious but successful TV sitcom producer
Alda; happily married and respected eye doctor Landau considers how to get
mistress Huston out of his life after she refuses to accept the end of their
affair.  The two stories meet in the last scene.
The conclusion-a total triumph for evil, or is it?-makes this the bleakest
of Allen's films, in a ``message" sense, while it is at the same time
hilariously funny.  It is the first Allen film to depict religion in any
sense favourably, although here very ambiguously.  The Allen character is
the most pathetic of the pathetic-Allen-character type, the Alda character
the most vital of the obnoxious-worldling type, to the extent that even a
Woody-character sympathizer must ask here: does Woody *really* deserve the
girl?  Wouldn't she be happier with Alda, obnoxious as he is?
Fine performances by Farrow, Alda, Huston, Landau, Orbach, and Waterston as
a rabbi who is going blind, symbolizing the weakness of goodness, the
failure of religion, or maybe just a rabbi going blind.   

<p>
Other Critical Opinion: Maltin: ``Arguably Woody's most ambitious film,
playing heavy drama against often uproarious comedy, and certainly one of
his most passionately debated". As Maltin implies, not everyone likes it:
says Leon Wieseltier in the New Republic: ``Let me be blunt; it is a matter
of honor to hate this film.  There is not a frame of it that fails to
degrade, to debase, and to demean something precious.  It is the work of a
consumer, a tourist, a peacock, a voyeur, a coward, a philistine, a creep.
It is a stain on the culture that produced it.  I didn't like it." (November
27, 1989).  Pauline Kael: ``The tediousness of Woody Allen's attempt to deal
with weighty questions is that he poses them in conventional, sermonizing
terms.  He appears to be pinning contemporary greed and crime on man's loss
of belief in God.  The movie represents a peculiarly tony form of
fundamentalism." (October 30, 1989).  Kael asks whether Allen knows that
Alda steals the film. [I agree with Kael here, and too wonder whether Allen
knew it.]  Roger Ebert: ``Who else but Woody Allen could make a movie in
which virtue is punished, evildoing is rewarded and there is a lot of
laughter-even subversive laughter at the most shocking times?"

<p>
2. Betrayed (1988) (5 stars) -      
D: Constanin Costa-Gavras; W: Joe Eszterhas; Starring
Debra Winger, Tom Berenger, John Heard.

<p>
The FBI tries to infiltrate an organization of white supremacists in the
American heartland.
Great performances by Winger, John Mahoney as Shorty, David Clennon as
would-be presidential candidate Jack Carpenter, Jeffrey DeMunn as the evil
genius behind Carpenter's aspirations, Ted Levine as the weaselly Wes, who
sniffs Winger out early but after discerning, but failing to convince the
love-struck Berenger of, Winger's ill-intentions.
Great Lines: Shorty (John Mahoney), a kindly and likable half-wit, explains
to Winger how he could get involved with the brutal things that the
supremacists do: ``All I ever wanted in life was to farm my land and raise my
boy.  The bank took my farm and Vietnam took my boy.  I ain't got nothing
left to take."

<p>
Other Critical opinion: Betrayed was widely disliked.  Roger Ebert listed it
as one of the ten worst films of the year.  Maltin: ``Appalling botch of a
film about the stupidest FBI undercover agent in movie history who's sent to
sniff out white supremacists in America's heartland-but falls in love with
her target instead."  Many Americans were uncomfortable with the classic
Costa-Gavras approach in which the subculture of the governing establishment
- in this case the FBI - is depicted darkly, here pretty much as darkly as
the white racist subculture itself.

<p>
3. Ghostbusters (1984) (5 stars) -    
D: Ivan Reitman; W: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis; Starring
Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis.

<p>
Thrown out of their university research positions, three paranormal
investigators set up as businessmen, offering to rid New Yorkers of ghosts
and spirits haunting their abodes-and just in time, as a host of diabolical
spirits from another dimension are just about to return, and their interface
with the present is in Sigourney Weaver's apartment.

<p>
4 of the best comic actors of the 80s, and Sigourney Weaver, the actress of
the 80s, combine. 
<i>((And Sigourney Weaver finishes the 90's with another brilliant comic turn 
in the stunningly hilarious <b>Galaxy Quest</b> that is just out.
This movie is by far the funniest movie I've seen this year.
They took an obvious premise and really just nailed a perfect comic film.
As <b>Ghostbusters</b> clearly was as well.))</i>

<p>
4. Witness (1985)  (5 stars) - 
D: Peter Weir; W: William Kelley, Earl Wallace, Pamela Wallace; Starring
Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis.

<p>
Amish boy Samual Lapp witnesses a murder in the washroom of Philadelphia's
train station, and identifies the murderer from a picture in the police
station: he is a cop. Investigating good cop John Book (Ford) must hide out
in Amish country with Samual's mother (McGillis) when he finds that the evil
in his department goes right to the top. McGillis as a devout but
independent-minded Amish woman confronts the world as represented by Ford
(and, naturally, ends up taking her clothes off.)

<p>
A mainstream-directed movie by the best director of the 80s.

<p>
Other Critical Opinion: Pauline Kael dumped on this movie, asking whether
liberal New Yorkers who could stomach it were aware that it was an attack on
their culture and a defence of the superiority of ``country" culture, as
represented by the Amish.  I think they could figure this out, Pauline.
<i>((I really loved this one too, Alan, thanks for reminding me of it!))</i>

<p>
5. Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984)  (5 stars) -
D: Michael Radford; W: Adapted by Jonathan Gems and Michael Radford from
George Orwell; Starring 
John Hurt, Richard Burton, Suzanna Hamilton, Cyril Cusack.

<p>
A faithful rendering of the classic novel of the 20th century.  Richard
Burton's last film appearance.

<p>
Not particularly well regarded generally, perhaps because it was such a
faithful rendering.  One of the best opening scenes (The Three-Minute Hate)
of any film. Music includes the superb rendering of the national anthem
(``Oceania, 'Tis for Thee"). The film also spawned the good Eurythmics album
``1984", with pieces that didn't make the film, including the deserved hit
``Sexcrime".
<i>((Hmmm, I liked it at the time, but don't remember it well now.
I'll have to rent it again....))</i>

<p>
6.Dead Poets Society (1989) (Four and 1/2 stars) -
D: Peter Weir; W: Tom Schulman; Starring
Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Norman Lloyd.

<p>
A charismatic English teacher at a 50s New England prep school inspires his
students to ``seize the day"; their consequent courses of behaviour lead to
disaster.

<p>
Other Critical opinion: One of the few movies extant which Pauline Kael and
I both like.  Roger Ebert: `` `Dead Poets Society' is a collection of pious
platitudes masquerading as a courageous stand in favor of something."

<p>
7. The Year of Living Dangerously  (1983) (Four and 1/2 stars) -  
D: Peter Weir; W: Peter Weir, David Williamson (novel by C. J. Koch); Starring
Mel Gibson, Sigourney Weaver, Linda Hunt.

<p>
First-time foreign correspondent Guy Hamilton (Gibson) needs the help of his
photographer Billy Kwan-a societal outsider because he is half-Chinese and
a dwarf-to cover Indonesian President Sukarno whose national
self-assertiveness frightens the West.  Kwan even helps Hamilton romance
diplomat Jill Bryant (Weaver). All moves swimmingly until Hamilton's
self-centredness leads him to actions that Kwan considers a betrayal.

<p>
Great Oscar-winning supporting performance by Hunt-I never realized that
the part was being played by a woman. Weaver is at her most beautiful in
this one - and that's saying a lot.
<i>((This probably was my favorite movie of the 80's.))</i>

<p>
8. Do The Right Thing (1989) (Four and 1/2 stars) - 
D: Spike Lee; Starring
Danny Aiello, Spike Lee.
 
<p>
Pizza-parlour owner Sal (Aiello) has remained in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
community as it has turned to a ghetto around him (``these people have grown
up on my pizza") and the parlour, also staffed by two sons-one with strong
anti-black feelings-and irresponsible black employee Mookie (Lee) is now
the only white presence in the area (except for hostile incursions by the
police).  The everyday life of the ghetto is portrayed in stark
actuality-the streetcorner philosophers  who sit on a corner and drink
cheap liquor all day, the Korean convenience store operators whose financial
success earns tham the hatred of the community, the evangelists for Black
Islam, the sheer heat and difficulty of life.  A dispute between Sal and a
customer over a noisy ghetto blaster leads to violence, police intervention,
riot, and death..
Strangely, the Academy, despite its congenital liberalism, denied this
much-admired film the nominations it  deserved-the film and Lee's direction
should both have been nominated, and Lee may have deserved to win.  The film
is seen by some as hostile to whites, but in fact it presents the sources of
black-white conflict as complex; no one is totally to blame.
Much profanity.
 
<p>
Critical Opinion: Ebert: ``it comes closer to reflecting the current state of
race relations in America than any other movie of our time."
<i>((Perhaps this opened up a door, but I think this movie does not stand up
on its own as well as movies that have been made since that address similar
issues do.
I would cite <b>American History X</b>, for one, which is a far better film
and turns some of this on its ear.
You could argue, and you might be right, that other movies would not have
been made without this one though.))</i>

<p>
9. Working Girl (1988) (Four and 1/2 stars) -
D: Mike Nichols; W: Kevin Wade; Starring
Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin.

<p>
Tess McGill (Griffith) is a lower-middle class secretary, whose hair,
dress, accent and language ensure she will never be taken seriously despite
her intelligence.  She wants to work herself into the world of high finance,
and is hopeful when she gets a new boss (Weaver) who she can look up to-a
sophisticated corporate woman and potential mentor.  McGill discovers by
accident, while her boss is off with a broken leg, that Weaver was about to
steal one of her ideas and claim it as her own.  Tess decides to impersonate
her boss and sell her idea on her own-to a mover and shaker who happens to
be her boss's boyfriend (Ford).
Great AA-nominated performance by Griffith, who makes the movie.

<p>
Critical Opinion: Roger Ebert: ``This is Melanie Griffith's movie in the same
way <i>The Graduate</i> belonged to Dustin Hoffman."

<p>
10. Name of the Rose (1986) (Four and 1/2 stars) -
D: Jean-Jacques Annaud; W: Andrew Birkin, Gerard Brach, Howard Franklin,
Alain Godard;  Novel by Umberto Eco; Starring
Sean Connery, Christian Slater, F. Murray Abraham, Michael Lonsdale.

<p>
Monk William of Baskerville (Connery) investigates a series of murders at a
monastery, using deduction, as his brother Franciscans prepare for a crucial
theological debate: should the Church be a worldly possessor of wealth? He
must work fast, because the Inquisitor, who has prosecuted William for
heresy on a previous occasion, sees the murders as the handiwork of the
Devil and all who impede his quest as likewise possessed.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I am open to suggestions on the latter, though I want to print maps and
***I*** don't know how to make the rings rotate easily.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this very soon.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

<p>
1) Note from Conrad von Metzke, The BNC (Tue, 14 Dec 1999 15:53:26 -0800)

<p>
I'm sorry, your first request for a new number arrived on Thursday, when we
are closed.  It was also not accompanied by the requisite $50 and triplicate
Form 493-B (Rev.), so when it was finally noted it was placed in the file
folder ``Things To Do When I Bloody Well Please."

<p>
Fortunately your second request has arrived on a Tuesday, when we ARE open,
and in addition we just happen to be running a special - buy one, get one
free.  So your first request is being treated as the one you bought, even
though you haven't paid, you damn cheapskate, and your second request is the
free one.

<p>
Your free number is 1999K.  Please leave positive feedback at
www.pleaseleavepositivefeedback.com
(I wonder what happens if you actually click on that?)
Best wishes, Conrad
<i>((Well, I had to try, doncha know..... nothing on that, but

of their talent.

<p>

We'll have an update when it becomes available.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(APR 15, 1901): From the outer offices of her shrink Mother Russia bellowed 
for some smelling salts. Her son, the Tsar, misunderstanding her (or 
was it understanding exactly her proclivities) thought she meant smelling 
`salts' (get it? `salt', `saltie'  =  sailor). ``Who would have the 
smellingest sailors?" wondered the Tsar. ``Our first cousin, the King of 
England has lots of sailors. There should be plenty of smelling `salts' 
there." Ever desirous of pleasuring his mother the Tsar immediately 
enquired of the British Ambassador whether something could be arranged. 
Shortly, a letter was posted to Hull, England from St. Petersburg.

<p>
(A DAY IN THE FRANKISH REPUBLIC):
The courier marched up to the Prime Minister and
announced:
     
<p>
``My great and wonderful leader, we have a message
from the German."
    
<p>
``Oui?," the wise one so sagely inquired.
     
<p>
``Yes, sir, he states that his minions who
attempted to move into Burgundy are merely looking
for a better life and he is annoyed with your efforts
to block fair immigration. Also, he applauds the pluck
of the English fishing fleet in the Channel." 
     
<p>
``Oui?," he asked while narrowing his eyes
and squinting at a wart on his nose.
     
<p>
``Furthermore, sir, he made some comments about
your vocabulary."
     
<p>
``My what?"
     
<p>
``The number of words you know and can use. As you
know, I agree that the most anyone needs to know is
2000 or so to get by. Tell me sir, what shall we do
about the German?"
     
<p>
``We fix him. No more dip, uh, dip, uh..."
     
<p>
``Do you mean diplomacy, sir?"
     
<p>
``Oui. No more diplomacy. We will kick German and
English butt without it."  

<p>
(HULL, MAY 1, 1901): A rather curious request arrived today at City Hall. 
It appears that the Mayor has been requested to provide a British Sailor 
for her Imperial Russian Majesty's pleasure. The Mayor (like most 
politicians), seeing an opportunity for pecuniary advancement, offered 
himself instead. 

<p>
(GERMANY-FRANCE): You make Charles Bronson seem like a
raconteur. You even make me seem very diplomatic. Both
are very hard to do.

<p>
(LONDON, AUG 1, 1901): In Parliament, the Prime 
Minister condemned the Italian government for its unprovoked aggression 
against Austria-Hungary. ``All nations recoil in horror and opprobium at 
the invasion of Tyrolia by the Italian Army. Public opinion demands that 
Italy withdraw its forces immediately." The leader of the opposition rose 
to ask, ``Why, then, does the Prime Minister ignore the German aggression 
against France?" Prime Minister John Beale replied, ``The leader of the 
opposition raises a valid point. The government wishes to see all Europe 
at peace. I understand that the Kaiser withdrew his forces so no censure 
of Germany is necessary."

<p>
(IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES): Again the old man of the people arose, and
thundered:
``Austrians,

<p>
 If we must die - let it not be like hogs

<p>
 Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,

<p>
 While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,

<p>
 Making their mock at our accursed lot.

<p>
 If we must die - Oh, let us nobly die,

<p>
 So that our precious blood may not be shed

<p>
 In vain; then even the monasters we defy

<p>
 Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!

<p>
 Oh, Austrians! We must meet the common foe;

<p>
 Though far outnumbered, let us show brave,

<p>
 And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!

<p>
 What though before us lies the open grave?

<p>
 Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack.

<p>
 Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!''

<p>
(PORTSMOUTH, AUG 15, 1901) The First Sea 
Lord, Admiral Samuel Owen Barfer (S.O.B.) asked Captain Hood, ``What do 
you propose to do with the Kipper?" 
``Sir, to demonstrate the capabilities 
of the Kipper I propose to seek out an enemy ship and sink her with a 
surprise undersea attack. Just name the enemy, sir, and I will proceed." 
Barfer responded, ``Your orders, Hood, are to seek out a French battleship 
and attack without being detected." 

<p>
(DOWN AT THE BAR ROOM WITH SHREEVY):
It was one of those nights that started out quite
well at the Doo Drop Inn. Moving quickly into the
evening's festivities, Shreve launched into song with
Crazy Henry and a couple other fellows, singing
something that sounded like ``Still Hazy After All
These Beers."  I had managed to get into a discussion
with Billy the Creep as to the merits of Mad Dog
versus Chablis, with me taking the part of
unadulterated wine. In all, it began to be the sort of
night that one can enjoy there. However, things were
to change.
     
<p>
It was then that two very menacing fellows strode
into the bar. One was tall with a muscular, Swedish
lumberjack look and the other was of the short,
squinty-eyed persuasion. The big man scowled and
looked around the room, asking, ``Where is Shreevy, the
bum? Do you see him, Frenchie, my boy?"
     
<p>
The short man squinted, farted and stated that he
did not and started staring at a wine glass. 
     
<p>
At that point, Shreve, being neither a liar nor a
coward, but not wishing to press the issue, stated  ``I
know that I seen him just this morning." My guess is
that Shreve was referring to what he looked at in the
mirror when he shaved, which appeared to be
coincidentally that morning. 
     
<p>
``Ya, well, my name is Bjarne Oaklynson and I got
a bone to pick with that feller. Do ya know where he
is?"
     
<p>
``Don't forget me. I'm Sean O'D, the best to be"
roared the short fellow, while trying to focus his
eyes. ``I want to fix the Kraut, too. So where is he?" 

<p>
``Now, that's a good question, guys. I seen him
over at Terry's Place last night."  
     
<p>
``Shit. That's a bikers' bar," muttered Bjarne.
     
<p>
``Big deal, I know how to handle bikers," yelled
O'D. 
``We go in and tell them if they don't give up
Shreevy, we kick their asses." With that, the two
strode out of the bar.
     
<p>
``Sounds like a plan to me," whispered Shreve into his beer.

<p>
(LONDON, SEPT 1, 1901): Newspaper 
Editorials are awash with speculation that the recent Italian invasion of 
Tyrolia and the Franco-German clash over Burgundy are the harbingers of a 
larger conflict. The Ambassador to France has not yet returned to Paris. 
In addition, Parliament has voted to start conscription proceedings as war 
appears imminent.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) No celebrating yet, but I had no notice of any adjudication errors
last time..... however, Robert Stimmel did give me some clarifications and
map errors.
In particular, the map had Ottoman's army in Afghanistan, but it is in
Uzbek, as you can see from the listing above.

<p>
2) Gene Prosnitz has added an E-Mail address.

<p>
3) Someone has asked a question about supports regarding fleets moving
to coasts of multiple coast provinces.
For example, can Adriatic support Naples to the West Coast of 
Papal States?
The answer is unequivocally YES.
This works just like the regular game.
The issue for supports is: can the supporting unit move to the PROVINCE,
not the coast of the province, where the supported unit is moving?
And, yes, you can do this.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GM to SPAIN): I know it's a ``big change'' rather than a small change,
but I actually think the biggest problem with the map you drew is how
small Europe is relative to the number of provinces in it.  
I, for one, would go for more distortion and easier reading.
Probably you can't do that without starting over though.
No map this time, but you'll get another map with the Fall results.
I think it will be helpful for game watchers and players alike to
get an overview of the board and whose units are where.

<p>
(LISBON): General Chaos has overthrown the King.
He will be kept as a figurehead.
General Chaos announces the following:

<p>
(1) An alliance with Attila the Hun, which should profit us in 
middle Europe.

<p>
(2) The sending of spies pretending to be English to form an alliance
with the Iroquois to fight the French Indian allies.

<p>
(3) A conversion to Buddhism in order to acquire Tibet.

<p>
(4) Founded a fort in Manitoba and named it Fort Vichy.

<p>
(5) Sending mosquitos to the La Salle River.

At least for now.
Scott is not sure how accessible his hotmail account will be,
so treat that as unreliable unless he tells you otherwise.

2) Note that builds and removals MAY be made conditional on the

Autumn retreats and Winter builds and removals are combined.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY-WORLD): My only press is to wish all of you (even you, Boobness)
a heartfelt best wishes for a happy holiday season and a wonderful
upcoming year.
Sometimes life is just damned grand.
Oh, yeah, don't count on any mail you've sent to other than my present
address actually making it to me.
Sorry, that's just the way-o-things.
This is s'posed to be my last move till my move... home.
<i>((And best wishes to you as well and my fondest hope
that this next move happens very, very soon!))</i>

<p>
(MOS-ANK): Thank you so much for your kindness and generosity,
Oh Merciful Sultan....

<p>
(GERMANY-FRANCE): I'm just keeping you honest; I have no plans to attack France.
I would prefer to explore cooperation between us.

<p>
(MR. BRANDO-ENGLAND): An army in St. Petersburg?
What have I done to deserve such disrespect?
<i>((No inside knowledge here, but a betting man would not bet
against the proposition that said army will not survive the Winter season.
Too cold for them??))</i>

<p>
(MOS-BER): You're steaming along quite nicely.
When the time comes, I'll happily support you into Norway.
<i>((Your sense of timing appears a bit off again....
I hate to clue you in, but that's YOUR center now....
your position appears to be recovering.))</i>

<p>
(TRENT-GAME MEISTER): Has anyone ever studied the correlation of
press quality to the quality of play?
I don't know if I write better press when I'm losing but I definitely
get a bit more cynical and sarcastic.
<i>((A bit more confused too ;-)
Not to my knowledge.
I know I tend to write better press when I am FULLY engaged in the 
game or when I am completely out, not when I am on the sidelines of
the action and losing.
But everyone is different.
Finally this game is getting a decent load of press!
Keep it up!!))</i>

<p>
(GENERAL COMMENT FROM NO RUSSIAN PLAYER IN PARTICULAR): Italy in Galicia?
Hello!
Did we start playing Black Hole Dip and no one told me?
France, Austria, c'mon now, folks, bust a move or something.
Open up a big ol' can of Industrial Strength Whoop-Ass!!!
<i>((Brave words from a man whose smooth Polish butt is barenaked
and vulnerable to said Italian.
As for the French and Austrians, ummm, I think a judicious ``no comment''
is best.))</i>

<p>
(TRENT-JIM): I'm not getting much attention for my 'zine.
If I find someone to host it as a subzine do you think I'd get a better
audience?

<p>
(JIM-TRENT): It's unfortunate, but the answer is probably yes.
Paul Kenny is hosting the LA Diplomacy game that you are guest GMing.
You might want to ask him about expanding that arrangement into subszine
status.
Personal opinion on my part is that Paul's szine and your subszine would
be an excellent match....
I have been getting a large number of postal inquiries lately,
many people of whom are getting this issue of the szine as a sample.
Who has game openings and is looking for new players??
Unfortunately, I'm not for some time, except for the Star Trek opening.
My suspicion is that there is the demand for a few more postal szines out
there, but with fragmentation it is so hard for someone like Chris
to get started!!!
Help him out, won't you???  Even just drop him a note of encouragement.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that Sara Reichert has added an E-Mail address.

<p>
2) Heath is clearly not back on ``hobby track'' yet as he NMR's here.
This game has no standbys as Heath's nukes go unfired and his units
all have been nuked by others.

<p>
3) If I get nuked more times than any of you have supply centers,
I win!!!!

<p>
4) Not as much freedom of movement with the multiple
nukes and nukes not fired onto the board.
I don't think Sara will be have as much fun charting out hopping units
this time.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JOHN-SARA): Merry Christmas to you, as well.
Nothing like vaporizing a waterway and making it unfit for man and beast,
fish in particular, to liven up the holidays.

<p>
(SARA-GM): Your nice (and somewhat large) szine was stuffed into my
mailbox on 2 December.
Quite a contrast to <i>Cheesecake</i>.
Oh, and you mentioned John Boardman on Page 1?
Well, I am supposed to have a subscription, but <i>Graustark</i> #701
with a deadline of 5 November has not yet arrived.
<i>((I got 701 a long time ago dated 6 November.... did it ever
catch up to you???))</i>

<p>
(JODY-JIMBOOB): The night you found out that I really was a man, all man, 
is one I recall frequently and with the fondest of memories.  Have a 
wonderful Hannukah sweetie.
<i>((Yeah, right....))</i>
 
<p>
(SARA-DR. LAURA): If I have a crush on a macho dude serving a non-life 
term, does that rattle my boots of Amazon sexism?  PS, I think my spurs are 
knocking.  And I'm not going to answer any questions about what my 
six-shooters are doing.

<p>
(FRANCE to RUSSIA):  I should nuke you just for the ``Dr. Laura" press.
The real Dr. Laura came from the same town I did.  There was much
tittering in Binghamton when nude photos of her from long ago showed up
on the Internet.

<p>
(GUYS to GALS):  So... do you like your ``banana" (reference to Dr.
Laura's demo prop) with the peel removed?  We discussed add-ins for
women so a trim for men is a fair topic.  Do you care more about
curvature or length or plumpness or firmness?  Let's see, Sandy has kids
so we must assume at least one of you two has opinions on this topic.

<p>
(AFTER PUSHING THE BUTTON, MIKE GETS A THOUGHT):  Where does the Indiana
Parole Board meet?  If they conduct business at the Indiana Dept. of
Corrections offices, this nuke could mean there will be nobody left to
authorize John's release!  That would prevent him from touring the
national parks and enjoying time with relatives.  Quick, where's the
``Undo" button? ... What do you MEAN, ``this system has no `Undo'
button"?!

<p>
(ARSENIC ITALIAN to DEAD FRENCHIE): You are wrong again, oh Boobish One.
(Not you, Sara, I'm talking to the Burgessian Bombastier here)
I know all, I see all, and I certainly READ all.
I read <i>TAP</i> from one end to the other.
Don't <i>remember</i> a lot of it, but that's another story.
Calling me a liar is like calling Fassio a gladhander.
Get over it - and quit worrying - I read your rag every month,
and have been doing so since around issue #1.
<i>((It's my world and welcome to it....))</i>

<p>
(SARA REICHERT-MIKE BARNO): Please remember this is a black press game.
I had nothing to do with that press item, allegedly by me,
about ``anxietyship'' and the rest of it.
As an office temp, I hate having to type words like that in
business reports.  (And I have seen worse, much worse.)

<p>
(ARSENIC ITALIAN to CYANIDE SARA): Darling, we have simply <i>got</i>
to get together and poison a game soon.
Let's make a date.
Boob, wanna chaperone?
Mom won't let me go out with Sara alone....
<i>((Not me, I ain't startin' no new games now.
Care to modify your request after my visit to your beautiful abode
and the chance to meet your beautiful wife?
Am I reminded of the Talking Heads song??
Nah.... seriously, I really liked Stephanie.... almost as much as
you like my wife!))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to HEATH):  If you wanna be a big-time (s)zine pubber, with all
the fame and glory that comes along with that [but it doesn't get you
women, you're in the wrong hobby for that], you gotta expect to get
nuked once in a while.
<i>((Especially when you NMR....))</i>

<p>
(SARA REICHERT to HEATH GARDNER): I am the new standby player for France
in the game BORIS XIII, the position you NMRed out of in Fall 1903.
As of Spring 1906, it is England/France vs. Italy/Russia with Germany
squeezed in the middle, Turkey on the sidelines, and Austria just
eliminated in Winter 1905, the first to go (as usual).

<p>
(M.P. BARNO, PhD., MS, S&amp;M - HEATH): Once upon a midnight dreary, the 
nuclear missiles of Three Mile Island perched upon your mantle piece, 
discussing amongst themselves whether to create spermacetti out of your 
Mobius strip or to let your drink wrath from your stein backed with grape 
motifs.  As it was snowing out, the conversation dragged on, until the 
little muffin missus returned from the outhouse, the cabin door opening blew 
the nuclear missiles . . . (where?  up?)
    
<p>
(CZAR-SULTAN): I was so tempted to nuke you and any places you could get 
to, just so that I'd have a chance at being better than someone.  My 
subconscious intervened however since pulling you down won't help me much 
and would make you that much more sympathetic to everyone else - plus, the 
key point, where might my troops go for an extra SC?

<p>
(MIKE to JIM-BOB):  I haven't looked through the Pouch's registry or the
Judge ratings lists, but is the e-mail hobby more gender-neutral than
postal Dipdom's 98 to 99 percent masculinity?  The few bits I noticed in
the past seemed only a bit more sprinkled with women.  Tournament player
lists such as Buz Eddy's latest American Diplomacy Grand Prix standings
(http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Face/ADR/) show similar
almost-all-male numbers.
<i>((Actually, my impression is that the E-Mail hobby is MORE male centered
than the postal hobby, though lately the number of women in the postal
hobby also is down.
This is worth thinking about and discussing more.))</i>

<p>
(SANDY-MIKE): Get over it boy.  I'd say get a grip on yourself, but 
apparently you had enough of that already.  Or, should I say, that you are 
way ahead of us in knowing the solution to the Y2K Jelly problem.
 
<p>
(MIKE BARNO to BOOB): Many people are leery of fruitcakes in New York.
When they find out you think you were abducted by aliens, they treat you
like a weirdo, like you wear unmatched outfits or something.

<p>
(RICHARD-GEORGIANS): Get the tomahawks (missiles and hand-helds) out of 
Georgia, Chechnya, Turner Field, and the Turkish silos.  This is Allah 
speaking.

<p>
(JODY to JOHN): Moving to Tri seemed the safest place. Assuming you did me no
harm, I'll be out next move.

<p>
(JODY to MIKE): If you moved to Pie, you deserved that.

<p>
(CHILDREN-MOTHER): Go blow yourself - up.  Or, as the 7-Up commercials 
are saying, ``7 - UP YOURS!"  You weren't so good at diplomacy with dear old 
Dad, why should we believe you now.  And you always loved little dickie 
best, probably because he is little dickie.

<p>
(HAGBARD CELINE to CONSPIRACY THEORISTS EVERYWHERE): Ban the Bomb!
Up with anthrax!
      
<p>
(JOHN BOY-EVERYONE): In lieu of great press, let me simply offer wishes, 
from myself and my wife Rose, of a wonderful holiday season and fruitful
upcoming year.
May you stay forever young and recall from time to time that life is grand.

<p>
(SANTA CLAUS - SADDAM): You, of all the people in this game, are being 
good and will get a present.  For the rest of you, happy holidays and I hope 
you have a coal fireplace.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to ENGLAND): Feel the pain!

<p>
(MIKE to TERRY):  Yo, better tell your gnomes or gremlins or whatever
(sure they're not kobold miners swapping drinking stories?) that
legendry and mythology are NOT among the resources that create armies
and fleets in this universe.  Finland is NOT a source of useful supply.
I'm sure that in Xena's universe, for example, a really culturally
resonant piece of elven bard lore might inspire peasants and fishermen,
or even mercenary armies and naval forces, to take up arms to avenge a
martyr or save an anointed baby or recover a sacred object.  But not
here-now.

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE):  How long do spelling and punctuation have to wait
in order to overcome ``pure genious"?  Indeed, how long must logic wait?

<p>
(F to GM): I tink da GM is a bit OCD abut speling in my presss. 
Jim You ar sic.  You Must ge Helps.  
We hav a treetment fer this disorder. :)  Misspellers untie against Jim!!
<i>((Oh, go untie yourself!
You and Jar Jar Binks ought to go hang together....))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to PHIL):  How can you suggest that Terry should ``rethink" his
strategy?  I haven't seen evidence of any thought going into his current
approach.

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): You, too, can pummel England!

<p>
(F to I): Scott, please don't start a two front war and attack me.  MY GOD 
MAN, it's the Christmas season!!

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE):
``Zis Var shall continue until such a time zat za Maygars have established
zeir own country in za heartland of turkish lands..."

<p>
RUSSIA TO AUSTRIA: Pick on someone your own size!

<p>
(TURKEY):  Yes, it's unexciting to hold and support.  But it helps teach
Kent the Golden Rule:  ``Any deviation will lead to termination."
<i>((If he and what looks like his Italian ally could have gotten
their act together, you wouldn't have needed no deviation to be
terminated, and that's a fact!))</i>

<p>
(MUMBLED AMONG THE SCRIBES IN THE PALACE OF LIGHT AND GLORY):  ``Well fer
cripes sake, of COURSE the situation is `noht goot' for Austria.  If the
wankin'-spankin' Roman Empire had been ruled by a loony like the
Archduke, it would have fallen in a month no matter how many legions
were under arms."

<p>
(MIKE to DOC):  What?  You didn't want to spend another mile-high winter
shivering next door to the Underpass Inn?  You'll find poached venison
(from these wimpy spoon-fed northeastern deer) doesn't have nearly the
character of poached Yellowstone bison.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) We're all done at this point.
If I have everything straight, Stan Marsh storms across to get 10 points,
followed closely by Mopsy with 8.
Then with A riders first, C riders second, and Cartman breaking the tie
among the D riders: Alessandro gets 6, Christophe 4, and FatAss Cartman
gets the last two points.
This makes the final scores Rick 49, Eric second with 44, David third with
23, Warren getting fourth with the late run at 19, the Designer at 17, and
the Flat Wheelers bringing up the rear with only 4.
Check me here to see that I am right and send in your endgame statements
or last press for next issue!
Rick, the winner, gives the same analysis below.... but we don't want
to trust him, do we??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO., QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO.,
INC.): Profits down $15M this quarter, about what was expected.  All
divisions spending as heavily as possible to make new acquisitions in
anticipation of bankruptcy reorganization.  Sadly, we only see a couple of
small ones on the horizon.  The chairman's 7-year-old niece has been retired
and sent back to 2nd Grade, in hopes that she'll grow up to do better
elsewhere.  So far she's asked for a $4M advance on her allowance, so it
appears that she did learn something from the experience.

<p>
(CHEF - GOZ): Close.  You're missing the fact that the first
tiebreaker is A <font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> B <font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> C <font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> D in terms of which rider moves first.
So, Stan will pass Mopsy, but Christoph Wheelhub will pass Eric
Cartman.  I get 1,4,8, you get 6 and 7 while Eric gets 2,3, and
5.  Logie-Baird can pull even with Cartman at 119, but has no
tie-breakers to pass him, since they are both D riders,
Cartman's other cards are better (only barely) and Cartman gets
to 119 before Logie-Baird does.  Also, more television viewers
know who Eric Cartman is than know who John Logie-Baird is.
The bottom line is you get enough points to pull clear of
the Brits, and the Bunnies are two points further behind the
kids.   

<p>
(GOZ SECOND COMMENT ON THE UPCOMING ENDGAME): Ok, maybe I was wrong...sue me.

<p>
(DAMON to TFWS): Uh, thanks.  Funny, it doesn't LOOK like a six...

<p>
(TFWS - EVERYONE AND ALL): It's been a joy, the press has been
wonderful, I'm not dead last (well, points wise I guess I am),
but that's okay 'cuz life can be grand and my wife, Rose, 
and myself would like to wish all within reading distance a happy
holiday season and an abundant year to come.
See ya' next game.
I'll do much better, I promise.
At least, 7 or 8 points.
Tremble in your bicycle shoes, rascals.

<p>
(BUNNIES-CHEF): We were hoping you weren't planning rabbit stew!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-CHEF): I have repeatedly informed the GM that he has the
choice to publish my press in the Modern Diplomacy Game (where I am
still on the roster, even if eliminated) or in Breaking Away (since
I have a team in the next event), or to omit part or all of it if
he feels it is too long, not appropriate, or simply in bad taste.
He IS The Editor, after all.
We must respect his grey hairs and not overwork him.
What I would really like to do, of course, is buy him a new wheelchair,
and take him to some cliff with an awesome view.
Then push the wheelchair (and him) over the cliff.
Much better GM abuse than just dropping a nuke on him.
Think of the screams all the way down!

<p>
(McGREGOR-CHEF): Congratulations;  it looks like you are going to beat
me by a whisker!

<p>
(GTCO. to NEWTON): Although somewhat strapped for cash, we DO have the $5K
needed for a hitman after the race...hopefully you got enough from Vegas to
hire enough bodyguards to protect yourself.

<p>
(CAMOMILE TEA DRINKERS-FIELD): I was hoping that at least my fourth place
rider would finish before anyone else's, but it doesn't even look as though
I will accomplish that.

<p>
(MOPSY-STAN): Come up here to space 120 and let's duke it out for fourth
place!

<p>
(MOPSY-STAN):  Is a Marsh anything like a briar patch?

<p>
(PETER):  If it hadn't been for the fact that I got the button on
my jacket caught, I think we might have won!

<p>
(BOOB-PETER): I loved it, perfect!!
Too bad you couldn't win too....

<p>
(CHEF - GM): Interesting ESPN.com column by Rob Neyer which
is described as ``MVP voter is a turkey".  Apparently George King of
the NY Post has explained his decision to not include Pedro Martinez
as one of the <i>TEN</i> best candidates for MVP this year by complaining
about the big contract that Kevin Brown signed.  This is the type of
logic which I would usually reward with an `F' if I saw it on a 
Calculus exam.  (Um, in addition to cooking the kids' meals, I
also teach Calculus in my spare time.  OK, I'm falling out of
character, sue me!)  Anyway, last year, George King included
David Wells and Rick Helling on his MVP ballot.  This year, he
put Derek Jeter as #1 and left Pedro off completely.  So, to
relate what Rob Neyer says Dan Shaughnessy said about this:

<p>
``One of three things happened here: 

<p>
1. King changed his mind about the worthiness of pitchers for MVP; 

<p>
2. King thought Pedro Martinez in 1999 was something less than Wells
and Helling in 1998; 

<p>
3. King wanted to stick it to Boston and take care of the Yankees."

<p>
Number 2 seems hard to believe.  Nay, impossible.  It seems clear
that King did #3, trying to game the system by torpedoing the
candidacy of the greatest rival to Jeter.  Ironically, King
give Pudge a 2nd place vote.  He probably figured it was safer than
giving this vote to Manny Ramirez.  Turned out to be a bad choice. 

<p>
It's a depressing time of year for the Boston sports fan.  The
Pats are doing the now-annual Second Half Swoon.  Maybe we can
hope that Carroll gets axed at the end of the year?  He's clearly
the weakest head coach in the division.  If Testaverde had not
gotten hurt, the Pats would be clearly headed for last place this
year.  They may still be headed there, based on how the Jets
and Pats have been playing recently.  Meanwhile, the 
Celtics still have problems with emotional maturity (i.e. how can
they blow so many big leads?)  I suppose the Bruins are the best
of the bunch, but I'm not much for hockey.  Time to wait for
the UCONN teams to really kick into gear.  
<i>((Yeah, go Lady Huskies!!
And yes, Pete Carroll is gone.))</i>

<p>
Final sports comment: I'm tired of hearing Boston Globe writers
moan about how the Celtics were ``unlucky" when they did not get
a chance to draft Tim Duncan.  They had the best chance of all
the teams, that's true, but their odds were only about 1/3.  
A continued belief that somehow the Celtics were jobbed is a
sign of what has been called ``innumeracy".  The odds that the
Celtics would NOT get the pick were twice as high as the odds
that they would.  And once they didn't get the first pick, 
Vancouver was allowed into the mix, so the Celtics didn't have
the best odds for getting #2.  They did get #3, and nobody forced
them to draft Chauncey Billups.  
<i>((No indeed, let's see if the Celtics can get Antoine and Pierce
both acting like superstars at the same time.
Then they have the role players to do the rest.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-BOOB): <i>TAP</i> #226, with an alleged deadline of
20 November, arrived on 3 December.
For that, you deserve some more GM abuse.
However, I am not sure you can print the ancient Greek alphabet, so I will
have to use a modern English translation.
As Usual, the following press may be printed in either the Breaking Away
game or the Modern Diplomacy game.
Or omitted if you feel there is too much of it, or it is not suitable
for being printed in <i>TAP</i>.
<i>((First off, of course I can print <font face=symbol>a</font
><font face=symbol>W</font
><font face=symbol>b</font
><font face=symbol>G</font
>.
Second of all, it's fine, but let's put it all here in the game you are
now starting.))</i>

<p>
(ARISTOPHANES, ANCIENT GREEK PLAYWRIGHT-GM): ``You have all the 
characteristics of a popular politician; a horrible voice, bad breeding,
and a vulgar manner.''

<p>
(ALICE - DESIGNER): After you, sir!

<p>
(LINDA TRIPP-WORLD): I have launched an internet site to solicit 
donations to help pay my legal bills.

<p>
(KINDER, GENTLER FALWELL): As part of my campaign pretending to 
appear to be more moderate to Gays, I now believe that Tinky Winky
will not burn in hell for all eternity, but only during the 
commercial breaks.

<p>
(THANATOS to WORLD): Let me reassure all that we are really a nice team
and just want to have fun.
OK boys, say something inspirational and motivational for the other
contestants...

<p>
``Procrastination: Hard work often pays off after time, but laziness
always pays off now.''

<p>
``Mistakes: It could be that the purpose of your life is only to serve as a
warning to others.''

<p>
``Mediocrity: It takes a lot less time, and most people won't notice the
difference until it's too late.''

<p>
``Pessimism: Every dark cloud has a silver lining, but lightning kills
hundreds of people every year who are trying to find it.''

<p>
(DATELINE WASHINGTON): There was a shortage of turkeys in the Capitol
this last holiday weekend, as they were out stumping in other States
to try out their new campaign slogans:

George Bush: ``He'll Get Tough With What's-His Name''

Donald Trump: ``Voter, Voter In The Stall, Who's The Prettiest Of Them All?''

<p>
(ALICE - ALL): Anyone seen a cat fading in and out?  Chessie's our mascot.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): Last week the LA TIMES magazine had an
article about Jim Svejda, long time classical music disk jockey at KUSC-FM.
I have always admired Jim's integrity.
He alone refused to dumb down his program when the rest of KUSC went over
to ``the NEW! sound of classical music''.
The most obvious result of this new format was the loss of 70% of the
subscriber base.
The less obvious result was that KKGO-FM commercial classical music station
was able to get well established.
This makes Los Angeles unique in the USA, perhaps in the world, of having
two 24 hour classical music stations.
Because KUSC, after almost going bankrupt, went back to, um, ``classical''
classical music.
Although KUSC tends to play more 20th Century classical music than KKGO.
And by the way, I always listen to Jim's ``New Year's Eve Bash''.
This year will be no exception.
Yes, I plan to spend 31 December 1999 warm and snug in my bedroom,
listening to Jim Svejda.
Did I mention that I have copies of all six editions of his book 
<i>The Insider's Guide to Classical Recordings</i>?
Nowadays I support KUSC with a Senior's Membership of $25/year.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``the little machine elf blinked...
...its eyes opened very wide... 
...it opened its tiny little mouth... 
...spoke in a strange new language:

<p>
<i>((Unintelligible.))</i>

<p>
the creature blinked again...its eyes open wide...
it spoke again...the voice had changed from machine speak to the 
deep southern drawl of an American President:...
`Today the principle measure of our wealth is information: its quality, 
its quantity and the speed with which we acquire it and adapt to it...' ''
A Mekons quote of unknown origin.... stolen off the Internet.

<p>
(BRITAIN-GERMANY): You made your move a little early pard.
Now you have an enemy behind you with 5 or 6 potentially dangerous
units out of 8.

<p>
(GERMAN EMBASSY, MOSCOW): The Ambassador announced today that the Armed
Forces of the Greater Reich were not shaken by their sudden retreats on
the Eastern
Front.  ``We were overextended, and could hardly feed our own soldiers
this Winter; much less the poor indigenous peasantry of the region.  We
will leave that
task to the Ukrainian `breadbasket', and will find the fishing in the
North Sea to
be more than adequate for ourselves."

<p>
(SPANISH REPLY): You see me and Heath as far as I know are the 
youngest players in the game 
of Diplomacy and he is 15 and I'm 18 so we'll die around the same time so 
when you guys die I'll win. 
There won't be anyone left to play, but Heath.
<i>((I see, I see....))</i>

<p>
(BRITAIN-WORLD): I will hold at the MAO.
Don't even think it, or ask.
It'll take you way too many game years for too little progress.
As for any other options, I'm game, just write.

<p>
(GERMAN SPY REPORT): We have it on good authority that  
Egyptians plan to lay an oil pipeline from Siberia to Arabia, 
and to corner the market on that commodity.
Humf!

<p>
(JOHN BOY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> ALL YOU GUYS): With all deepest sincerity,
have a really great holiday and an even greater year to come.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Russian concession, BHJFT draw and BHRJ draw are all rejected.
Now here are some highly favored draws with some REAL class.
I'm not taking any more of these silly draws that sound like babies
spitting up!
HJ (Howard Johnson's), HR (House Rules), and HBT (Hobbit?)
draws are proposed.
Please vote with your spring orders on these bodacious proposals.
Oh yeah, I guess I will allow a reproposal of the Russian concession 
as well.
Vote on that with your spring orders too.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TSAR to DUTCH UNCLE): Either you were spoofing my rant at York from
a few turns back, or else you are beginning to know how I feel about
Andy's play.
No communication.... ruination of my plans with Jonas... aimless attacks
north....
Tell you what, Rick - you go find Luke and I'll go scare up Jonas, and
we'll get this game back on track PDQ.
Deal?

<p>
(JAPAN - HOLLAND): Oh, is that Holland down there?! Hey,
howya doing? Good to see ya! 

<p>
(TSAR to DUTCH UNCLE): Never was much good at pop quizzes, but I'll guess
the answer is, uh, you'll get to Arabia more quickly.
Question back at you: who cares?
Is there a dot there hiding under all that sand?

<p>
(OZOGSAN - TSAR): Ah, didn't you forget something last
turn?  Hint- It starts with an `S'. Shall we try
something else? 

<p>
(TSAR - TSULTAN): Watch it, Terry, or I get me a new Ottoman bitch.

<p>
(RUSSIA to HOLLAND): The ``Baby Doe'' doll <i>could</i> be fun if it came
with its own Swiss bank account.
Or if it were part of a Dictators of the World Collector's Set: Buy 'em!
Trade 'em!
Collect all twenty-four!
There's the Africa series, the Europe series, the Asian and South
American series, too!

<p>
(DON to ROLAND): I beg to differ with our Dutch Uncle but, in Diplomacy,
it's always personal.
Fight on.
<i>((Hey, I thought it always was NOT personal..... where did I
go wrong??
I must have missed something, what was it???))</i>

<p>
(TSAR to GM): Hey, in celebration of our army's great victory over China
(now known as New Russia, by-the-way), I have been informed that in my honor
a great Russian river has been named for me.... the Don River.
I could cry.
<i>((Well, exCUUUUse me!
That's as personal as you can get.... and just as irrelevant.))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to BRITAIN): Ready to come to the peace table yet?
Forty years from now, Gandhi may well be trying that civil disobedience
crap on a Russian bureaucrat.
On us, it will never work.

<p>
(TSAR to DESPER-ATE MAN): Repent, desper-ate one!
Soon!
Now!
This instant!
Before it's too late and the Mutant Butler comes to call.
