All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
I believe all three are appearing in this monster issue, along with
the announcement for Rip Gooch's new subszine.
I think <i>Houdini Blues</i> is the smallest at present, but he is
picking up the game that Mark Kinney orphaned plus a new game shortly.
Don has another gripping press edition of <i>Deny Everything</i> out
in this issue, but his game of newbies remains TOTALLY silent.
What's wrong with these people, if they want silent press games, they
should be playing by E-Mail!!!
At least one of them has gone there.
And David is going strong with <i>Tinamou</i> and for the record (see the
web hack of <i>TAP</i> #258 on the web page) Dave ALSO has a Railway Rivals
opening, they'll surely be working off of different maps. 
Now, the one, the only, THE Rip Gooch....

<p>
Jim-Bob: Since you persist in mentioning my name within the pages of the Prince, 
I guess it's time I responded ...

<p>
I've started <i>Diversions</i> in <i>Armistice Day</i> - you'll probably have seen it. 
<i>((Of course I have, but I want MORE Rip Gooch!!!
Dave Partridge and Stephen Agar apologies a given...))</i>
If not, you know where to find it, no doubt.
<i>((Everything can be connected to from http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/))</i>

<p>
I can now start a couple of games (that's absolutely, definitely, strictly 
NOT more than a dozen) in your szine. 
But no more than simple game reports for now. 
Although I now have a home computer, my time is mainly taken up with jobsearch. 
<i>Diversions</i> swallows a chunk of spare time too.
<i>((Understood, whatever you want to do is fine!))</i>

<p>
I have the following maps available. 
Following each in parenthesis is the suggested number of players. 

<p>
Isle of Wight (3 or 4)

<p>
Netherlands (3 or 4)

<p>
Northern Italy Map P (4 to 8)

<p>
Spain Map SP (4 to 7)

<p>
China Mk. I (6 to 8)

<p>
Austria (3 or 4)

<p>
Belgium and Luxembourg (3 or 4)

<p>
Southern Italy Map Q (4)

<p>
South Sweden Map SWE (3 or 4)

<p>
Switzerland (3 or 4)

<p>
I suggest you ask prospective players to identify their preferred map(s). 
<i>((Please do so in writing to Rip!))</i>
If there is a particular favourite not on the list, 
then the proposer will have to supply copies of the map to me.

<p>
If some kind soul will send me the postal rules and a copy of the board, 
I can also run a game or two of Maneater. 
I was going to get in touch with Derek Wilson, 
but I have to choose the right time as he has recently suffered a tragic event 
and probably isn't in the mood to offer assistance. 
<i>((So sorry to hear, I hope Derek gets through his difficulties!))</i>

<p>
Would you prefer that I put a little piece together in the form of a 
rudimentary subszine, or are you prepared to transcribe or paste in 
my game reports? You choose. I guess I could come up with the beginnings 
of a <i>((Ripping Yarns Mk III))</i> if pressed.

<p>
Jim: <i>Ripping Yarns Mk III</i> will take the form of a tiny subszine 
in Word then. The first editorial will explain why it's Mk. III, 
and subsequent issues will no doubt consist of responses to complaints 
about my GMing ... ! 

<p>
My return to the postal hobby through <i>Diversions</i> is renewing old interests. 
It's good to be back.

<p>
Rules are pretty standard, so unless we turn up some total novices 
there should be no problem. I shall be raising such questions as the 
merits of Bus Boss scoring, the technicalities of Leapfrog rules and the 
criteria governing ERP formats in forthcoming issues. But these will not 
have an effect on people joining waiting lists. Clear as mud? Good ... !

<p>
There are a few websites to which I can direct people if they are totally 
new to Railway Rivals. Stay tuned. 
I might be able to send something for inclusion with the announcement.

<p>
We all screamed ``Go Leafs Go!" - so they did ... Fun while it lasted, though. 
Almost as exciting as winning the Olympic golds - and I'm no hockey fan.

<i>((Yeah, it was fun for one of the games that was on at the same time as
the Red Sox were in Skydome to play the Blue Jays.
I was watching the Red Sox game, of course.
And listening to the fans OBVIOUSLY paying way more attention to the hockey
game on their radios and cheering events in the hockey game more than they
were cheering events in the baseball game was great fun.
Of course, Carolina moves on, it looks like finally to get mowed down after 
having their OT winning streak snapped Saturday night.
Oh well, it was a fun dream to have Carolina win while it lasted.
We'll expect to see you next issue here.

<p>
<br /><br />The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!
When the Postal rate increase goes into effect, I'm probably
going to raise that to two bucks, so get renewals in now!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hearby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a ``whenever''.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>

<b>THE SEARCH FOR TOM HURST - AND MARK BERCH IS ``FOUND''</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Last chance to find Tom for fifty bucks!!!  No action on this
at all, but I found one Tom Hurst who is the WRONG one who is at
a California university, why don't YOU find the right one??
Gentle ``are you the Tom Hurst who played Diplomacy'' notes
can't get people angry, can they?  
But, DING, DING, DING!!! Bruce Linsey wins twenty five bucks
for finding Mark Berch and actually getting him to write to me.
It really wasn't difficult since he hadn't moved!!!
Mark needs to know what life has done to the hobby since he left,
feel free to enlighten him.

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals Underway!!

This is possibly the most prestigious and hard fought E-Mail
tournament around (only challenged by Doug Massey's Vermont

with FOUR full rounds.
The final players (with current SC standing, which is what
counts in a C-Diplo based tournament) are:

and he has 5 centers at the end of 1903.

<p>

and he has 5 centers at the end of 1903.

<p>
FRANCE: Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu - Find Joe at janbu of online.no,
and he has 6 centers at the end of 1903.

<p>
GERMANY: Douglas Vaughan - Find Douglas at vaughan4 of mindspring.com,

<p>
RUSSIA: Darren Koch - You can find the Aussie Darren at koch_family of bigpond.com,

The wondrous Peter Richardson pjrich of ntlworld.com is the GM.

 The play is starting to sharpen up now as France is attacking
Italy and Turkey is attacking Russia.
The history of the WorldMasters tournament is that it is not necessarily
THE best player who wins, but the format and style seem to reward effort.
The player who works the hardest likely will win.  
That's one thing you can say about Egg, he always works HARD on the game,
yet he is presently ``losing''.

Mr. Douglas Vaughan is not dark, is not a horse, has never played on cat23,

Mr. Vaughan replies:
Well now, that's strange. Perhaps there's an impostor with the
same/similar name? Or maybe one of the WM99 or WM00 games appeared as a
``cat-23 game"? I know one was conducted on the DP judge, at least until
the judge started doing funny things. Or I could be losing my mind.

<p>
In any event, I have no explanation.

<p>
I would describe my ``history" as FTF games in the dim past (the '70s,
when I was student), then a few undistinguished games on the judges, and
finally a blossoming in the two e-mail championships, with a brilliant
corps of advisers beside me.

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby

I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling

<p>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<p>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the ``current'' as well as an older
version of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

Among the other folks you know who were in Chapel Hill, Adam Silverman 
is probably the geographically closest.  Conrad and Graham Woodring and 
Chris Martin were among the NYC contingent, and I think Hunter Davis 
said he was from Long Island.  Former <i>PILOT LIGHT</i> pubber Kevin Brown got 
a pure zero, but was ineligible as he played in only one round.  Justin 
Thompson won the Brick for pure zeroes in all three rounds he played. 
(And he lost the DipCon bid on PrezCon's behalf, so he had a harsh weekend.)

<p>
Jim,

<p>
As I mentioned on RGD, I've been browsing through back issues of <i>TAP</i>. I've
also looked through back issues of other (s)zines (there is no `s' in
magazine, which is what I've always guessed was the root of ``zine" or
``szine", but I really never looked into it). There have been some dearthly
serious ones, and even ones that were more of a mixed bag; yours is the
most entertaining, even if I haven't heard of some of the things you talk
about.
<i>((Join the club, sometimes ***I*** can't figure it out either.))</i>

<p>
Anyway, in homage to some of the silly press, I'm starting a  &lt; gasp &gt;  judge
game of Slightly Silly Diplomacy, with the intent that people NOT be
serious. If something ever possesses you to try to run a game here in <i>TAP</i>,
I wouldn't mind. I would be intrigued by a gamestart of NYEED, though I
certainly wouldn't promise a victory.

<p>
At any rate, I've toyed with the idea of some sort of e-zine or something,
just as a forum for my own well-reasoned opinions and the rants of those
who wish to send me e-mail; but frankly I just can't justify the effort
these days. I certainly do appreciate that you put the effort into <i>TAP</i>
that makes it such an outstanding piece of contemporary literature.

<p>
Okay, now that my tongue has been pulled out of my cheek, I noticed your
talk about your two jobs. Sounds like you could just give yourself money
and save the hassle, but I'm sure some sort of fair play requirements
would ruin that.

<p>
As a newcomer to the Hobby, I have to say that while the searches are
probably worthwhile, I don't believe that I could contribute to them. I
mean, what if I find the wrong one or something? Besides, I have a hard
enough time trying to find myself from time to time.

<p>
Obligatory music notes: Anymore, I really don't get into the new releases.
The thing that makes that notable is that I'm still in my 20's- so, at
least in theory, I should be strongly attracted to much of the muck on top
40. Frankly, though, it's mostly disposable stuff that doesn't have the
impact on either 1) reality or 2) me. (I do not claim any relationship
between the two.) Having said that, the recent release by U2 proves to me
at least that there ARE still some people able to write meaningful songs
and actually make money at it. Still, hearing that Bono was touring Africa
with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was a bit surreal.

<p>
I could continue, but then I'd just be spewing forth meaningless opinions,
so I'll stop now.

<i>((The szine is a
pronunciation spelling.  There are TWO ways to pronounce the 
abbreviation ``zine".  One uses a hard ``Z" as in zylophone 
and a long ``i" as in hi or hind, so it sort of rhymes with hind.
The other uses a slightly softer ``Z" sound, as in zebra, perhaps,
and a short ``i" sound sort of like zebra as well, or like you
actually pronounce the end of ``magazine".  The harder first 
pronunciation tends to be used in the East, so I lived in 
xyn country (which is how they spelled it to distinguish themselves)
and needed something distinctive to show that I pronounced it the
softer magazine way.  Terry Tallman, the Toadfather, came up with
``szine" and it stuck.  It actually technically is illegal to call
<b>TAP</b> a zine in at least three states.

<p>
As far as finding people, just do it!  I don't know anyone who
minds a short E-Mail like:
``Hi, are you the Kevin Tighe who used to play Diplomacy and knows
Jim Burgess?  If so, he is looking for you.  Will Abbott
PS I'll bet you get asked more often if you are the Kevin Tighe who
was a TV actor, but no, I'm looking for the one who was a Diplomacy
player!''

<p>
If you weren't the one we're looking for, they would just send you
a note or ignore it.  I can't imagine anyone getting upset.
I get these sorts of notes looking for ``another Jim Burgess"
about 2-3 times a year, at least, since I'm easy to find on the web.
Currently, a ``Jim Burgess'' search on Google yields 3810 hits and
<b>TAP</b> is number 1.
I wish I was ``the trained tenor who turned into one of the world's 
greatest Disco DJ's and remixers ruling the dancefloors of New York City''
but I'm not.

<p>
And lastly, if you put together a ``Slightly Silly Diplomacy" game
and wanted to run it here, who am I to say no?
I'd want to see that you have players who really want to play and
I'd want you to run it to <b>TAP</b> deadlines.))</i>

Since you've been carrying all these movie reviews, you came to mind 
when I read this comment on a story about Transmeta's new supercomputing 
cluster:

<p>
`` `...the unveiling of the supercomputer, a Beowolf cluster called Green 
Destiny...'

<p>
Computing legends Bell and Torvalds looked on in envy as the Green 
Destiny blade cluster was unveiled, knowing only the great Li Mu Bai was 
worthy of wielding the blade cluster's power. Upon plugging the Green 
Destiny in, they were appalled to find it had been ``r00t3d" by some 
Chinese hacker calling himself Yu Jen..."

Mark, you are officially on my comp list (so I don't have to do a search on
you if I want to find you).
Being on my comp list is fun for me and essentially includes most of the 
ex-Diplomacy szine publishers whom I am still aware of and where I participated
in their szines.
I haven't done an exact count, but there are probably 20-30 of you, depending
on how I count.
Total circulation fluctuates a lot but presently is about 140 by postal mail.
If you ever feel called to send me money, feel free to do so, but you're 
gonna keep getting this as long as I keep publishing it and I can find you
otherwise.
I also like getting more substantial short notes for publication once in awhile.
Like, you could tell me about some good music you're listening to?
But that's OK.
I think I might stop this and just go completely E-Mail without all of you.
I intend to keep movin' on for the foreseeable future.
Your ranks have just increased by one, as Conrad von Metzke has been added
to the permanent comp list and has folded <b>Costaguana</b> again.
One thinks that this time might really be for good.
I still think that the Hobby is vibrant and growing, but I think one must
have a web presence for long term viability these days.

<p>
<i>((I started off a conversation with Rick Desper with: 
``Did you see my final comments on Survivor..... damn, I had
this feeling that Vecepia would win from the Final Four, 
but back before the thing even started I had her pegged as 
least likely to win, so I couldn't trust myself on that change.  
Maybe I'll use reverse logic to my advantage next time!!!))</i>

<p>
Yes, I saw that.  About all I can say for myself is that I had
it pegged that Vee would easily beat Neleh in a final.  Apparently
she was switching sides through the finish?  Well, I think Kathy
would have been foolish to think otherwise.  At the point she offered
a ``deal" to Vee, she wasn't giving <i>anything</i> to her.  And then
she was the first person to drop out of the final IC.  

<p>
<i>((Celtics in the hole.  They have a chance, but they need to
start playing these games in the first quarter instead of the second.))</i>

<p>
Ugh.  I saw the first half last night.  It was repulsive.  The C's
are horribly inconsistent these days.  They were playing without any
concentration or planning in the first 6 minutes.  This after
falling way behind in the prior two games!  It's hard to watch.
If they don't make <i>major</i> adjustments before game 6, they will
simply lose it and be gone.

<p>
<i>((I watched more of it and I agree.
I do think that they are capable of the adjustments and I hope that I
see them.
I am cautiously optimistic, but I'm always cautiously optimistic, so
what else is new!!??))</i>

<p>
Well, I didn't see any adjustments tonight.  
At crunch time, the Celtics could not figure out how to run their
offense through Pierce and Walker.  Their only adjustment from the
prior games was to unleash Erick Strickland.   
And the officiating was horrendous, but that's not why the Celtics lost.

<p>
<i>((No kidding, oh well.... the Nets were better, no question.  I do
think that was because the NETS improved as the series went along
and the Celtics couldn't do said adjustments.  
I expect LA to win Game 7 and get very, very surprised by the Nets.
The Nets may not win, but LA won't win easily.))</i>  

<p>
Yes, ultimately the Nets were better.  All those high draft picks
are paying off:  Kenyon Martin, Keith Van Horn, Kerry Kittles
make for a strong supporting cast.  I know a good defense always
makes the offense look weak, but the C's looked particularly so
against the zone.

<b>NBA finals preview</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
I think the Nets will surprise some people.  Let's look at the
particulars:

<p>
Center:  Shaq will not be stopped here.  There is nobody in the NBA
right now who can stop Shaq.  The best you can hope for is that he
is held to less than 30/10 per game.  The Nets center, Todd
Maculloch, is no great thing - certainly less of a presence than
Mutombo was last year.  But the difference from last year is that the
Nets are allowed
to play zone, and as we saw in their series vs. the Celtics, they can
do that very well.  I look for a lot of double-teaming here.  Shaq
will still get 30 ppg, but he won't have the kind of 40/20 game which
would simply kill the Nets.  Advantage: Lakers.

<p>
Point guard:  Jason Kidd is playing the best point since Magic was in
his prime.  He easily outclasses Derek Fisher.   Advantage: Nets.

<p>
Shooting guard:  Kobe Bryant vs. Kerry Kittles.  Kittles had a nice
second half of the series vs. the C's, but he's not at Kobe's level.
Kobe needs to have a great series for the Lakers to win.  He looked
weak at times against the Kings.  It will be interesting to see what
Byron Scott cooks up to slow Kobe down.  Still, advantage: Lakers.

<p>
<i>((These three are the obvious givens.
To me the series will be won or lost based on the rest of the players.))</i>

<p>
Small forward:  Rick Fox vs. Keith Van Horn.  Fox plays with a lot of
energy, but Van Horn has more tools, including an outside shot and
some ability to rebound and play under the basket.  Advantage: Nets.

<p>
<i>((Agreed, also Fox is starting to slow down a bit and Van Horn really
seemed to grow into a mature clutch player against the C's.))</i>

<p>
Power forward:  Robert Horry vs. Kenyon Martin.  Oooh - this is
tough.
Horry is such a killer clutch shooter it's frightening.  K-Mart is
a strong upcoming power forward who plays hard all the time and also
has a reasonable jumper.  A definite future all-star.  But Horry has
more playoff savvy than anybody else on the court.  Advantage: push.

<p>
Bench:  the Lakers have no bench to speak of.  The Nets are deep,
with Lucious Harris, Richard Jefferson, and Aaron Williams all
playing quality minutes.  Advantage: Nets.

<p>
<i>((I think that's just right, so that it comes down to that young
Nets bench and Van Horn.
They will determine the series, I think.
And right now, I am confident in them to do what it will take and catch
a weaker Laker team napping.
Winning Game 1 is key!))</i>

<p>
Coach:  Phil Jackson has eight rings.  Byron Scott has a few of his
own, and has shown in the past (as a player) the ability to shut down
any offensive weapon thrown his way.

<p>
The real key in my mind is whether the Lakers will be able to shut
down the Nets' offense.  Because I think the Nets will be able to
keep the Lakers shut down to a reasonable extent.  

<p>
I think the Nets will steal one of the first two in LA, but they will
not be able to sweep the middle three at home.  (The NBA finals with
the 2-3-2 setup gives a much greater home court advantage than the
typical 2-2-1-1-1 setup.)  The series will go at least six, probably
seven games.  The Nets are mentally tougher than the Kings, but would
have to win a clinching game in LA.  Are they up to that?

<p>
I'll say yes.  Going out on a limb.
<i>((Me too.))</i>

``Enough" - a movie

<p>
``Enough" with Jennifer Lopez as `Slim', a woman raised by a single mother, 
not terribly trusting of men, meets her prince charming.  They marry, she has 
his child, and then one night she finds out that `Prince Charming' is just a 
mask that a very driven manipulative man wears.  Just one of many masks.  
Another is abuser.  So long as everything goes his way and she follows his 
rules she will be fine.  His rules allow him to have women on the side and to 
control her every move, but then, he is the man.
Bill Campbell plays `Mitch', the man who decides that he has to kill his wife 
to keep her in line.

<p>
Tessa Allen plays `Gracie' their daughter.  I mention her because she was 
very believable in a complex role.  I think she might be all of five years 
old.

<p>
Noah Wiley late of `ER' plays `Robbie', Mitch's cop friend.  He was evil in a 
sleazy way.  Good acting.

<p>
Slim takes Gracie and runs.  Mitch follows.  He has lots of money so he can 
hire people to trace Slim.  He has an in with the police.  All she has is her 
own innate sense of self and, when it comes right down to it, even more 
driven than Mitch.

<p>
Michael Apted deserves kudos for directing the film in such a way as to make 
the tension and suspense intense with very simple devices of lighting and 
sound.  My heart was pounding more than once.  

<p>
There was a very satisfactory fight scene along towards the end of the film.  
The audience burst into spontaneous applause.

``Insomnia" - a movie

<p>
I love a good story and this one is better than that.

<p>
``Detective Will Dormer" (Al Pacino) and his partner ``Detective Hap Eckhart" 
(Martin Donovan) were sent to northern Alaska to investigate the brutal 
murder of a young girl.  They were not sent because they had jurisdiction, 
they were sent to get them out of the way of a politically motivated Internal 
Affairs investigation.  

<p>
<i>((I liked this story too, much more than I was expecting.
This whole part of the story, not even hinted at in the repeated 
previews of this movie that I've been seeing over the last 6-8
months, really helped get greater depth quickly to the story.))</i>

<p>
``Eckhart" made a few mistakes as a cop and was about to make a deal.  The 
deal would might have opened up an old case that ``Dormer" closed by planting 
evidence.  In ``Dormer's" mind the end justified the means.  His fear wasn't 
about getting caught but about releasing a sick monster back into society.

<p>
A trap is set up.  The killer falls into the trap but manages to run into the 
fog.  A gun fight ensues, and ``Dormer" shoots ``Eckhart".  The killer 
witnesses the shooting.  And the story twists and turns on from there.  

<p>
``Dormer" sees the shooting of his partner as a mixed blessing and curse.  
When he finds the killer's gun he falls to temptation.  In his story it was 
the killer who shot his partner.  His judgment may have been a little skewed 
in that it hadn't gotten dark since he came to Alaska and he hadn't slept in 
a couple of days.

<p>
``Detective Ellie Burr" (Hilary Swank) is a fresh young policewoman a bit more 
than a little in awe of ``Dormer" who has been her hero since she wanted to be 
a cop.  He encourages her to keep looking at the evidence, to look past what 
she thinks she sees.  He's just being a good teacher, part of what he does.  
She feels honored that he would take the time to instruct her, so she keeps 
digging.

<p>
<i>((I thought Swank was very, very good too.  
She had a lot of nuances to work into the role and she did it much better
than just being a puppy dog to ``Dormer''.
There are lots of other smaller characters developed really well in the
story as it twists.
Again, I really thought this was one that the previews [or you might 
think Steve's review] ruins with too much information.
Completely wrong.
Wow on story, which is rare to say about Hollywood these days.))</i>

<p>
``Walter Finch" (Robin Williams) is a small time mystery writer who doesn't 
take criticism well.  In his mind he and ``Will" are linked.  They are both 
misunderstood.  ``Will" shot his partner accidentally, just as ``Walter" 
accidentally beat the girl to death.  He's as twisted as the plot.

<p>
<i>((And this was the biggest surprise, not at ALL what I was expecting.
Plus, they had the ``he'll kill again" thing thinking I was going to
see a serial killer and then find something, well, more complex.
This was the similar trick as in Murder by Numbers, but this is a much
better movie than that one.))</i>

<p>
At no point is this a mystery story.  Everything is presented to the 
audience.  But the story is so well told and so complex that I still found 
myself waiting to find out what was going to happen next.  By the way, I have 
only told you the beginnings.

<p>
<i>((Indeed.  The other thing I thought was interesting was that this was
a remake of a Norwegian movie where the remote locale was in Lapland.
The insomnia was very, very well presented.  Charlotte as a make up
designer said it wasn't Pacino acting, but all just good make up.
I think a lot of it was Pacino.))</i>

<p>
I never underestimate makeup, but Pacino is a great actor.  I think he 
deserves the credit more than his makeup does. 

<p>

<i>((And Charlotte is a make up and costume designer and thinks actors
(much of the time) are less competent than you would think and not too swift.  
It depends where you come at it from.  Myself, I agree with you,
Pacino was great!))</i>

``The Sum of All Fears" - a movie

<p>
Time gets shoved around a bit but then, that's Hollywood.  ``The Sum of All 
Fears" was one of the early Tom Clancy books about ``Jack Ryan" CIA 
analyst/hero.  So the brought in a younger man, ``Ben Affleck" to play the 
role.  He might not have the intensity of Harrison Ford, but then (outside of 
Harrison Ford) who does?  They also set the time of the events in the recent 
past, which means the movie took place later in time than some of the movies 
with the older ``Jack Ryan".  Hollywood magic.

<p>
Ben Affleck did a creditable job.  Morgan Freeman made his role, head of the 
CIA, look easy, but then, he always does.  Bridget Moynahan is drop dead 
beautiful and seems to be intelligent, which is all that is required for the 
future ``Mrs. Ryan".

<p>
It isn't the acting that makes this movie.  It is the story.  Tom Clancy 
told the story in a bit over 800 pages.  Somehow Hollywood boiled that down 
to a script that left out many of the technological details, but left in the 
important parts.  Tension mounts, and it looks very much like the end of the 
world.  Luckily we have ``Jack Ryan" to save the day.

<p>
Maybe not the best movie around, but well worth a look.

<i>((I agree with most of that, but I found the biggest problem with
James Cromwell's President character. 
I think he was supposed to be a bit more ``nuts'' than he actually brought
across on the screen.
I didn't buy all of his actions (knowing they were telescoping helped, but
not completely).
And I say that generally having LIKED Cromwell's performance.
Cromwell's ``cronies'' weren't sufficiently differentiated and they did something
weird with an illness with one of them that I think was handled much better
in the book (not having read it, but understanding from someone who did).
Also, the Jack Ryan as a young guy works best if you take this movie how
this movie is presenting him, without thinking of it against the other
actors or books.))</i>

``Bad Company" - a movie

<p>
This is the other CIA movie that's currently out.  Where ``Sum of All Fears" 
was intelligent this was not.  This was less analysis and much more `cloak 
and dagger' derring do, with Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins as the action 
heroes.  Chris Rock was given all of the punch lines.  Whoever wrote this 
would have done better to let him ad lib.

<p>
Lots of car chases, gunshots, a stray atomic bomb, I think the kitchen sink 
was in there somewhere, too.

<p>
Before this I was not able to say that Anthony Hopkins disappointed me.  
Action hero he is not.  Culp and Cosby did it better back in the ``I Spy" 
days.

<i>((Yeah, the bit in the field with Anthony Hopkins punching the guy
on the roof and falling out the door was incredibly far fetched

On the whole, I ranked them each as fun entertainment not that
much differentiated from each other (this one obviously was played
for more laughs though).  And you are ABSOLUTELY right that Chris
Rock should have been able to ad lib more.  He is working TOO hard
on his acting (I saw too much method there).))</i>

``So I called up George and he called up Jim, I said let's make a deal.

<p>
He said he'd talk to him.  Gonna start a church where you can save yourself,

<p>
You can make some noise, When you've got no choice...

<p>
You told me useful things, what people think of me, I guess I should thank you.

<p>
It's true, then I agree... I'm all alone, I've got no choice,

<p>
I'm all alone, I've got no choice."

<p>
From ``Got No Choice" by the incomparable Mark Cutler, from the CD
<i>Mark Cutler and Useful Things</i>.

<p>
 If you want to submit orders, press, or letters by E-Mail,
you can find me through the Internet system at
``burgess of world.std.com''.
If anyone has an interest in having an E-Mail address listed so people
can negotiate with you by computer, just let me know.
FAX orders to (401) 277-9904 if you let me know in advance to be sure
the fax machine is set up. 

<p>
I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small ``s'' instead of a capital ``S''.
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
I have been getting complaints and suggestions for doing underlines.
Underlines are really hard to do and I've become attached to italics
but I am considering this as carefully as I can.
I tried an experiment last issue but got no comments on it, so I'm
going back to what I did before.
In the experiment, you CAN'T tell on the html web page version
or in the E-Mailed version what supports were cut and moves fail.
I admit it looks a bit better in the printed version, but there you
can see the italics pretty well too, can't you?

<p>
 Standby lists:

<p>
Bruce Linsey, Mike Barno, Dick Martin, Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Glenn
Petroski, Steve Emmert, Mark Kinney, Vince Lutterbie, Eric Brosius,
Paul Rauterberg, 
Heath Gardner, Phil Reynolds, Paul Kenny, Dan Gorham, and John Schultz
stand by for regular Diplomacy.

<p>
Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Phil Reynolds, Jim Sayers, 
and Kurt Ozog
stand by for the Modern Diplomacy game.

<p>
Harold Reynolds was my standby for Colonia and I have had to put him into
the game.
Help, more are needed for this game, maps are provided for free by me....
I really need another person here!!!

<p>
Let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF.
Standbies get the szine for free and receive my personal thanks.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></tr></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
We've got lots of openings in the subszines, check them out!!!
I'll get serious about starting something else here as other
games end.
I plan to start a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy,
as soon as the Colonia game ends.
Early signups for that are allowed.
I know Mike Barno was in the first one I ran here many, many years ago.
Who else was in that game who is still around??
You also can sign up early for the next Breaking Away game, I'll start
another of those as this one ends very soon.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper is the only one signed up for that.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note the CHANGE in Daniel's postal address, very subtle...
note that Chris Lockheardt moved slightly farther, but both
are still in the same postal code.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BARON to THE ARCHBISHOP'S CARTOGRAPHER): From the
latest issue of <i>TAP</i>, I can only conclude that there is
a vindictive quid pro quo in action: no press, no map.
But since Pope Fool and Sultan Tim did submit press,
it seems there should have been at least a subway grid
for Constantinople and a ``Home of the Stars" map for
Rome included.

<p>
(BIGGEST BOOB OF ALL to THE BARON): Perhaps, given my Russian
centered proclivities, I should have provided a map just with
the Russian units on it?

<p>
(BARON to THE ARCHBISHOP'S STENOGRAPHER): I may be
presuming, but when the Archbishop absent-mindedly
interrupts his dictation of the unit positions to read
aloud a newly arrived set of Russian orders, such as
perhaps ``Pru S Bal - Ber Bal - Ber Ukr - Mos," I
believe you are supposed to stop typing.

<p>
(EVEN BIGGER BOOB to THE BARON): Did you try sucking on this???  ;-)
OK, so I suck too....  you and the Fool are really going to rub it in,
aren't you???
Remember, you are scoring up big points from the House Rules on abusing
the GM at least as much as you abuse any other player.

<p>
(BARON to TSAR'S FLORIST): If the Tsar did not notice
that his orders were nailed to the church door, please
send him my regrets and a wreath of lilies to lay at
the gates of Warsaw. If the Tsar did notice and
ordered his troops to about-face, then a dozen red
roses to hide the stench of my opportunism.

<p>
(BOOB to THE BARON): Sure, sure, you dot grabbing fiend.

<p>
(BOOB to RICK): Sorry, and not just about the loss of the Poles.
What's this about proxies?

<p>
(FOOL to RICK) Did Boob ever answer you on that proxy thing?
In any case, I just ordered some of your units around. I used the orders
accidentally/on purpose published in the summer issue. Sometimes it's nice
having a busy GM.

<p>
(FOOLISH BOOB to BOOBISH FOOL): Sure, sometimes it is.
I don't allow Proxy orders.
Anybody can promise anything and change anything, any time.

<p>
(SILENT TURK to the LOQUACIOUS BARON): Sing a song of sixpence, pocket
full of rye, let's go get the Russian, then bake FOOL a pie.

<p>
(BOOB to SILENT TURK): Methinks you might have been a BIT too silent.
The Baron appears to have done some slightly more Austrian centered moves.
Let's see, is the Fool in a gift giving mood too?

<p>
(FOOL to FOOL) Happy birthday to you!

<p>
(SERIOUS BOOB to FUN LOVING FOOL): Great, hope you had a wonderful one!
And I guess that means you were more into gift receiving.
Too bad no one but you was listening!

<p>
(FOOL to FOOL) Why thanks!

<p>
(BOOB to FOOL): If you weren't so busy partying, you would keep your
appointments!

<p>
(BARON to POPE'S SECRETARY): If the Pope is complaining
that his appointment with me keeps falling though,
feel free to blame it on me. I told you last season I
would meet him in the Aegean, but then I changed my
mind at the last minute and decided to meet him closer
to his office. But he wasn't there, so I informed you
I would be at my office this season if he wanted me.
But then I realized there was no pressing business
back at my office, so I decided again at the last
minute to head back to the Aegean to see if I might
catch him there. I just really hope he didn't try to
meet me at my office this season, or else this
appointment might have to be cancelled.

<p>
(BOOB to THE BARON): Well, I'm thoroughly confused, but let's let
the Fool tell you and me how to reach him....

<p>
(FOOL to BOOB and BARON and anyone else who might take a notion to
real-mail me):  Please note the ever so subtle change in my postal address:
24 is now 26. I got evicted from 24 when the landlady decided to put the
place up for sale (and got a really ridiculous sum for it after only a
week or so on the market). But the next door was up for rent, so that
saves me renting a truck, getting to know the neighbours, or the like.
Packing and unpacking was still annoying.

<p>
(FOOL to everyone other than BOOB and BARON and anyone else who might take
a notion to real-mail me): Phone and email still the same.

<p>
(BARON to THE KAISER'S TOURIST BOARD): Your promotions
are proving a little too effective, especially the
``Feel at Home in Munich and Berlin!" campaign.

<p>
(BOOB to THE BARON): Are Munich and Berlin the places to be visiting
next year, or do we need to go somewhere farther away?

<p>
(BARON to LE PRESIDENTE'S TRAVEL AGENT): Trust me,
don't suggest a tour of Sydney anytime soon.

<p>
(SILENT TURK to FOOL): I suppose I should talk to you about not knocking
heads with our fleets. Then again, look at my moniker.

<p>
(FOOL to TIM): Do exams ever end? You seem to have joined the ranks of
those not speaking to me.

<p>
(TURKEY to BOARD): Did you know, at some educational institutions (names
not being named) it is possible to take a final before you have
completed all your midterms for the term. I didn't, until yesterday...

<p>
(BARON to SULTAN'S PROFESSORS): Please slip the
following telegraph into the Sultan's Blue Book:
``Still waiting for letter. Stop. Fear you cannot
afford the postage. Stop. Will relocate to Bulgaria in
hopes of lowering the rate. Stop."

<p>
(BOOB to THE BARON): I think you might have gotten his attention,
but sent him further into the dream worlds....

<p>
(SILENT TURK to THE STATISTICAL RUSSIAN and/or BOOB): You got a deal, do
my stat homework, and I'll put my nukes away ... woops, wrong variant.

<p>
(BOOB to WAYLAID TURK): I'll really bet you DID have them now.

<p>
(BARON to THE KING'S FIRST FIVE DEGREES OF SEPARATION):
Do any of you know Marcus Hellyer? He is my new
neighbor and he is Australian. I thought I could give
Marcus a letter for the King and he might pass it on
through you guys. Let me describe Marcus in case one
of you does: He is a History of Science professor at
Brandeis University; he has appalling affinities for
weak beer 
<i>((An Australian who likes weak American beer??
Say it ain't so!!))</i>
and the Red Sox; 
<i>((At least he has SOME taste.))</i>
he never played a game of
catch in his life until I talked him into buying a
glove, now he is waking me up at eight in the morning
and dragging me out at eight at night because he can't
get enough of the sound of horsehide on leather; he is
obsessed with Playmobil, a German-made version of Lego
that thrives on the toy marketing formula: very
expensive + hard to get = obscenely profitable
collector's item; and he bears me some small prejudice
because I dared relocate from the ``blue recycling bin"
part of town to their ``gray recycling bin"
neighborhood, a class transgression he discovered when
I put my recycling out on the wrong week. So, does he
sound familiar?

<p>
(BOOB to AUSTRALIANS): I think we need to talk.
Do you have decent musical taste?

<p>
(FOOL to BOOB): I will write you that review for Musical Box eventually.

<p>
(BOOB to FOOL): I quake in my boots waiting for THAT one!

<p>
(BAD PRESS MAESTRO to BOARD): so sue me, it's 3 am...

<p>
(BOOB to BAD PRESS MAESTRO): Well, double sue me back, it's 5 am as I am
typing my replies.... it probably was around then that I was setting up
this game last time, serious apologies to Rick!!
I'm really, really, really sorry, Rick!!
Aside to everyone else: Has he figured out why yet??
But, at least we DID have some decent press and some back and forth this
time.
Perhaps I should make mistakes more often.... with the Baron's orders this time.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Damn, if there aren't more ``hold'' orders this turn than I've
ever seen in a game in 1904, at least in the southeastern part of
the board!
Well, that shows the way that certain diplomatic aspects of the 
game are sorting out at present, doesn't it?

<p>
2) Note Matt Sundstrom's second E-Mail address.

<p>
3) Not that it much mattered, and I'm sure Doug saw the handwriting
on the wall, but I didn't get Austrian orders.
Thanks, Doug, for being here.
Hope all is going better for you!

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SUNDSTROM-WORLD): Hey...new home email.  mattandzoe of directvinternet.com.
Can't wait to see what happens once my wife happens across dip email.  Any
pointers?  bbdoch address still works too.  

<p>
(TURKEY to ITALY):  You need to talk a lot more.  Was I supposed to do
something this season?

<p>
(BERLIN to ANKARA):  Prepare the jihad, please.

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND):  We need to talk a lot more.  We both see this the same
way.  We should figure out what to do about it.

<p>
(EDINBURGH CASTLE-MOSQUE HIGH ATOP CONSTANTINOPLE): Maybe not the whole nine
yards, but one small step?

<p>
(BOOB to PATIENT OBSERVERS): I know this game looks like nothing is
happening, but if you JUST read these next four notes, what would YOU
guess is happening?
You would be wrong, at least I think you would be wrong.
Nobody tells me anything, so what would I know??

<p>
(EDINBURGH-MOSCOW): any love from Russia?
happy fall 

<p>
(MUNICH to ROME, CONSTANTINOPLE): I have a very bad feeling about the
Tsar, my friends.  If his blade found my back, it will be over soon for
the three of us.  I urge you to consider acts of self-preservation
immediately if sliced and diced me.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-PARIS): No news is bad news.  I hope it's my change of email that's
thrown things off.  My move is intended to neuter a stab but hopefully keep
options open.

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA):  If you have attacked Germany this turn then you and I
have issues and England wins.

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): How the three messages from Turkey 
make sense in total is beyond me,
except for the prevailing sentiment that you feel ignored in your corner.
Have you thought about a breath mint?

<p>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND, FRANCE):  Gentlemen, is this any way to achieve
peace in our time?  The euro is so going to collapse over this.

<p>
(HEARTBROKEN SCOT-WORLD): ...As his fair French maiden sailed away, she
promised, ``I'll be back before you know it".  He cried, ``write me as soon as
you get there".  And he checked in every day at the post.  But alas, there
was no letter.  He always worried about what might happen on Ibiza during
the summer.  Could his worst fears have come true?

<p>
(BOOB to EVERYONE): I've got it, this is ALL black press and NONE of you
are who you really think you are, or something like that.
Let's get back to baseball, where I'm sure who I'm talking to and about!!

<p>
(CHICAGO CALLING): Yet again I'm submitting orders and proceeding to the best
bar in Chicago, aka Wrigley Field.  Last time, the Cubs got drubbed.  Oh
wait, that's every time.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB):  The Royals are going places?  Where?  Northern Virginia seems
to be the Expos' destination.  Surely you don't think the Royals can compete
anytime this century?  Even money bet:  Wells will not be a Pirate at the
end of this season.  He's too good to stay off of a contender.

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): Well, not this year, but their new manager is really great.
I admit that there are only six real contenders for four playoff slots in 
each league.
I'm still rooting for the Oakland comeback, but only one of them Seattle and
Anaheim makes it.
I think THIS year, the Twins run away with the Central.
And the AL East race essentially is irrelevant, except in fighting for 
playoff opponent and home field advantage.
But it's OK, the Red Sox don't care.
They beat the Yankees anywhere, but can't beat anyone else at home anyway.
They'd rather go on the road!
In the NL, Cinci is the surprise.
We'll see if they can stay in it.  
My guess would be no and the Braves and Cards will be in easily.
The fun race will be the three West Coast teams likely fighting for
two slots.
Everyone knows that I love Barry Bonds and the Giants, so that's where my
choice still is.
And the Diamondbacks are a REALLY mature, classy team.
Sorry, Dodgers, I've always disliked you intensely....

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Thanks for the phone number, Vince, and for taking over with such
enthusiasm!

<p>
2) Dwayne Shreve resigns with these orders because ``summer is here''
and he wants to spend more time outside.
I certainly can understand THAT!
I'm sorry to see you go, you'll keep getting the szine until the game ends.
The new standby is Steve Emmert, who I hope will step in and get this
game onto some plane of normality.
I know it isn't any fun to replace players every turn!

<p>
3) There was an attempt to pass TREG or GRE draws, but both proposals failed.
There are no remaining proposals on the table and seek your hiding map WAY
up above in the szine!

<p>

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BOOB to BERNIE): I think you got TOO close to Shreevy's crotch, he has 
run screaming into the woods and is lost to us.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to WORLD): But Vince Lutterbie returns to the hobby....

<p>
(VINCE to JIM): I will be more than happy to help out as Turkey....
my first position in over 5 years, even face to face.  
I am glad you told me about Bob, I did not know
about the cancer, and I am truly sorry to hear about it.  I'll be rooting
him on from here.
Thanks for the mention of my book....it is listed at Amazon.com and Barnes and
Noble as coming in August, but in actuality, it ought to be ready to go by
mid June.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Mega-mucho-magnified-stupendous thanks to Harold Reynolds for
the new map.
Let us know if you see any errors in the map, but I think the
observers of the game should really be able to follow it now, ever though
the dimensions of the continents are much more distorted in this version.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BEIJING, SEPT 5, 1759):
After the early retirement of Emperor Gordo Acheswang due to illness, his
successor Harro Reynowong has successfully installed himself and his new
administration in the Forbidden Palace. At a press conference today, the
Emperor was asked about changes in foreign policy that have become evident
over the past couple of weeks.

<p>
``Emperor Acheswang was known for his anti-English and anti-Spanish
sentiments, as his direction our our military forces, economic embargos,
etc, in the current global war have shown,'' said Emperor Reynowong. ``My
military advisors and I have been studying the current situation very
carefully, and believe that the writing is on the wall for the
Russian/Austrian alliance. Their possessions in North and South America and
Africa appear to be doomed, and there's nothing that we can do about it.
Although we have had cooperative relations with them in the past, a
continued alliance will not be in the best interests of Greater China, as
the Anglo-Spanish alliance will control the world outside of Eurasia and
would, in the end, be able to overwhelm us by sheer weight of numbers.''

<p>
In a bizarre incident, a reporter asked ``Is it true that Confucious says
that `man with hole in pocket feel cocky all day'? Or that `man standing on
toilet is high on pot'?" The man was quickly hustled out of the room by
security personnel, cursing in Russian the whole way. The Russian Embassy
had no comment on this incident, but was &#223;tudying the situation closely''.

1) FRET and FREGT draws are proposed.

If anyone has any questions about the way this works, or what your
vote on file is, just ask.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA TO ENGLAND): The point was to possibly buy you and Roland
more time to move into a proper stalemate position! But given
your continuing thanklessness for my thoughts and actions, I'm
now just going to sit back, hold my part of the stalemate line
and watch you two buffoons give this game to Turkey!

<p>
(RUSSIA TO TURKEY): Strange, but I'm kind of cheering you on,
Bruce. Do your damnedest!

<p>
(RUSSIA TO GERMANY): You're a buffoon, too, Mike! (Didn't want you
to feel neglected!)

<p>
(RUSSIA TO ALL): I will not vote for a draw including Germany!
Crush that stray army, Bruce!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'll let you guys figure out who the press below is from or to.
Then again, some of you are very clear about who you are in the press.
This ``crossover'' between countries Winter season is confusing, isn't it.
I hope all of you have figured out the rules by now.
I don't think of them as hard, but I guess they are if you weren't paying
attention to the last game.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): On the one hand, my 15 year old adopted cat, Pearly, 
is doing well. In fact, she probably eats better then I do. On the other 
hand, I am still having hot flashes. On the gripping hand, I am filing for 
bankruptcy. It's been an interesting few months and the next few promise to 
be more of the same. Now, who can I take out my frustrations on? Come to 
think of it...

<p>
(JIM-BOB to HARRY): Hope it works out for you, sounds like you're getting some
good bankruptcy advice from your follow up note.
And good to see one cat working out.

<p>
(DISGRUNTLED POSTAL WORKER - KARL MULLER): First you nuke my traditional SC of 
Holland, then you bounce me from my traditional SC of Denmark? Please e-mail 
me pronto, we have some things to discuss.

<p>
(LONDON to CONSTANTINOPLE): Did I forget to write to you?  Um, sorry.  I 
guess you had to be content that I didn't throw nukes anywhere near you.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.
We wouldn't have thought that pack would form, would we?
Looks like Coach Petey the Penguin could be summarily dismissed from
his duties for this tactical error.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ALICE - BOOB):  How about more press without the controversy?

<p>
(BOOB to ALICE): Fine by me, looks like two riders are going to check in
at the finish line next turn, eh?

<p>
(TOM - JIM):  Speaking of press, check out Quinault River in
off-the-shelf.  First item on page 6 should be good for an hobby awards
literature nomination.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to TOM): Remind of that again next Winter/Spring.
I know I won't remember all the way to then.
Too much press to remember.

<p>
(PRESCOTT to GREENWICH):  The way this game is going, any kind of ``pressing"
is welcome!

<p>
(ALICE to CHRISTIE):  I smell the barn!  Meet you at home!

<p>
(BOOB to ALICE): Shouldn't that be that the barn smells you?

<p>
(ENFIELD to BOOB):  Do we have to protest against the draft again??

<p>
(BRUNEL to ALICE):  Please send some advice on tactics!

<p>
(THE BRIT PACK):
I hope the Border Riders are tested for drugs at the end of this race.  I
suspect that, unlike the rest of us, they've not been using them!

<p>
(DANA to DIAMOND):  Are you a girl's best friend?

<p>
(BOOB to DANA AND DIAMOND): You both ended up on the same square and not
too hot in the grand pack reformation.
You tell me who your best friend is.

<p>
(GREENWICH to BOOB):  I inadvertantly NMRed last round and it turned out
better than the orders I would have written had I written 'em.

<p>
(BOOB to GREENWICH): No kidding!
You didn't quite do so well this time, but those might have been about
your best orders.

<p>
(GREENWICH to BOOB):  Okay;  I'll try not to press my luck.

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB):  I bet octopi would make wonderful economisery.

<p>
(BOOB to WHITE MAID): Am I supposed to understand that?

<p>
(TOM - JOHN):  If I understand you correctly, any rider at the head of the
pack, not sharing his space with another rider, is `breaking away' with
a 1 replacement?  A rider with a single empty space between him and the
second place rider has broken away with a 2 replacement, correct?

<p>
<i>((I'm not sure I understood it that way, can I ask for clarification??))</i>

<p>
From my running days, I know - intimately - the psychological advantage
(to the leader) and disadvantage (to the followers) gained by
grabbing a big lead not too far from the finish.  And the reverse
situation of going for one only to find it wasn't gained.  I understand
the two replacement situation - it's realistic.  However, I don't agree
with a 1 replacement when he's leading the pack - provided the pack is
(mostly) right there on his heels.  In the situation where he DID try to
breakaway,  and one or two riders anticipated it (or were trying the
same stunt) and came right along with him - provided they left the main
pack behind - then perhaps the penalty of a one replacement would be
appropriate.  It's a natural consequence of the situation.

<p>
Or, are we both trying to say the same thing?

<p>
<i>((I'm not sure...))</i>

<p>
I am beginning to get more of an appreciation of holding a small (one
or two value) card.  They can come in handy.  But I still don't think
it should be `awarded' to a single rider leading a consolidated pack... 
:)

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/
currently is on hiatus.
I'll try to remember to let you know when it returns.

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
3) Sean asked me for an explanation about ``playing one short''.
Sean could have built two units this turn, but Seville (Sve) was the only
home supply center of his that was open, so he only built one unit.
Thus, he is playing one unit short.

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): Since there is NO press this time,
we'll take a quote break as well.
