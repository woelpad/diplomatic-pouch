<p><br><p><br>  ``Public media should not contain explicit or implied descriptions of
sex acts. Our society should be purged of the perverts who 
provide the media with pornographic material while pretending it has 
some redeeming social value under the public's `right to know'."
- Kenneth Starr, 1987, <i>Sixty Minutes</i> interview with Diane Sawyer;
courtesy of Rich Goranson... I know, I know, it's all too easy and
everyone has the right to change their minds!
I got a little kick out of it anyway.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>This issue I have ``cleaned up'' a number of old game materials.
I still will accept any comments on the three recently ended games,
but they leave us with this much slimmed down issue.
Lots of unusual game delays too!
Sorry there is so little action in here.
I hope it will pick up next time.
Note that I do have another regular Diplomacy game open, plus my
trolling for interest on Colonia VIIb.
I know Conrad von Metzke believes that this szine is more E-Mail
than postal in flavor and he disparages the ability of the ``postal''
hobby to survive, but I still disagree.  I think the ``flavors''
of Diplomacy are going to evolve in terms of TIME between deadlines.
Where ``pure'' Internet games run on 48 hour deadlines, I think there
will always be a market for longer games and SOME of that longer game
market will be generated by people who prefer postal games.
And the ``personality'' of games that comes out with those longer
deadlines ultimately will be associated with that length of the
deadlines instead of whether the game is postal or E-Mail.

<p>
<b>THE DEADLINE FOR <i>TINAMOU</i> IS NOVEMBER 10TH</b>

<p>
People who play long deadlines will expect vehicles like this
one, or preferably ``prettier'' vehicles like <i>Costaguana</i>
or <i>Graustark</i> or <i>Greatest Hits</i>, where personality,
serendipity, and a wide exchange of ideas takes place.
As the great economist and recent Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker
says, ``people are not all equally patient'' and varying preferences
will lead to varying speeds of games.  Since people tend to become
more patient as they invest in patience generating activities (OK,
OK....) and as they gain wealth and get older, what ``we'' old
patient people need to do is to figure out how to deal with the 
natural fact that the young people are going to be more attracted
to 24 and 48 hour deadline E-Mail games and thus their energy
is mostly lost to us ``old farts'' - Heath Gardner remains the
refreshing exception that proves the rule.  One (old) man's opinion....

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
I am going to defer rate increases for the moment, but
only until the current series of game starts is completed.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Dan Stafford is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your

Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a

Greetings,

<p>
Some of you have come to Diplomatic Incidents before.  Some of you are just
close enough that I thought you might be able to come this time.  Some of
you publish szines and I'd greatly appreciate your help in spreading the
word about DI and of course hope you might come too.  On the weekend of
October 17th and 18th we will be gathering at the Weston Hotel for 
Diplomatic Incident X!  It's two days of Diplomacy and other games and a
lot of fun.  We always have enough Diplomacy for anyone who wants to 
play and we usually have other games as well, such as civilization, titan,
axis and allies, magic, whatever you might be interested in and want to
bring.  So, come and join us.  Bring your friends and spread the word!

<p>
Where:  Weston Hotel, Boston Ma

<p>
When:  October 17,18  11:00 AM

<p>
Who to contact:  Dave Partridge, rebhuhn of rocketmail.com, 603-882-3523;
        
<p>
 Jack Sinnott, jack_sinnott of hboc.com, 617-424-9073.

<p>
We'll be in the Lobby/Meeting/Bar area of the Westin Hotel. Don't
bother calling them as this is strictly informal - we're regulars.     
You'll see the boards out by the big windows overlooking Dartmouth St
and HealthWorks Fitness Club. 
<i>((I know this sounds a bit weird, but they let us hang out there 
and it really works.
We look in the windows of the Fitness Club and they look back at us.
Your guess is as good as mine as to which thinks which is the stranger....))</i>
Food &amp; beverage is available at reasonable (for Boston) prices - plan on about 
$10-15 each for a late lunch/dinner plus soda/chips, more with beer/wine. 
Coolers are *not* welcome.

<p>
Best bet is PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

<p>
BY AMTRAK, COMMUTER RAIL &amp; MBTA (except Green Line):
Get to BackBay Station (all Amtrak &amp; MetroWest/South MBTA trains stop
there, or get on the Orange Line at North Station.) Exit on Clarendon
St. Stare at Neiman Marcus. Glance right towards street lights. That's
the Westin Hotel, above Turner Fisheries. IF IT'S TOTALLY FRIGID
OUTSIDE: there's a way to get to the Westin without ever going
outside: find the stairway going down the head of which is across from
the T turnstiles; this will lead you to a passage beneath Clarendon St
which emerges into Copley Place and which, after meandering up a steep
escalator and around to the right at Gucci then down past Sharper
Image and thru the HabitTrail ends up at the Westin Lobby!

<p>
BY MBTA - NORTH or GREEN LINE:
Get to Copley Station. Walk 1 block down Dartmouth St. between the
Boston Public Library and Copley Square - you'll see Trinity Cathedral
&amp; the Hancock Tower on your left at the other side of the square. The
entrance to the Westin will be across the street. Go up the escalator
and wander around 'til you see us.

<p>
CAR: Best parking is at the Weston. The shops can validate.
<i>((But it is still expensive if you stay all day....))</i>

<p>
FROM WEST:
MassPike (I-90) to Copley Square Exit. Hotel/Garage is in building on
immediate right after emerging from exit tunnel. Circle the block 'til
you see the entrance.

<p>
FROM NORTH/SOUTH:
JFK (I-93) to Storrow Drive. Storrow to Copley Square exit. Bear right
at exit onto Beacon St. Bear left at 2nd light onto Clarendon St. Bear
right at 6th light onto St.James Ave. (landmarks: Trinity Cathedral &amp;
the Hancock Tower - you will drive between them after you turn.) The
entrance to the Westin is on the left after the 2nd light, across from
the Boston Public Library and the Copley Hotel.

<p>
N.B. - there is another garage across from the Hard Rock Cafe on
Clarendon St. 2 blocks past St. James Ave &amp; the Hancock Tower. It is
adjacent to BackBay Station. Prices are cheaper, but I don't know who
validates, so... just remember, there is more legal street parking in
the North End or around Faneuil Hall than in Copley and the average
ticket these days is $25.00 and they can give one every two hours!

<p><br><p><br>
<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
Then, I'm going to set a slate of 20 or so (perhaps more at the rate
my thinking is going) and DEMAND votes from you out there.
I may get a bit obnoxious on that score as the great freedom to work and play
will generate a responsibility to offer some opinions as we near the end of
the century.
I intend to have a lot of fun with this, and hope all of you do too.
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; ``Planet Claire'' from the B-52's;
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

<p>
This time I decided that ``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton goes on
the list.
Clinton is one of the backbones of dance music trends from the 
late 60's through the present.
After some thought, I think I agree with a number of <i>TAP</i>
writers that ``Atomic Dog'' is the most essential song.

<p>
The ``bullpen'' is the list of suggestions that people make
that I haven't decided whether or not to include yet.
Comments on the bullpen are, of course, actively encouraged.
I also am ``working'' on some ideas Mark Luedi tossed out recently.
I put Gatemouth in the bullpen for now, but he will be joined by
others from that list soon.
I know I want ``Gloria'' on the final list, but I want to find a
memorable recording (for me, the best live version I ever heard
was by Dan Stuart, at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel in Providence,
as the Mayor's office was trying to close us down because 
Hurricane Gloria was approaching back in the 80's.
He had told them ``one last song'' and that last song must 
have lasted for about 20 minutes with lots of audience participation!).
I liked Mark's ``criteria addition" that:
``One of my own criteria for truly great songs is that it can sound as
good or better distorted as not, whether on account of poor signal, bad
speakers, tape deterioration, car noise.''

<p>
BULLPEN: ``Rocking the Casbah'' - The Clash; ``Dancing With Myself'' -
Billy Idol's Gen X; ``Walk This Way'' - Run-DMC; Prince - ``1999";
``Fire on the Mountain'' - the Grateful Dead; Devo - ``Whip It"; 
B Movie - ``Nowhere Girl"; B-52s - ``Give Me Back My Man" or 
``Rock Lobster"; ``Roadrunner'' - Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers; 
Strunz and Farrah - ``Americas''; Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown - 
``Up Jumped the Devil''; David Bowie - ``Fame''; ``party at ground zero'' by
fishbone; ``Tweediee Dee'' by Lavern Baker <i>((Wanna explain that one,
Stan??))</i>.

<p>
SPECIAL GEORGE CLINTON BULLPEN: ``I Just Wanna Testify'', ``Let's Take
It to the Stage'', ``The Pinocchio Theory'', and ``Flash Light''.

<p>
SPECIAL ROLLING STONES BULLPEN: ``Satisfaction", 
``Paint It Black", ``Jumpin' Jack Flash", ``Get Off of My Cloud''. 

<p>
SPECIAL DRUG MUSIC BULLPEN: ``Cocaine'' - Eric Clapton's version;
``Casey Jones'' - the Grateful Dead; ``Red, Red Wine'' - UB40;
The Toys - ``Smoke Two Joints''; ``Panama Red'' - New Riders;
``Smoke, Smoke, Smoke (That Cigarette)'' - Commander Cody and His Lost Planet
Airmen; and I'm adding this time ``I'm an Okie from Muskogee'' -
Merle Haggard.

Hi Jim,
Finally got a computer (a retired 486DX2, free from my employer,

<p>
Well, I have a few minutes before work while I'm downloading something so I'd
thought I'd send you one of my typical scatterbrained, disjointed letters. 

<p>
Hasbro: As you know I've been one of the people reading the discussion on
rec.games.board and rec.games.diplomacy about the Hasbro takeover. I really
wanted to write an eloquent informed opinion on the subject, I really did. But
there is no way I could have put better and more intelligently than Keith
Ammann did in <i>TAP</i>208. He echoes my opinion almost perfectly.

<p>
Music: Frightening thing heard recently on the radio: Aerosmith covering the
Shangri-La's ``Walking in the Sand." Its so bizarre to hear that song sung with
THAT voice.

<p>
Jack McHugh's letter: Does Steve McKinnon read this? 
<i>((I don't think so.... you know, I have very, very few new subbers
from the existing hobbyist fringes, I guess they have tried me and ``not
liked me" some time back and never try again.
I know in the past I have sent Steve letters gently ridiculing his attitudes
toward <b>Voyager</b>, but I've done the same thing to Louise and she still
speaks to me.
By the way, I still think that <b>Voyager</b> is the lamest series in the
Star Trek continuum.
I like some of the characters, but the series is lame.))</i>
He is one of the most
rabid George Washington fanatics I have ever known. Lee was able to fight off
other Union generals for two years (remember, he did not take command until
Joe Johnston was wounded) for many reasons. 1) McDowell, McClellan, Pope,
McClellan II, Burnside and Hooker were utter incompetents. McDowell just
wasn't the man for the job, McClellan was paranoid, Pope was an old fool,
Burnside refused to take the advice of his subordinates and Hooker had no
confidence in his own abilities or that of his army. Meade knew how to defend
but he did not know how to press his advantage. Grant was willing to do what
no Union general was willing to do; fight a war of attrition. All Confederate
generals still had their minds in the 1810s; you had to utterly destroy your
enemy's army in order to defeat him such as what happened at Austerlitz. All
Union generals had their minds in 1848. All those frontal attacks were a
direct result of the victory at Chapaltepec. No one until Grant truly
understood this war's unique circumstances and technologies. He was willing to
sacrifice hundreds of thousands of troops because he knew that was what was
what was necessary to win the war. 
<i>((Well, not QUITE that many. I believe the generally accepted figures
for the entire war are 183,148 casualties for the Union and the 122,482 
casualities for the Confederates.
An elementary student in Wisconsin has a neat little web page about this:

<p>
http://danenet.wicip.org/heron/greatblue/itfigures/civilwar.html

<p>
 It might amuse you for a few minutes....))</i>
Call him a 19th Century Zhukov. Grant would
have never made the assault on Marye's Heights like Burnside did or run under
pressure as Hooker did at Chancellorsville. But he would have aggressively
pursued the ANV while it was retreating back to Virginia after Gettysburg.
Meade still had two corps which were in very good shape after the battle
(Sedgwick's VI corps and Slocumb's XII corps). They only gave token pursuit
to the retreat, although they did manage to kill yet another general that Lee
desperately needed (Pettigrew). 

<p>
Steve Emmert's letter: Alan Parsons might qualify as drug music. I always
tripped out when listening to ``Tales of Mystery and Imagination." And ``Eye in
the Sky" was our theme song when I was at NSA. 
<i>((Wow! 
More closet Alan Parsons fans.... we just grow like weeds...))</i>

<p>
<i>Tinamou</i>: I am very scared now that my old friend Dr. Bob Dowrey is reading
this drivel. He still owes me a game of Fortress Europa from 1982 or so. I
wonder if I still even have the game. If space and propriety permits I should
tell you what I and his brothers did to him for his honeymoon...
<i>((Oh, please do, please do....))</i>

<p>
Titanic: The boat sank, get over it.

<p>
<i>eBENZENE</i>: Some of Mark comments sound like Erica Jong's on a special a few
months ago. ``What a turn on it would be to swallow the presidential come," she
said. I'm still trying to figure out two things: 1) What in the bloody blue
blazes does Lewinsky have to do with Whitewater (this IS what Starr is
allegedly empowered to investigate) and 2) Why did Starr violate the law when
he released Grand Jury testimony? If this were a real court case instead of a
political dog and pony show it would have been declared a mistrial long ago. I
assume that you saw the quote that I sent you from Starr regarding sex in the
media. Seems that hes forgotten it. Another fun Starr note is that he has
taken over a half million in legal fees from a private group which is
supporting the Wisconsin government in its upcoming supreme court fight
regarding government vouchers for religious schools. The Wisconsin government
violated the 1st Amendment and <i>very specifically</i> violated the Wisconsin
Constitution when it passed the law permitting it. There is no way it can
possibly fly in Washington. The Supreme Court has been pretty consistent on
ruling that government money cannot go directly into religious coffers.
Indirectly (in the forms of liberal tax exemptions for mainstream religions
and not-for-profit status) government will always financially support
religion. So much for our highest law... 
<i>((My favorite Starr story that to me shows a whole lot of things
about the man is the one about where he conducted one of his job interviews
for one of his assistant prosecutors in this investigation.
He likes to say what a great family man he is and he likes to mix business
and pleasure.
He met the interviewee at Princeton and conducted the job interview while
touring the Princeton campus with one of his children who is scouting out 
an undergraduate school.
This is a man who does not like to waste time.))</i>

<p>
Bill Paxon's heir apparent seems to be Tom Reynolds of Springville (the town
where I was born). Reynolds is the Assembly Majority speaker and is expected
to win in the very largely Republican 27th New York district in Congress. But
scandal has hit him as well. Recently the Assembly passed an special bill
permitting him to enroll in a pension program that they knew he did not
qualify for. Cost to the taxpayer, $1.5 million. Not a smart thing to do for
someone who wants one of the most prestigious districts in the country. He
also did not even make a token appearance when Southern Erie county was hit by
massive flooding a few months ago. He was too busy working on his pension
deal. 

<p>
Do you know that for another election there is not even one candidate for
governor that is from the upstate counties. Yet another four years of rape and
pillage of upstate by the NYC power bosses regardless of who wins, just like
the last 100 years have been. Depressing.

averages too.  does anybody *ever* perform better than their numbers in

like tettleton who goes from .300 one year to .250 the next to .200 the

<i>((I commented to Eric on The Mekons latest album, <b>Me</b>.
``The best songs on the album are among their best songs in some time.
But they aren't making music like the <b>Retreat from Memphis</b> days
any more.  I don't know if you would like it or not.  It is
unique and won't let you walk away from it as background wallpaper.''))</i>

<p>
It wasn't like <i>Retreat from Memphis</i> was a great album; it is a good album,
although it has some dog songs.  But it is way better than <i>I Love Mekons</i>.
<i>((Sacrilege, sacrilege!!
Call out the dogs!!))</i>
I'll ask my brother to record Me for me.

<p>
<i>((I'm actually pretty upbeat, just tired!))</i>

That's cool.  I need to go out on a forest fire to clarify my mind.

I've traded cars with the baby sitter - she's got a sprained ankle and needed
an automatic transmission - so I've got a car with a tape deck! Drove accross
the bridge today listening to Mekons compliments of the Jim Burgess 1995 Top Ten
tape. It was very nice. 
 
<p>
Btw, I've read <i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i> and if you want to read Acker I'd
suggest starting with something else...maybe <i>Western Lands by Burroughs</i>.
<i>((You know, that's good to hear, because I liked the CD, but did NOT like
the book at all.))</i>
Seriously, <i>Pussy</i> isn't her best. I've probably liked 
<i>Kathy Goes to Haiti</i> best of the 4 or 5 that I've read and <i>Pussy</i> the least.

Let me know if you need a gratuitous Pussy quote and I'll dig one out.

I'm interested in guest GMing for you once my last RBM game ends.
<i>((You know there are two people who can have anything they
want regarding this szine, the two of you who go back the farthest
and deepest with me in this hobby, and that is Bob Olsen and you.
You don't even have to ask.))</i>

<p>
You would be proud of Kurt and me-Kurt visited us here about a week ago
and he and I took a trip to downtown Seattle one day to go up the Space
Needle.  Starting on the way home-now picture this-here are the two Ozog
brothers, wearing their sunglasses, cruising downtown Seattle in my
ghetto cruiser (the '78 Mercury Cougar XR7), playing The Mekons Rock 'N'
Roll really loud and singing along: ``Late one night the club was heaving,
I saw a vampire move across the floor, old and white with a silver cane,
lusting for youth through the mirror...I saw a world where the dead are
worshipped, this world belongs to them, and they can keep it" and ``Poor
Ollie North, down in the subway dealing drugs and guns, turning little
liars into heros, that's what they've always done."

<p>
Regarding the postal versus the electronic version of <i>TAP</i>. The E version 
is just fine, though a hardcopy would be nice if I'm in a game. 
<i>((Ah, and now you are, welcome back!!))</i>
However, even if I'm in a game I can certainly live with the E version.

<p>
I guess what I'm saying is that if you wish to send me the postal version I
don't mind (and will put it in the Alamo Archives). However, I understand 
the costs involved in mailing a postal version (and in being a pubber) and
don't want to burden you unnecessarily.
<i>((No problem, I KNOW that the postal people read the szine lots more
than the E people do.
The commentary back to me is at LEAST ten to one.
That does it for me, I want the szine to be read!!))</i>
 
<p>
And, another music related comment, I'm trying to inventory my music. At
work I can play CDs on my PC when I'm working. So, I've decided to try to 
play through the CD collection and create a database of what I own. Of
course I'll need to do the cassettes and LPs here at home.

<p>
As I've recently started it, I can change what I do. I'm curious about
whether it is better, as a rule, to make the listing based on ``artist,
title, medium, label, date" or being more precise by listing individual
titles. One CD brought this to mind. It is a single CD by the Mexican
Symphony and includes portions of pieces by three different Russian
composers. Is it better just to list the anthology or to make three
separate entries for the three composers or be more detailed by listing
each movement? Your thoughts, ideas and such are very welcome.
 
<p>
Thanks for <i>TAP</i> and your supportive comments!!

<p>

<i>((I have some of your same problems 
as I also categorize my classical music by Composer.
HOWEVER, I do not group composers alphabetically but I group them
by style and period.  Thus, all my Russian Composers are together
and then I usually have a small section of ``crossover" records
with the Russian composers that would include your example.
All such problems are not addressed that way, but not surprisingly
most of them are.))</i>

<p>
Well, when I went to sleep the Sox were up 1-0.  When I woke up they'd
lost 2-1.  So be it.  They didn't have very much hitting (strange for
a Red Sox team) and they had been using mirrors all season for the
pitching staff.

<p>
I was glad Jimy decided to use Schourek in Game 4.  A lot of the
critics of this decision just don't understand the problem.  Who did
they want to pitch in game 5, if Pedro had pitched in game 4?
Wakefield?  Wakefield has been awful lately, and Schourek was
pitching very well recently (and he pitched as well as anybody could
have asked him to yesterday).  

<p>
Yesterday I sent a letter to Rob Neyer at ESPN saying

<p>
1) Starting Schourek was a good idea

<p>
2) He was wrong to criticize Jimy for brining in Eck in game 3. I
pointed out Gordon had not been great in non-save situations.

<p>
I was glad to see game 4 back me up with #1, but sad to see it also
justify #2 a little bit too.  

<p>
I've read that Duquette wants to get another top starter.  While that's
great, the Sox will have major hitting woes if they don't resign Mo
and they continue to get below-average output from their outfield.

<p>

<center>Rick, desper of math.rutgers.edu</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I agree with every word of that.
It's a pretty concise summing up of another Red Sox season.
I'm not sure if I want them to make a Florida Marlins move for
one year or whether I want them to grow this team slowly.
Next year I expect to be another year like this one.
Let's finish up with some more whining by my favorite
whiner, Steve Emmert.
He praises me for how quickly the thick enveloped szine
got to him, but I commented on how much money I save
with the smaller envelopes.
He responded as below, but when I told him the cost
[about $100 a year more] he did not reply....))</i>

<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Emmert (Wed, 23 Sep 1998 12:25:36 -0400)</b>

<p>
The envelopes are too expensive?  What kind of an excuse is
that?

<p>
Well, Jim-Bob, how 'bout if I help you with that.  How many
such envelopes would you need in a given month?  Maybe I
can be your supplier.  I would, of course, expect some
advertising consideration, kind of like they've done with the
college football bowl games.  You know, ``The Abyssinian
Prince, brought to you by Steve Emmert."  (Naah.  Too long.)
``The Steve Emmert Abyssinian Prince."  (Better, but still
unwieldy.)  ``The Steve Emmert."  (I like it.  Snappy, hip,
with-it.)

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>I think it is likely there will be another regular game started.
I have interest expressed from at least two or three people in 
addition to the people below.
You also can send your $15 for your life of the game sub and
game fee with NMR insurance now.
Kent Pollard ($15),
Jim Sayers $20), and Kurt Ozog are on the list so far.
Jim is from Australia and I will let his crisp twenty give him the
life of the game sub and all even with the higher postage.
Jim is on E-Mail, but I probably should warn pure postal players
that he is in the game.

<p>
I am trolling for players for Colonia VIIb.
I have direct interest expressed from David Partridge, Robert Stimmel,
Paul Rauterberg, and Stan Johnson.
Could we firm that up in the next few issues, please?
I am still looking for ideas on what I will need to know to run Colonia.
At this point, I will be running it WITHOUT printing a map in the szine.

<p>
On another front, I'd really like this Black Hole game to start too!
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I STILL am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
Conrad von Metzke is the editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117.
Conrad is discussing folding this service.
I think actually it needs someone to pick it up with a web page
where it can be posted.
I'd like to nudge Jamie McQuinn into talking to Conrad about taking
it over and putting in the postal section on <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i>
page, where this szine also resides.
I realize that I should probably volunteer to do this since I'm the most
active contributor to that page, but I'd really rather not.
What we need is for the postal openings to be accessible on the Net.

(IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL):  We
have decided to lighten up just a tad on some of the Islamic
restrictions around here.  First, violations of the ban on the
use of alcohol are hereby lifted, but only for first-rate bourbon
and single malt scotch.  (You've got to draw the line
somewhere.)  Second, the diplomatic moratorium on
correspondence with infidel European powers will terminate
as soon as we hear something constructive from their
embassies.  Courtesy will be treated with courtesy; veiled
threats will be answered with scimitars.

(ANKARA to LONDON):  (Tee-hee!)  Hey, buddy, I think I have
something that belongs to you.  You left it - um - behind in
Suffren.

(ANKARA to BOARD): I just had a physical last month, and my
doctor patted me on the head and said, ``Good boy."  Any of
you who refer to me as ``the sick man of Europe" will get a
copy of my cholesterol count and a punch in the nose.

<p>
(ANKARA to BOARD): The Defender of the Faith has announced
the hiring of two new military consultants, Orville and Wilbur
Wright.  They say they're working on some sort of flying
apparatus, and hope to have the damn thing operational by
December 1903.  By the spring of '04, we will have a
full-fledged air force, and will bomb you guys back to the
Stone Age.  This whole project is, of course, very hush-hush,
but I thought you should know what's in store.

http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
2) Welcome to John Schultz who takes over for Jonas Johnson with
this turn.
Jonas has resigned from all his games and is leaving the hobby,
at least for the moment, to deal with work and other issues 
outside the hobby.
We wish him the best of everything!

<p>
3) For those of you watching this game from the general readership,
note that there was a ``correction'' errata issue on this game,
quoting from the game notes:
``I put one of Poland's fleets on the map in the wrong place. 
More seriously, Paul Rauterberg sent me an update to his orders
two days before the deadline. 
I received it prior to the deadline, but in an egregious GM error,
I misfiled the orders.
I probably would have found them if I hadn't had orders on file.
Thanks to Paul for pointing out the error to me, I would have 
noticed it eventually as I cleaned up my E-Mail, but this way
it gets announced more quickly!''
Anyone else interested in seeing the errata sheet can either check
out the Web page or ask me directly.

<p>
4) John Schultz has some kind of emergency problem of indeterminant
severity and origin.
I know I am praying for him, I hope he doesn't need it.
This is a warning that I might delay the game by an issue if I haven't 
heard from John by the next deadline.
If any of Paul, Jack, or Brad (the Philadelphia Three) really want to
be the next standby in line, they should alert me ASAP.  

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``I only know that he who forms a tie
is lost.  The germ of corruption has entered his soul.'' - Mekons
stolen from something they once read somewhere.... put in here by
someone who has that ``germ of corruption'' since I actually LIKE
wearing ties....

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): I will be going into complete silence from
here on out so finish me.

<p>
(GM to SEAN): I'm not trying to be difficult here, but forgive
me if I am skeptical about the ``complete silence'' part....
I also ***tried*** to follow your convoluted requests about
which press to publish and which press to delete.
If I got it wrong, I suggest in the future that you just save it
up on a floppy disk and then send what you want to have printed
to me at the end.
I'm pretty sure I've printed some press that you wanted deleted
and deleted some press that you wanted printed.

<p>
(SPAIN to I/G): Better come up with something fast.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR AT&#196;TURK PO-LLARD to THE WORLD): Notice our file photo
only recently taken.
Our newly acquired Armored Personnel Carriers and their crews
are receiving special instructions.
Soon they will be on the move...

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): <i>TAP</i> #208 with a deadline of 12 September
arrived on 22 September.
Some doofus put a Polish fleet in LAT instead of in LIT on the map.
<i>((That doofus would be me....))</i>
Better get on his case.
<i>((I went and stood on my briefcase, but it didn't help, perhaps
I need a full case.))</i>
Speaking of the map, shouldn't IRN (Iran) be considered a space with
split coasts as far as fleets go?
<i>((Yes, it definitely should!))</i>
You need to add (nc) and (sc) as appropriate.
Sorry, but Internet acecess at the local library is very limited
(MASSIVE budget cuts) and the school kids usually have them all
reserved until closing time.
<i>((You wouldn't live in Orange County, would you?
Never mind.... you're excused.))</i>
My 54th birthday was 4 October 1998.
Sputnik One was launched on my 13th birthday.
I remember that well.
Could write up the story if you think anybody in <i>TAP</i> might be 
interested in something that happened so long ago.
<i>((I thought the launching was closer to the day I was born, 
which was five days before your aforementioned 13th birthday....))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN to BOOB): No I am not like that when watching tv. I get like that 
when I'm reading a romance novel.

<p>
(TURKISH SCIENCE FICTION CLUB to MR. ANDRUSCHAK): We have not received your
last payment.
Please remit.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOOB 2): Ain't a boob part of a woman. Or are you trying to 
scare us by the boo?

<p>
(A TURKISH ZEALOT to AMBASSADOR SCHULTZ): Welcome to the scene of Armageddon!

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): I apologize for leaving the plan, but you could help 
wipe me out if I allowed you through there and so fourth.

<p>
(GERMANY to BRITAIN): Oh, dear.  We have to get a bloody build
somewhere, don't you know....  

<p>
(THE FOURTH REICH to BOARD): Here we are, timid as churchmice.
Who would have expected it (a surfeit of allies?) of us, the bellicose
ones who are so prone to ROARing....

<p>
(POLAND to FRANCE): A little close to the Italian borders, aren't you?

<p>
(BRITAIN to SPAIN): ``May God grant you always; a sunbeam to warm you,
a moonbeam to charm you, a sheltering angel so nothing can harm you.''

<p>
(BRITAIN to POLAND): Make room.
I'll be there soon enough.

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): I will not cease fire on all French even with your 
apologies I would have to keep to the declaration of war. All I want you 
to do for the cease fire is to move out of Bar and I'll battle for Por.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK - SEAN O'DONNELL): Some more friendly advice.
Please give serious consideration to joining the NYEED game.
I'll be glad to give you some strategy tips, starting with the
concept of ``tit-for-tat''. 
Trust me, I'm just trying to help.

<p>
(SPAIN to ALL OF TAP MEMBERS): If you wish to play me to my face then 
please be in Dayton Ohio November 7th Jamie's Rubicon games. Then you 
can say I saw I conquered or something to that effect.

<p>
(FRANCE-GM): I received letters from Germany on 9 September,
from Britain on 11 September, and from Poland on 18 September.
Nothing from Egypt/Italy/Russia/Turkey/Ukraine.
I think postal PBM is on its last legs, despite your cheerful,
upbeat outlook.

<p>
(SPAIN to THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION): Can you please get out of Spain? 
I made an alliance with James Bond he left MI6 he is now part of the 
Spanish High Command.
 
<p>
(PIRATE CAPTAIN ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): ``Never clean a porthole with a soft boiled
egg.''

<p>
(SPAIN <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): ``Non (ita me di ament) quicquam referre putavi,
utrumne os an culum olfacerem Andruschak.
Nilo mundius hoc, niloque immundior ille, verum etiam culus mundior et 
melior: nam sine dentibus est.''
Translation: God help me, I didn't think there was much in it;
whether I sniffed Andruschak's mouth or his rear end.
The former is no fresher, the latter is no fouller.
But come to think of it, his rear end is finer because at least
it has no teeth.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOOB): You Killed Kenny!

<p>
(POPE to SPAIN): ``There is an angel watching over you in good times, trouble,
or stress.
His wings are wrapped round about, whispering you are loved and blessed.''

<p>
(FALSE SPANISH DUDE to BOOB): You batard!

<p>
(CHARLES JONES <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> PACK OF IDIOTS): Let's see if I got this straight.
France supports a German army that isn't there, Poland cannot tell the 
difference between a fleet and an army, and Spain cannot fight his way
out of a paper bag.  I'm asking the GM to put me on the standby list for 
this game just so I can get a chance to show you beef jerkys how the game
is SUPPOSED to be played, even if the GM doesn't know where half the Polish
fleets really are.  
<i>((I resemble that remark!!))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): I am disengaging in all alliances I have 
including Jeff's. Past that they no longer exist if they existed in the 
beginning. I have no blood type. Red.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-DR. WEISS): A +

<p>
(BOOB to DR. WEISS): I think Harry has it right, can you exist without
a blood type??

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): What's up. Nice knowing yah! Unlike everyone else on 
the board. I don't believe the policy will change all that much with an 
anti-Spain so I'm no longer in Spain I'm in the White Star* on the coast 
of Tunisia. 

<p>
(FRANCE-BRITAIN): We need to re-negotiate the fee structure for the
use of the Channel Tunnel.
We should charge fees based on the number of people in the car
instead of the current flat fee per car.
This change should fix the problem of the Carpool Tunnel Syndrome.

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): I still say it might be in the south.

<p>
(PALACE OF VERSAILLES-GRECIAN EUNUCHS): So why blame Us for
the acts of the Turks?
The practice of castration is an ancient one, seen in almost 
every culture that ever existed.
(Including Classical Greece.)
<i>((I wonder if Henry Hyde has heard of it....))</i>
That would include most of the Biblical ones.
<i>((Can you say David and Bathsheba??
Sure you can.... I guess David avoided it so that the
genealogy in the New Testament could be followed.))</i>
This does NOT mean that We approve of what has been done to you.
Indeed no.
In fact, We intend to come to your rescue Real Soon Now.
<i>((Are you related to Mark Nelson??))</i>
(We have to eliminate the barbaric institution of the bullfight 
in Spain first.)
By the way, We hope the Turks didn't add insult to injury by circumcising 
you as well.
<i>((How would we know??))</i>
Bur rest assured that We will come to avenge you, and deal those 
dastardly Turks (and their rotten science fiction writers) a blow
they will never forget.
Now please look on the bright side of life.
Your castrations mean you have amuch lower chance of death
from prostate cancer.
Ask Dr. Weiss if you don't believe Us.
``If Life hands you lemons, make lemonade!''

<p>
(SPAIN to EGYPT): You have a choice to make and you will not like the 
choices.

<p>
(RICH GORENSON (sic) to SEAN O'DONNELL (sick)): Will you please stop
all those whines about Spain being the first country eliminated?
Russia is far more likely to be eliminated first.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): I'm going into Communication Silence I'll just wait to 
get blitzed it won't take that long to do so since after all I'll have 
only Tunis by the end of next year or less. Spain over and out.

<p>
1) Thanks to Andy York for jumping into the game very quickly and with some
gusto!!
I really appreciate it.
Could I have a phone number, Andy?
We are sorry to be saying goodbye to Jonas Johnson, who is resigning from
all of his Diplomacy games and the hobby.
I know I speak for everyone in wishing him all the best.

<p>
2) Still, with all of Andy's gusto, players were concerned that they
did not have enough time to get acquainted with Andy and bring him
into the game.
I tried to be sensitive to those feelings and have delayed the game.
Spring will not be due until the 24th.
Please realize that as you receive this, that is NOT far away!
You must begin negotiating now as I will not delay the game further.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MR. LOW HOF): I guess to you the players who have moral
fiber do what you tell them to, like that dork Austria, and anyone
else who lowers your HOF rating doesn't?

<p>
(FRA-GER): Let's see.
You're at 15, and need three more to win.
I've got five supply centers, so if we plan this correctly, you
can pick up three of them, win the game, and I still survive with
two.
Hey, sounds good to me!

<p>
(MIKE B to CHARLES J): Dave Burgess (Jim-Boob's brother) is real; I
played FTF boardgames with him several times when he was at
SUNY-Binghamton, and saw him for an afternoon at LabCon over July 4
weekend this summer.  But if I'm not real then my word is not sufficient
proof of Dave's existence.  While we're at it, how do you know that YOU
are real?  You might just be a temporary waveform in the dream of some
lifeform on a different plane of existence.  Or Jim-Boob's dark side may
have made you up as a release for crankiness when his bowels are backed
up.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): As I get into position I will support your fleet
in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean and Army in Marseilles.
I would hate to see the Turkish player improve his HOF rating any.
By the way if I was playing Austria in this game I'd either just
quit sending in moves, and let the other players eliminate me, or
vote against the draws just for spite.  I'm glad that you are having
fun now, and one way or another this game will end soon with the way
we are playing.

<p>
(FRA-GM): Poor old Weiss.
He is obviously a product of the limited educational system available
in California.
They spend so much time being politically correct, they forgot that it
was useful to gain knowledge so that they could live a decent life.
Still, people of limited intellect have a place in society as well.
The world needs ditchdiggers, too!

<p>
(MIKE B to RICHARD W): Now for you I have not even a farfetched
potential explanation.  The truth seems too outlandish.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): Why would any GM start ``The Abyssinian Prince''
with any issue except number 1?
If this is issue #209 why shouldn't there be 208 issues preceding it?
I have now decided that I don't believe in Mike B, anyone named Stafford,
and Richard Weiss.

<p>
(BOOB to GERMANY): Your loss.
Actually, there are MORE than 208 issues preceding it, but that's a story
too long and confused to bother to explain here. 
Suffice it to say that there are plenty of issues back there....

<p>
(FRA-TUR): Just think, if you had been the product of the normal
upbringing of two decent parents, you might have been able to realize
that walking away from this game with a three-way draw is preferable
to getting nothing but an outright German win.
All you would have needed to do was kill Austria.
But I guess you are just too ``simple'' to figure that out.

<p>
(MINUTES FROM THE HOF COMMITTEE): 

<p>
 Mike B: Can you believe how badly Richard screwed up in Columbus
Chill?

<p>
 Don S: No I can't!
He could have won the game but was his same butt hole self and is now
going to lose.

<p>
 Dan S: Why hasn't he killed the Austrian player yet and picked
up the one center and another extra build?
Isn't that the stupidest thing you've ever seen?

<p>
 Jim-Bob B: I just love to have him play in my ``The Abyssinian
Prince'' he's so funny to watch, and he always justifies the low HOF rating.

<p>
 Mike B: He is such a poor player we should just drop him from the
rating altogether.

<p>
 Don S: We will vote next meeting.
