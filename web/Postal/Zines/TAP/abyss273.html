<br /><br />Hi all, unfortunately I have to dedicate another issue to Paul and Sandy Kenny
as they have been going through a real tough time.  See the notes from Paul and
Sandy down at the end of the letters section.  
Their son did not make it through his surgery a few weeks ago.
Sandy and Paul did really well at keeping me up on what was happening, so I'll
report their notes in order below so you can see how it developed.
I'm praying for them and their family as they pick up their lives and move forward.

No kidding!  We have oodles of subszines in here, something from Rip Gooch,
Michael Lowrey, and Dave Partridge for sure and I might have something more
from Harold Reynolds too, I've forgotten just this instant.
Nah, I'm sure I have another one from him here too.
Good, the full complement.
Enjoy the meat between the white bread!!!
Oh yeah, there's also some kind of sub-sub-subszine hanging around in here somewhere,
what is that REALLY Richard Weiss????

I talked about deadline extensions, but was talked out of it.  I will try to 
keep deadlines on track as best I can.  I'm behind on a couple of important
things that will DEFINITELY be in next time.
With my delays and a bit of a pushback, this really doesn't slow the games down too much,
I hope, but more feedback would be fine.
For most of you, the main message is GET YOUR FALL ORDERS IN NOW!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 
<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

David Wang still has the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has one opening, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Find Steve Knight by issue 275 and win the fifty buck prize!!
come on, I KNOW Steve must be on the Internet somewhere
these days, so he should be able to be found relatively easily.
I'm surprised we're getting so little action on Steve, BUT
we have found Al Pearson!!!  See more below:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Subject: The Long Lost Al Pearson

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,
Of course this is the real Al Pearson, and I was in the Google search
list.  After changing jobs in the early 80's, I spent ten years working for a
university in Florida.  Then ten years working for Electronic Data Systems
living in North Carolina, Texas, Maryland and then back to North Carolina.  I
primarily ran projects where cameras took pictures of cars running red lights,
and our operation sent our citations to the owners.  I am now in Florida as a
Vice President of a computer software company which does law enforcement and
homeland security work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been out of the hobby since the early 80's as you know.  In
fact I just ran across your zine while checking on my own name is google (who
knows what may have been printed about me in the past ten years).  I am very
sorry to hear about Kathy Byrne.
I look forward to hearing from you in the future.

The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.
Check these out if you like:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

As we tried to get together last Fall's issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.
I've heard almost nothing on this lately, so it is getting close to going away,
but who knows, someone may get frisky.

If you want to subscribe in paper form at $3 per issue,

Michael,
Jim suggested me (in <i>TAP</i> 271) as a reference for your inquiry about 
United rules.  None of the rulesets from the postal leagues I played in 
are known to be online, but I saw this on slashdot.org today:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"MSWL is one of the most popular PBEM football (soccer for North 
Americans) game, which is itself a variation of a game of postal soccer 
invented by Alan Parr in England around 1970. In this game, each manager 
has to organise his team, manage fatigue, train his players and trade 
them. Olmec is a game engine written by Alla Sellers. It helps the 
commissioner (game master) to simulate the games and publish the 
results. Allan has decided to release the source code of Olmec under 
the GPL, so that everyone can enhance the program. The actual version of 
Olmec is written in Visual Basic and uses MS Access as a database. The 
author suggests Olmec could be rewritten in a multiplatform language, 
for example Java, using MySQL as the database. This task is made easy 
because of the rich documentation about the game engine (PDF format)."

<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno (Wed, 30 Jul 2003 20:53:51 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Things are definitely picking up for me musically.  On Tuesday July 29, 
three days after I attended a nine-hour blues festival, a co-worker 
offered free tickets to that very evening's Blues Traveler concert in 
Elmira, NY.  I snatched one up and got to hear a great concert for the 
cost of a few gallons of gasoline and a few quarters in a parking meter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Blues Traveler has been big for close to a decade, so most readers who 
would care are familiar with the band's music:  John Popper's 
high-energy harmonica and vocals over the 
lead-guitar / bass-guitar / keyboards / drums of a rock and groove band.  On 
several songs, the bassman swapped for an electric stand-up bass the 
size and cross-section of an acoustic bass viol, though much thinner.  A 
casual listener might say that all their original songs sound the same, 
even though they've been writing songs for so long.  I'll counter that 
by citing their performances on four diverse covers:  Charlie Daniels' 
"The Devil Went Down to Georgia" (not sure if this might have been 
written by Leon Russell or somebody); an early (like maybe Woodstock) 
Carlos Santana instrumental; the Violent Femmes' punk classic "Blister 
in the Sun"; and Bob Marley's reggae classic "No Woman No Cry".  None of 
these four tunes merely aped the famous versions, yet they didn't sound 
alike; they weren't merely mushed together into one constant style. 
Each was easy to dance to, in different ways.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I couldn't say the same for some of the band's own songs; some are in 
funky time signatures like a 2 plus 3 beat pattern, and some have time 
changes or pauses.  At times I failed my rhythm-check die-rolls.  But 
other times I seemed to have enough coherent bounce that, even though my 
co-worker and her friend refused to dance beyond head-bobbing, a teenage 
girl (under half my age) came over and danced with me a few times.  Each 
time she said "I'll be back" until her boyfriend (whom she flashed) got 
jealous over her dancing with me in a big ol' armswingin' Tennessee hop.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not a big Tuesday night crowd, maybe 1500-2000 people in a small hockey 
arena, the CoachUSA Center, not nearly full.  Around half the people 
were down on the floor, with the proportion increasing through the 
night, but not many were dancing.  Our radio-station-giveaway comp 
tickets were floor Standing Room (I insisted "Dancing Room") tickets. 
It was almost like a club atmosphere rather than a big venue.  Our view 
was good from the middle of the front half of the floor, I could have 
worked my way closer if I'd wanted, and I had fine sound balance except 
when I circled around the side in front of one bank of speakers.  The 
band played three hours without a break.  Somebody was usually soloing 
while Popper turned his back to the audience and enjoyed the bluesman's 
traditional muggles.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had heard Blues Traveler once previously, back in 1996 or '97.  I 
brought a couple of female coworkers to a small auditorium in Bozeman, 
Montana.  But the (seemingly gigawatt or terawatt) sound overwhelmed 
that small space.  It was hard on the girls' ears and they weren't 
walking around dancing in better-sounding parts of the auditorium, so 
they went outside.  This year in Elmira the sound turned out much better 
in the arena's bigger space.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I got there late enough to miss at least half of the opening band's set. 
It's just as well.  One guy didn't play anything, just did vocals and 
seemed to think that we had paid to watch him dance.  I came to the 
conclusion that the band would be improved by losing Hand-Jive Boy, but 
it turned out that it was the Ted Somebody Band and he was Ted.  He 
pushed their new CD rather aggressively, and made a point to say "If you 
didn't buy it here, I don't want to sign it here."  The cover tunes were 
lame and the originals were weaker, with half a verse worth of lyrics 
too many times.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh well.  The second band more than made up for the first.  Overall the 
night was an excellent time, everyone got home safely, and I'm glad I 
went.  You never know all of what the day holds when you get up each 
morning!

Hey, in these times of crisis and endless tribulations, "just fun" is 
special enough.  Since this fun was free-admission for me, which was 
just about exactly what I could afford, I got <b>excellent</b> value for the 
invested time and cost.  I forgot to mention that after a half-hour 
drive back home, I walked my dog more than a mile by Marslight.  I did 
the same thing the previous night, the 28th, when the Sun, Earth, and 
Mars were nearest straight in line.  We also walked the 17th-18th 
overnight, when Mars and the Moon were nearest in the sky.

If in summers you go to four-week deadlines, will you also make them 
combined seasons?  Honestly, in the Internet Age, eight weeks between 
moves is too long.  In four weeks, most postal-only players will be able 
to take care of negotiating and ordering without running up their phone 
bills.  On the other hand, switching back and forth between separated 
and combined seasons might confuse some players each year.

QUICK RECAP:  The first-ever public examination of voting machine 
software, obtained when Diebold left it in the open on an obscure but 
public web site, revealed stunning flaws. "Our analysis shows that this 
voting system is far below even the most minimal security standards 
applicable in other contexts." - Researchers from Johns Hopkins and 
Rice Universities, (already tagged as the "Hopkins Heroes") in paper 
just released: "Analysis of an Electronic Voting System" 
http://avirubin.com/vote.pdf . Remote access has been left unprotected, 
encryption keys made available to hackers, you can vote more than once. 
There's more: http://www.blackboxvoting.org/access-diebold.htm - You 
can overwrite votes. The system is vulnerable to both inside and outside 
attacks. Intruders can change audit logs. You can assign passwords to 
all your friends. (A list of links to news articles from last week is

Film review:
Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A gorgeous film, shot in Hunan in kaarst country. directed by the author 
of the original book (for once a faithful adaption of a book!), it is a 
semi-autobiographical tale of two Chinese city boys sent to the countryside 
of China in 1970 to be re-educated by the peasants. One is the son of a 
`reactionary' dentist whose crime was to have once filled a cavity in 
Chiang Kai Chek's teeth.
Soon their village is visited by the aged tailor from a neighbouring 
village, and his beautiful daughter, the little seamstress. Both boys fall 
in love with her, and discover another boy sen to be re-educated has a 
cache of `forbidden' foreign literature. To woo the seamstress, they take 
turns to read to her from Balzac, Hugo, Tolstoy...
But what will this sudden education mean to her?
The film was not filmed in the village that the author was actually sent 
to, for reasons that become apparent later in the film.
A joint French-Chinese production, I am surprised the Chinese allowed it to 
be made, though it is less political than a human story of love.
visually gorgeous, the film was only lowered in my estimation by the 
peasants all being too rosy cheeked, and clean. Only the miller and the 
aged chief really looked like peasants,rather than middle-class actors in a 
rural setting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />Nowhere in Africa.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winner of the Oscar for best foreign film, this German feature tells the 
story of a Jewish man, Walter, who migrates to Kenya and manages to 
persuade the local Jewish community to sponsor his wife and child out of 
Germany to him in 1938. But once in Africa, they may be safe, but are they 
happy? The wife, Jettl,  has great difficulty adapting to being the 
housewife of a farm overseer: in charge of black labourers, but outranked 
by the British farm owner, who has little sympathy for the refugees. Can 
she adapt from being a privileged socialite to the new isolated, hash 
African environment? Her husband gave up a job as a lawyer to get out of 
Germany, and her culture shock is fueled by her resentment of their lowered 
status. The young daughter, Regina, slowly grows up, adapting to the German 
Jewish, British and African languages and cultures she's immersed in. Then 
war breaks out an the family is interned... the men to a camp, the women to 
a hotel in Nairobi where lobster features daily on the menu (the hotel 
refuses to lower its standards, even if requisitioned as a POW 
camp).  Jettl sees a way to obtain her family's release... but at what 
cost? Then once the war is over, and Walter is offered a job as a judge in 
Frankfurt, which of the family want to return to the Germany that forced 
them out? But can they stay in a British African colony?
An exotic setting for a Jewish refugee story. sympathetic to the plight of 
the Jews and Africans. The only downside was the sex scenes which seemed 
out of place. Regina removing her blouse to climb trees was also an 
unnecessary scene, included for the director's masturbatory fantasies I 
felt. But otherwise a pleasant way to spend 2.5 hours in the dark.

Jim-Bob,
Ah, we're finally to the point where we can start thinking about 
baseball.  Now that the free agents are finally landing with the rich 
teams, we can finally figure out who will make the post-season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Question 1:  will the NL Central winner this year have 85 wins? 
<i>((Absolutely!))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`Question 2:  will the AL Central winner this year have 80 wins?
<i>((Doubly absolutely, and perhaps the new "your" White Sox
will be there, though I'm desperately rooting for Tony Pena
and his Royals and against Carl Everett and what has become
his White Sox.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What should have been the biggest story of the baseball year:  the 
made-for-TV-we-gotta-make-someone-watch-this All-Star game that no one 
wants to play in, becomes something that actually counts in the 
standings.  The dumbest idea since interleague play.  But it all gets 
overshadowed a few days earlier, when Randall Simon proves he will swing 
at anything, even an 8-foot-tall sausage costume.  It was only fitting 
that he did it while wearing the Pirates' mustard-colored throwback 
uniform.  In retrospect, I guess it was inevitable.
<i>((I absolutely agree about both, but the All Star thing wasn't really
a fiasco and it became an entertaining game, for whatever reason.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Question 3:  Do you still believe that the Red Sox can win the pennant?  
<i>((Absopositivelutely!!!  Go Sox!  That means PASSING the Yankees.))</i>
How about for last year?
<i>((Sigh, I was on the record as saying they would take the Wild Card
and was wrong, but this year's team is just SO much better.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On another strange topic, let's rewind to something we discussed 4 years 
ago:  state quarters.  Does anyone save these anymore?  Since the "Old 
Man of the Mountain" fell down, is the New Hampshire quarter worth more 
or less?  Check with Partridge on this.
<i>((I will.... but the space-time continuum definitely had earthquakes
running through it when the Old Man came down.
I can't tell you how many strange things I saw..... you wouldn't believe me.
Perhaps THAT was what was holding the Red Sox back, go Sox!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The new job in Chicago is pretty good.  The only difficulty is the fact 
that we haven't yet sold the house in Toledo.  I've racked up 3 times 
the miles on my car in the last 2 months than in the previous unemployed 
8 months just driving back and forth.  Anyone need a very nice house on

You may have (accidentally, in all likelyhood) stumbled across something
here Jim-Bob.  Consider:  every team in MLB plays 6 or 7 games a week.  Even
the worst (ok, maybe not the Tigers, but everyone else) team in baseball
wins 2 games a week.  Think about that:  at least 2 days every week fans
feel good about their team.  You can't say that about any other sport.  So
the regular season does matter a lot more in MLB than elsewhere, at least to
the fans.  So Red Sox fans get more highs per year than, say, Patriots fans
(heck, probably more than Patriots, Celtics &amp; Bruins fans put together).
Something to think about.

Jim,
MUSIC
Might as well put in a couple of paragraphs here about what I am buying 
these days which, as ever, is an odd assortment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the wife I bought Melanie C's most recent album,""Reason".  Your 
readers might know her better as "Sporty Spice".  My wife likes female 
singers and this usually means she ends up buying dreadful slushy Diana 
Ross "I'm Still Waiting" tosh so any opportunity to sneak in something with 
a bit of punch is not to be missed.  Mel C. is, of course, massively 
unfashionable, but she has a strong voice and her songs - whilst not as 
annoyingly infectious as Avril Lavigne's - are of a decent standard.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other album I bought for Lin was "Up" by Right Said Fred, to replace 
the cassette version that went missing about 7 years ago.  This purchase 
was mostly for sentimental reasons as when we first started going out Lin 
only owned about 4 albums that weren't vinyl and this was one of them (the 
others were "Best of the Bangles", Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes and some 
dreadful compilation of American AOR) but, as the name of the album 
suggests, it is a tremendously upbeat pop album - and yes, it does have 
"I'm Too Sexy" on it.
<i>((I don't think I ever knew that Right Said Fred ever did anything
but a dance single, and you really could do worse than the Supremes and
the Bangles.
Really, you could.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For number one son (aged 13) I have been buying the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
and Linkin Park whilst refusing to buy him Metallica.  The Chili Peppers 
may well be the top band in the world right now though doubtless someone 
will crawl out of the woodwork to say they were much better 10 years ago.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For my own collection I have been belatedly filling in some gaps in my 
BritPop collection with albums by Feeder (Polythene) and Dodgy (Homegrown). 
I have no idea whether either of these bands means a thing in the USA - 
the latter have long since disbanded and were in any case overshadowed by 
Oasis and Blur, but if Oasis are the Beatles, Blur are Small Faces/Kinks 
then Dodgy are The Who.  Their album "Three Peace Sweet" is the best Who 
album since Quadrophenia and features a thinly disguised song about Keith 
Moon.  "Homegrown" has yet to make the same impact on me but I have only 
listed to it 4 times.  It's bouncy, melodic and rocky but if anything is 
too accessible and undemanding.
<i>((As should be well known, I am a HUGE, HUGE Blur fan and really 
can't stand even one chord of Oasis.
And I do recognize that this is entirely emotional and devoid of reason.
It isn't a surprise that I actually also generally don't care for the Beatles
and love the Small Faces.
The Kinks, well, maybe, depends on my mood.
But I've never heard of Dodgy or Feeder!
And I've been in a "Tommy" orgy of late since my wife is going to be designing
a production of it next spring, so this has all the more appeal.
I'll have to look this up.
If this connects at all, my favorite "Brit Pop" type group that almost 
no one knows in the US is the Close Lobsters.
Can we now have the obligatory comment from our Close Lobsters expert??
You know who you are....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Feeder album is also taking a time to grown on me.  I own one of their 
other albums (Echo Park) and this is warmly recommended to anyone who likes 
bright, energetic pop-rock with big choruses, but "Polythene" (which I 
think is their first album) starts off great and then tails off towards the 
end.  This is somewhat surprising to me as normally bands have a stock of 
tried and tested songs for the first album and it is the third album (or 
more likely the second album these days, since CDs require a larger number 
of tracks on them than vinly LPs) which normally reveals whether the 
songwriters can write on demand.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just over a week ago I went to see a band called the Cosmic Rough Riders.  I 
am pretty sure hardly anyone has heard of them in the UK, never mind the 
US, but they are a real oddity - a modern-day folk-rock band in the Byrds 
mould (for younger readers the Byrds were like REM but with better songs &amp; 
singers...!).  The strangeness is accentuated by the fact that they come 
from Glasgow, a major Scottish city famed for its rough inner-city 
districts, and yet they sing songs about harvesting the land, peace and 
love, dolphins and the countryside.  Thanks to the glorious three-part 
harmonies, the jingly-jangly guitars and the Indian-style percussion they 
manage to pull it off, but I am still not sure if they are sending 
themselves up.  Their first album is called "Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine", 
which neatly sums up what they are about and if anyone is intrigued I will 
happily buy a copy on their behalf (via the ISE) and ship it to the States. 
More info on the band is available on www.cosmicroughriders.com

We recently upgraded to Cable Digital and so have something called the 
Hallmark channel which as well as showing re-runs of the peerless 
Homicide: Life On The Streets, also shows episodes of Providence, a

haven't actually seen any of the episodes but I have seen the trailers

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Tim Miller (Sun, 20 Jul 2003 06:46:49 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Terminator 3 (warning, contains spoilers)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Summary: Turn off your brain and have a lot of fun...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Terminator 3 is a movie that knows when to take itself seriously and 
when not to. The opening is downright comedic, and the end similarly 
chilling. Of course, like its predecessors, T3 features an eeevil 
terminator sent back to kill John Connor (the man who will rally 
humanity to defeat the machines) and the good terminator (played as 
always by the ever-reliable Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent to protect him. 
The chase scene between the two of them, the evil terminator driving a 
construction crane and Ah-nold taking the wheel of a fire engine fire 
engine presents us with cartoon violence of the highest order.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The middle of the film dragged a bit, though. It's more or less 
by-the-numbers terminator vs. terminator action combined with the John 
Connor and Sarah Brewster fall in love subplot. This is well hashed 
genre material, to an extent, and it's executed reasonably well, but 
nothing spectacular.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The end, however, struck me as absolutely chilling. <i>((ENDING
DISGUISED - BUT WARNING, MORE SPOILERS TO COME))</i> 
were genuinely compelling. One scene depicted a 
run-down North Dakota barn in the foreground, and in the background 
dozens of ICBMs being launched from their silos. The combination of the 
idyllic pastoral image with the knowledge of the raw destructive power 
these weapons carried seemed very effective. The final scene showed just 
enough balance between terror and optimism.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In summary:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Good - Ah-nold turns in a fine performance. The opening and closing 
of the movie was quite effective.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Bad  - Weak in the middle. Laughably ludicrous computer science in 
describing how SkyNet works/is able to turn eeevil and take over the 
military.
<i>((Yeah, it felt like the writers were stuck in the 1980's))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nitpicker patrol part 1/2 - Why is it that two bums off the street are 
allowed to enter a top-secret military base just because they're 
travelling with the daughter of the commanding general?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nitpicker patrol part 2/2 - Sarah Brewster's dad tells them the access 
codes to the facility that supposedly holds the mainframes that control 
Skynet. We learn later that Mainframes do not control Skynet. You'd 
think the general in charge of the project would know how Skynet works 
- either that or he somehow knew the Terminator's plan in advance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<i>((Ohmigod, don't tell me you didn't get what Sarah's father was doing!
He gave them the codes and sent them there on a "wild goose chase"
on purpose so they would be in a crash shelter and survive the
nuclear war.  The lie was to get them to go.
Did I misread you, or did you misread what was going on?  That
wasn't a nitpick, that was a key "neat plot device" of the movie.
Did you note that the Dad was on the list for the Terminator to kill?
That was the reason he was on the list.  They WANTED him to
be "let loose" so why would they want to kill Dad?  Anyone would
have let them loose, but only Dad would have saved Sarah and John.
PS You're right on about that other nitpick.  I worried about that too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I did sort of figure something like that out after awhile (I figured the 
general knew the world was doomed, so he sent John and Sarah off to 
where they would be safe), but the exposition in the movie was a bit 
confusing about it. I mislabeled an exposition problem (I thought it 
was) as a nitpick. And why didn't he just tell them "Look, there's no 
stopping it, but you guys had been go hide at this secret facility, 
here's the access code..." I think that would've worked and been a bit 
more obvious about what was going on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((But this way the AUDIENCE thought that perhaps the whole
world would be saved, until the end.
But that's screenwriting, it also make sense for real too.  The father
didn't think his daughter would give up trying to save the "whole world"
so easily.  Better to make them desperate to get there because
they did think they could stop it.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Tim Miller (Sun, 20 Jul 2003 22:19:36 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hrm ... I suppose so, but it still left me a bit puzzled as to what the 
real motives were. OK I'll partially withdraw that particular criticism. 
But one more that I missed:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why didn't Skynet, with its military control, shoot down the Cessna? 
Maybe it didn't see it as a threat, but given that the eeevil terminator 
had more or less taken control of Skynet by interfacing with it, you 
would think she would've told it "kill these people".

Look, I'm not saying it was great, only that I liked that particular plot device the
best that bothered you so much at the start.
Let's lead off Steve Langley's thoughts with his thoughts about the same movie.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I came away with a "Been there, done that" feeling.  There was possibly the
most destructive car chase ever filmed, but the destruction was gratuitous.
The bad terminator was driving this huge crane vehicle in pursuit of John
Conner.  For reasons inexplicable to me she swung the crane out to the side and
started dragging it through parked cars and small buildings.  Of course it gave
the good terminator something to grab onto in his own pursuit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The bad terminator was a woman this time.  That is to say, designed to pass
as a woman.  Like I said, been there, done that, who cares?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Arnold was looking very good for a man his age.  Still, he was looking very
good for a man his age, and he is really past walking naked into a biker bar. 
The love handles are a design flaw?  I don't know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The two central humans were actually the best part of the show.  John Conner
(Nick Stahl) came across as a tough and resilient kid who was really feeling
put upon by a universe that refused to stay saved.  He'd stopped judgment day
when he was 14, it wasn't fair that it was coming again.  Kate Brewster (Claire
Danes) was excellent as the future Mrs. Conner, who thought she was being
kidnapped by him and his terminator, and never gave up trying to outwit and
outfight her captors.  Once she came to believe the impossible and decided to go
along with them, she was still pretty convincing.  John Conner may have been the
leader of humanity after judgment day, but it was clear from this film that
Kate Brewster was the power behind the man.

"Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Have you  noticed that there are a whole lot of movies with ":" in the
title.  It has to do with money of course. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, let me start by saying that I don't usually go see comedies.  There
was something about the trailers for "Legally Blonde 2" that drew me in, and
despite not being a big Reese Witherspoon fan I loved the movie.  So, when the
chance to see a sequel came along, I had to give it a try.  Could she pull off
the incredibly intelligent brainless blonde character again?  Could she take on
the real world with a totally blonde attitude, and make it work?  I don't
really accept the premise, but I was laughing a lot.  I wasn't alone in that. 
Really funny movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One thing that I did come away with.  America is currently getting the
haircut it deserves.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Sinbad:  Legend of the Seven Seas" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is not your Arabian Nights "Sinbad".  "Sinbad" (Brad Pitt voice) is a
pirate and good at it.  His attempt to steal a magical book from his boyhood
friend "Prince Proteus" (Joseph Fiennes voice) is interrupted by the minions
of "Eris, Goddess of Discord" (Michelle Pfeiffer voice).  The book is a source
of protection and peace which annoys Eris.  She wants to remove the book from
mortal control so she can have more fun tormenting.  Proteus wants to take
the book to his home, at the heart of the twelve kingdoms, to perpetuate peace
for his people.  Sinbad wants to sell the book to the highest bidder.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Later, Eris manages to steal the book and frame Sinbad for the job.  The
pirate is about to lose his head over it when Proteus steps forward (they were
childhood friends) and offers himself in Sinbad's place.  The council gives
Sinbad a time limit to return with the book, or Proteus dies.  Sinbad's immediate
thought is to sail to Fiji and retire, but Proteus' fiancee, "Marina"
(Catherine Zeta-Jones voice) stows away on his ship to make sure he returns
with the book.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A cartoon with a real plot, what is the world coming to?  Not only plot, but
some good dialogue, character development, everything a good story requires.
Add in some amazing animation and you have a good movie.  This is supposedly a
children's film, but I think there were more adult themes than not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((It's scary when ALL the best plotted films these days are children's films.
I think it's pretty much true.
There must have been a memo.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My favorite part of the film was Eris.  The computer graphics merged with
classical animation was amazing throughout, but between Michelle Pfeiffer's
interpretation, and the Goddess swirling in and out of her purple fog to
alternately seduce and threaten, Eris was a total delight.  We really need a
sequel just to give her more scope.

"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In 1998 Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill proposed a comic book idea for a short
series to America's Best Comics, one of the smaller independents.  The idea
was set in England and Europe at the turn of the previous century.  It was to
gather together some of the Victorian fictional characters and make a sort of 
Justice League out of them.  There were six issues.  The first couple gathered the
group together.  "Miss Wilhemina Murray" was the focal point.  She came from
the Bram Stoker novel, "Dracula".  With the help of "Captain Nemo" she first
collected a reluctant drug ridden "Alan Quartermain", and then swung by
Paris to meet with "Auguste Dupin" to capture "Mr. Edward Hyde" who was adding
to the legend of "Rue Morgue".  From there, back to England and a boarding
school for wayward young ladies to collect "The Invisible Man" who was passing
himself off as the Holy Spirit while having his way with the girls.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not a truly stellar crew.  Still, England was in peril.  The mysterious
criminal known as "The Doctor" was planning to take over the
world from his secret
hideout in Soho.  Since Marvel Comics owns the rights to "Fu Manchu",
America's Best took a risk of being sued depicting "The Doctor"
as closely as they did.  
Luckily Marvel was already having internal legal problems and probably
didn't want to confuse those issues.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie, by the same name, "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" took
the premise and some parts of the plot, and spun a whole new story.  A better
story from my point of view.  They also tossed in some new characters.  I don't
see why "Dorian Grey" was left out of the comic book version.  He seems such
a natural addition.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As ever, anymore, incredible computer effects.  "The Invisible Man" smears a
white cream over his face to give him features while interacting with the
others.  Occasionally there would be an over the shoulder shot, showing the mask
from the inside.  Very effective.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Because Sean Connery plays "Alan Quartermain" he was the leader of the film
version, while "Mina" was relegated to follower.  She picked up a few more
vampire powers in the film, with none of the weaknesses.  That is, she walked in
daylight, and seemed to have a reflection.  But she was all vampire when it
came to dealing with the bad guys.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I did think the `Nautilus' moving through the canals of Venice was a bit over
the top.  Hard to believe the canals are deep enough for a ship that size.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course, I liked it!

"Bad Boys II === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No colon in the title.  I guess they didn't get the memo.  I really liked 
"Bad Boys".  I thought it was fresh and funny.  "Bad Boys II" was pretty much
the same story but it was lots longer.  At least it seemed lots longer. 
This time the ongoing Martin Lawrence whining about Will Smith was no longer as
fresh and not nearly as funny, but there was a whole lot of it.  Just to be
fair, there were some funny parts, and there was lots of action.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The funniest line in the movie was delivered by one of the bit characters. 
"You two look like you are about to do something stupid.  I'm in!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There were some holes in the story that really needed to be plugged.  The Bad
Boys work for Miami Dade Vice which has not been able to put a certain bad
guy away because he apparently has a line into the department.  When you set up
the premise it is customary to follow-up on the story line. I guess it got
left on the cutting room floor.

All that being said, I was introduced to a new technical term for this type
of film.  "Cheesy Pirate Movie".  I can see that. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is an Action/Comedy that is longer on the comic than the action.  Not
that the action was missing.  Far from.  Some pretty fun stunts, some
swashbuckling sword fights, lots of flying through the air with aid of slashed lines,
but still, lots funnier than not.

"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was a little let down by the movie.  Lara Croft is a super hero.  She came
across that way in the first TR movie, but in the second she was more a female
Indiana Jones than she was a super hero.  Part of it was the stunts.  Instead
of the impressive physical stunting in the first movie this was more
technology stunting.  Well, except for the incredible pole vault from a roof top to a
helicopter.  Now that was impressive.  But flipping a jet ski, jumping a motor
cycle, sky diving, these are not up there with the bungee ballet.  While I'm
ranting, what was with that motor cycle jump?  Stunts should have some reason
behind them.  What was the story purpose in hauling a motor cycle to the top of
the great wall and then jumping it to a road below?  None that I could see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story was good enough.  Lara Croft and the Box of Pandora.  They had to
rewrite the Pandora myth a bit to make it fit the movie, but then, Lara said
that the myth everyone knew was the Sunday School version.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Angelina Jolie is still the only choice for the role.  She still makes me
want to believe in super heroes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots of action. some very good computer effects, pretty much what you would
expect.  The box itself wasn't much.  But then, it was supposed to be an old
box.  What should I have expected?

"Johnny English" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rowan Atkinson is truly a comedic genius.  I have known this for some time and
am still amazed by him. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"English" is a top secret agent ... in his dreams.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In his waking life he manages, through sheer incompetence, to wipe out the
entire set of British Secret Agents.  That leaves his boss, the man called
"Pegasus" with only one recourse.  "English" is put on the job. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With his trusty aide "Bough" (pronounced Boff) he manages to incompetently
uncover a plot to steal the British Empire.  Of course, no one believes him.
The villain is even mildly amused.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Malkovich has a lot of fun as `Pascal Sauvage' the French villain. 
Matalie Imbruglia is beautiful as `Lorna Campbell' the `Bond Girl' character.  She
is an Interpol Secret Agent who ends up working with `English'. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Very funny movie.

"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the third "Spy Kids" and the fantasy continues.  The story is as
always a fantasy for children, where the good guys win and make friends with the
bad guys.  That is the underlying theme that makes the Spy Kids work, the idea
of making friends with your enemies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In this episode, Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has left the OSS to become a
private eye.  But when he learns that his sister has gone on a mission and failed
to return, he rejoins OSS and goes in to rescue her.  Goes in means literally
going into a video game controlled by the Toymaker (Sly Stallone, who was
great in all his split personality roles).  This is a 3D movie.  Parts of it at
least.  The real world is normal film, but when Juni goes into the game, he does
so by putting on his VR glasses, and the audience follows suit. The 3-D
effects are all computer generated with human actors inserted.  Very effective
technique.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Carmen is prisoner on the fourth level.  Juni has to beat each level to get
to her.  There is a time limit, and he has limited lives.  Not only that, but
there is a gang of Beta Testers who are afraid that he might beat them to the
prize.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fun story, great effects, what's not to like?

"Bend It Like Beckham" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can not explain why I wanted to see this movie.  Normally a movie about 
sports of any sort repels me.  But when I saw the trailer I knew I had to see the 
film.  I'm so happy I give in to such impulses.  "Bend it Like Beckham" is 
this year's "My Big Fat Greek Wedding".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have culture gap, generation gap, and gender confusion, all wrapped up in 
some complex relationships that focus on a wedding and football.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`Jesminder Bhamra' (Parminder K. Nagra) is a better soccer player than any of 
the young men she plays with in the park.  Her mother would be horrified by 
the idea that her daughter would be alone with so many young men, so Jes 
doesn't tell her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`Juliette Paxton' (Keira Knightley) wants to be a professional soccer player. 
Her mother is sure that young men are not interested in girls with muscles.  
`Jules' father is happy with the idea that his daughter would rather play 
soccer than hang out with boys.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jules sees Jes play in the park.  Jules is on a girl's team, and she knows 
that with Jes on the team they would be unbeatable.  She's right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Between the two families, Jes's sister's wedding, soccer, an almost love 
story, this turns out to be a funny, feel good movie.

This has been the best "story" movie that I've seen this entire year thus far.
I think I saw it in March or something and like Wedding it is still hanging 
around, with expanding word of mouth.
You know this movie must be seen to be enjoyed....
speaking of the real Beckham for a minute, he truly is a breed apart as an
international superstar of stupendous proportions who is slowly migrating into
American consciousness.
Of course he plays a game (soccer) that we aren't supposed to care about.
And he's a genuinely "regular" guy.
That's OK, you know.))</i>

I do not know how else to report this.  Sean's surgery did not succeed.  He 
passed away during surgery at around 5:30 pm on Thursday July 17th at St.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note Eric Brosius' new E-Mail address in the standard hidden format.
You just take that " of " out and replace it with the at sign.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(NEW ENGLAND-EUROPEAN POWERS):  Thanks to everyone who wrote.  I'm going to
try to get my bearings as I enter this game, so I'm going to repeat the
orders of my predecessor this season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB VENTURES A GUESS): Looks to me like SOME steps are about to happen pretty soon.
Maybe not, but there might be some changes in the fall.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE BARNO):  At 2 AM on 17 July 2003, I have clear skies and a great 
view of Mars right beside the moon.  Perfect for walking the dog a mile 
and seeing nobody else.  Almost all lights are off so I can see the 
planet and moon more clearly than most people do.  Nobody on Mars nor 
even on the moon can force Bruce to cut me out of the draw.  The only 
way the rest of you players can do it is by throwing the win to him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
But you never know, given how extreme the yuppiedom part of the game
has gone.

(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "When we say we've had enough, we know
we really want more."  From "Hate Is the New Love", from <i>Ooooh!!!</i>.
Although, given some of what is below, I should have quoted from
<i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A CONVERSATION [KIRK AND SPOCK]):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock: Captain, Lt. Uhura just received an ultimatum from the 
Romulans demanding our unconditional surrender.
I understand that the Bajorans, Cardassians, and Klingons are
also considering recognizing Romulan "leadership".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk: What a bunch of pussies!
Have Uhura send this message on an open uncoded com pick to the 
Romulans, NUTS!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock: NUTS! Captain?
Not exactly original!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk: Would you prefer "they can have my Federation when 
they can pry my Enterprise from my cold dead fingers!"?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock: I get your drift, Captain, but we can't win unless we
can realign the universe against Romulus.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk: Mr. Spock, the Klingons don't take prisoners!
The last time you were captured by the Romulans they locked you 
up in a small room with Mr. Chekov and induced Pon Farr.
Mr. Chekov hasn't been able to wipe the smile off his face since!
Do you want to be a Romulan prisoner, Mr. Spock???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock: I'll have Lt. Uhura send the message to the Romulans.
NUTS!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY-SPAIN): Take that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to WORLD): I just had an odd thought.
I've been doing Star Trek press longer than the original series.
Life is good!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ANDRUSCHAK-JEFF): I would like to point out that we didn't have any wars at 
this kind of scale when Clinton was President. Clinton unlike Bush found 
better ways to send the United States into a (lack of a better word) up 
roar. I think that Clinton was the best President that the United States 
could have ever had.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EVIL COMMANDER WORF-CAPTAIN KIRK): Since 7 of 9 would not cooperate, I've been 
forced to use psychological torture. I've been forced to have 7 of 9 wear 
bikini's and skimpy dresses and skirts. I then had her wear a very skin 
tight uniform. No, Kirk in case you're wondering this is even tighter on her 
than those that you had her wearing.

(SPOCK AND KIRK II):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock: Captain, the Klingons are claiming they have 7 of 9 but they're putting her
on trial per Klingon tradition and their prisoner scan does not have a traditional 
Borg signature.
I'm guessing that 7 escaped.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk: Then where is she?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock: The more intriguing question is, can she help us???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EVIL COMMANDER WORF-CAPTAIN KIRK: I have a propaganda victory. I even have 
the willingness of 7 of 9 to stay with me and together we'll rule over the 
Federation. She did make one request that you (Kirk) become her 
unconditional slave, which includes but limited to. shaving her legs and if 
all else fails kissing her (       .)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY-EGYPT): Get your nephew back under control.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF-SEAN): I may be proud of you, but what did you do wrong?
