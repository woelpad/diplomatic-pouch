Not much of a health update this time.  I'm nearing the end of the treatment line,
so I'm really, really looking forward to that. 
I'm trying not to complain, but treatment side effects continue to be pretty annoying,
most recently much more fatigue.
But I think I must be counted as
one of the incredibly fortunate that just this chemotherapy seems to have knocked 
this out. The oncologist was sure I would need surgery when we started, but now?
Nothing to do surgery on.  Wishing all the rest of you who are struggling with 
health issues similar good news!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Doug may or may not be winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.
My intent right now is to do that.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to do that, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
If you looked before, I was having some problems with updating, but I've corrected
them, so you should be able to see everything there.  The address is still:
/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the new list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I'm going to switch to sending the link
in the announcements, we'll see if that helps.

<i>((If anyone from <b>TAP</b> or <b>ES</b> has ideas 
for more things to talk about here let me know.
I do have five or six ideas lined up here already that I just have to write.
Up soon is the local Maine Bluegrass festival coming up again this next weekend, but that will 
be NEXT issue.  It is supposed to be raining, and we'll see how much time I spend there slogging around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, what I will talk about is my continuing fascination with Jonathan Richman.  If you're reading this
in the <b>Eternal Sunshine</b> subszine location, you can see more from me in Doug's letters section.
Jonathan tours a lot, but presently seems to be taking a break after a recent swing through the US 
West.  He is coming to Pittsburgh next on November 4th, which kind of a long break for him.  He last
was in Providence a couple of years ago, and I've seen him many, many times over the years.
He tours with his drummer Tommy Larkins and they basically just do cool stuff.  While I love sailing down
New England roads with "Roadrunner" blasting from the car stereo, that really isn't him any longer.
In the last two decades or so, every time I've seen him it is more like a conversation than a concert,
he really is feeling and interacting with the audience, and it sometimes feels like he's writing new
songs as he plays.  He doesn't play some idea of "greatest hits", though with Jonathan who knows 
what those might be (perhaps the songs he happens to sing in the movie "Something About Mary"???).
I recently saw an interview where he actually says this, that he actually is making up songs as he
goes, finding a riff and then talking/singing over it.
Most of his songs sound like they were composed that way, actually.
Jonathan also is a big proponent of the new shift back into vinyl.
He has a few new records, all on vinyl.
This is great, since I still have about 2000 vinyl recordings and I've also started playing them again,
starting with my old Genesis albums.
My grand-niece, Willow, also is at the forefront of this trend, and I've given her a few things and 
when she visited our house, she was the one who got me to drag out the old Genesis records.  I also
have five or six old Jonathan Richman or Modern Lovers records on vinyl.
If you were going to think about where Jonathan Richman would play in Pittsburgh, you of course would
guess it would be at the Andy Warhol museum, right?  Of course.  
Since you all know that Jonathan is supposed to have often hung out with the Warhol crowd and slept on
his couch.
So anyway, I was hoping in this piece to tell you where to go see Jonathan some time soon, but I think
the Pittsburgh show already is nearly sold out, as it will be "an event".  But go get some vinyl
as I am about to do of some of his most recent records.
It's actually pretty hard to find them, as I've just been searching, so we'll see, I'll report
back later.  
If anyone goes to the Pittsburgh show, I'd be REALLY interested in a report!))</i>

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.

I really would like to figure out "what else to do in the szine", want to volunteer for the regular Dip game,
the Breaking Away game, or propose something else?</b>
