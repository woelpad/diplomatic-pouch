<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wait, what was that on the front of the szine, I'm SOOOO confused.  But no one else has my style and typeface, so you probably figured it out, this is whatever the real thing is.
This is a quickie catchup issue.  For my own personal sanity and sense of szineness, I must 
keep doing this, so I will, nope no folding, I'm a masochist.
But SOOO much has gone on in my life since we were last together.  
Both my wife and I had some semi-serious health problems, mine are resolved
(I think I already told you all that mine was a severe pinched nerve in my
neck that left me in constant pain for about two months, looking back, I do
not know how I managed to keep functioning!!!), 
hers are making progress toward being resolved and we have fingers crossed.
I had another summer at the camp in Maine which makes it so difficult to keep
this going as well.  
I'm teaching more at school and that seems to eat up time.
But hey, since I was last with you I also had that great wonderful fiasco in Bangor
Maine and I've been playing Dip all over the place, and <i>Diplomacy World</i>
finally feels back on track, so I hardly feel like I've not been around.
The <i>DW</i> section is down below and you all can go read there what I wrote about
Bangor.  
For the "new" NA DipCon at Tempest earlier this month, I proposed a whole host of
DipCon amendments, which I heard people "liked" but since I was in Maine, none
of them passed.
Does Boob ever get any respect?  Nah.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also got some energy to get this thing back going again by reading some
of the old postal szines that Doug Kent has been posting on the web.  Among
other things, you can see some of the original <i>Boob Reports</i> that started
this monstrosity, because remember that <i>The Boob Report</i> was a 
<i>North Sealth, West George</i> subszine and the &#214;rigin of Jim-Bob":
http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/oldzines/nswg6.pdf
Take off the last part down to the <i>DW</i>, Doug's home page, to see the main menu.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is back in stasis, but all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back at least sometimes he is producing this new fannish thing
called <i>Virtual Tucker Hotel</i> that you can find at
http://efanzines.com/VTH/.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing as a subszine, but he has 
a cool facebook page and you can keep track of him there.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games
and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York and Doug Kent have been my most frequent subszine guests lately!!!
Andy has been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And Doug Kent has been coming out faster than <i>TAP</i> lately, so
many issues have been having multiple <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s. 
I haven't heard from Michael Lowrey lately but he gets his in every few issues too!
So, we have a full set of subszines at the moment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MICHEL FERON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jerry Jones gets added to the list of failures, next up the former
editor of <i>Moeshoeshoe</i>, along with Michel Liesnard one of the 
founders of the Belgian Diplomacy hobby.
If you read <i>Diplomacy World</i> #101 you will 
quickly figure out why I chose Michel Feron to search for next.
There are a host of clues on the Internet that I found, so he 
could be very easy to find. 
Go for it, you have until Issue #320.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am running out of people on MY list of who to search for, so
I am looking for ideas, who would you like to find?
Send me some names.
I will likely go into all these szines that Doug Kent is posting
and find some more szine editors to search for, that's
what I usually do, but I'd like to find people that some of you
will search for or want to find!!!
This actually is giving me a HUGE number of possible ideas for
people to search for, but I can be focused or induced.
Come on, help me out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jerry, Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jerry Jones or Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no
ISE.
If anyone still needs assistance with this, though, since I'm helping
John out, like if you're in a foreign country and need to send dollars
for dipping things to someone in the US, I may be able to help you out.

The NEW Hobby Awards Committee is Jim Burgess (Chair and Treasurer),
Fred Davis, Jr., Melinda Holley, Andy York, Jack McHugh
Paul Kenny, Mark Stretch, and Robert Lesco.
I was going to publish the award ballot for this year 
in this issue, but I realized that I really just had to get this out first and
then do that.... and then, well, REAL SOON NOW!!!
And when I do, I'm going to give out three sets of awards and get caught up for the 
missed years, that seems to make the most sense.  
Committee.... you will be hearing more from me soon!
This also fell apart with my move, but I think I can get it together for next
issue when all the games are in Winter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Diplomacy World</i> Issue Deadlines are now:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Winter 2009, Issue #104: beginning of January; theme is
Worldwide Variants, we will have articles on Colonia VIIb, Known World 901,
and many more.  A new <i>DW</i> Demo Game in Known World 901 will also start, 
this variant is one of those David Cohen designed variants and it already has
been pretty extensively playtested.  If any of you are interested in playing,
let me know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Spring 2009, Issue #105: beginning of April; theme is "The
Endgame", what have you always wanted to know or read about about end game 
strategy, we'll feature it here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Summer 2009, Issue #106: beginning of July; theme is 
"Historical Variants" from pre-1900.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Fall 2009, Issue #107: beginning of October; theme is
"Balance of Power", arguably the key concept in all of Diplomacy, Eric Hunter,
Doug and I just realized that there are NO good articles around that actually
describe it.  The founder of the feast, Mr. Calhamer, of course has written on
it a couple of times, but he has, well, a singular view.  I hope we get a lot
of excellent articles on this topic, I'm writing one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
These last few issues have been really tremendous, if you've not looked at them 
yet, go look!
And for any issue, we're taking articles on ANY subject, let us know!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.diplomacyworld.net/ for some exciting back issue material being
posted as well as the new Issues, including the monstrous Issue #100.  
Highlights of #100 include Walt Buchanan's ex-wife Carol showing us who REALLY
was in charge of the hobby back in the Hoosier Archives days, Eric Ozog augmenting
the oft-heard, but never get enough of, love story between Eric and Cathy,
and the start of the new Diplomacy World Demo Game.

We were running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but might next issue.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: 
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.  
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.

What I did for my summer vacation by Paul Rauterberg</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think that every gradeschool kid had to write an essay entitled 
"What I did for my Summer Vacation".  Well, I went to gradeschool....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As most of you have heard, I went to Toronto to attend my niece's wedding,
and to visit with my brother John and his family there.
My Dad and I had great flights both ways on Midwest Express; no delays whatsoever.  
Our luggage was not searched, although our shoes were xrayed.  
(Hey, we got some practice with shoes on and off; at my bro's place, 
the practice was de rigeur before stepping on his brand new carpet.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My niece Marie made a gorgeous bride (I wish that I had had a BABE for a 
high school teacher; those kids in Toronto had better appreciate it!) 
and her new husband is a great guy.
The wedding reception turned out to be, um, a real trip on its own.  
It started out to be a little on the sedate side until the dinner and 
cake were served.  After the mandatory husband/wife, bride/father, 
groom/mother dances, 6 guys were suddenly "drafted" from the audience; 
number six picked was... guess who.
We stood out on the dance floor, waiting for the shoe to drop.  
Were we going to have do demo stag dancing?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then they handed out fake guitars to the first 5 guys, and 
I was delivered a fake (thank god) microphone.  
We would be doing a rendition of Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode.
Mercifully, they had picked a tune that I knew all the words to!  
With the first riff, I loosened up a bit by shaking my hips 
(a la Elvis) and drew some screams from the girls in the audience.  
My guitarists cut loose
(I was kind of lucky not to be an air guitarist this time; I might 
have fallen flat on my face trying to do the "duck walk") and we were a hit.
Now I was noticed, and received many invitations to dance from girls half 
my age.  Hey, not a bow-wow in the bunch....  Near the end of the evening, 
two of those babes told me that they were best friends and could never be separated.
Thinking fast, I said "well, then how about my marrying BOTH of you?"  
This elicited giggles, of course, but they never said "no"....  
One of them even emailed the bride the next morning to tell her about it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not all my dance partners were single, of course, but they were possessed 
of lazy husbands and needed stand-ins to cut the rug with.  
Gar, you know about me and "other guys' girls"....
I forever expected to feel a tap on my shoulder from some guy, 
saying "can I have my wife back now?"  Never happened.
One of those married women was from Northern Ireland, but she spoke with
a (to me) dull Canadian accent.  Half way through our dance, I ventured to tell
her "ah, but you're a fine lass love" in my best Dublin accent.  After that, her
speech was pure Belfast.  Cool as it gets.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received many invitations to "not be such a stranger" to Toronto, and I
couldn't imagine wanting to be.  (My brother has already invited me back 
for Christmas, and I have instructed him to "pass the word" that 
"Uncle Paul" will be back.  Especially to my 2 `fiancees'....  
John growled "they're half your age" but I just reminded him that the 
2 of them added up to an age close to mine.  Ahem.  You had to have been there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The day after the reception, I was met by a neighbor of my brother's, 
who happens to be Jamaican.  He thought that it was "all right, man" that I knew all
the words to Johnny B Goode, and awarded me with a complete Jamaican dinner 
(Jerk Chicken, Oxtail Stew, and elegantly done catfish).  To my intense pleasure, no
one else in the family had the guts to join me in eating Jamaican food - I had
it all to myself.  Yummy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Every moment of this weeklong vacation was a blast and then some.
Looking around Toronto, I had to wonder "what housing slump?"  
The place is filled with 25-30 story apartment/condo complexes under construction.  
Many houses there, though, are strange.  
They're as narrow as my current apartment, just longer.  
And they sell for over $300,000.  Oy.

A few quick notes on MLB 2008:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nathan, at age not-quite-6, got to do his first
trash-talking last night.  A White Sox fan, he has 2 uncles and a cousin
who are die-hard Twins fans.  So as we watched the 9th I
mentioned to him that Matt, Uncle Mike and Uncle Steve all liked the
Twins.  He asked if we could send them an email.  I told him we could,
and asked him what he wanted to say.  He said, Nyah, nyah, na-nyah,
nyah.  I expect some tension at the next family reunion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that this is the first time that the Cubs have made the
postseason 2 years in a row since 1906-1907-1908.  Its also the
first time the Cubs &amp; White Sox made the postseason the same year since
1906.  I have no idea what any of that signifies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  Cubs beat Dodgers 3-0.  Manny gets laughed
out of Chicago for having a Princess Leia haircut.  Phils beat Brewers 3-1,
because Sabathia can't pitch every game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Boston is out of players.  Angels win
3-0.  All signs point to the Rays over the White Sox.  So I'll
take Chicago 3-1.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Phils win the first 2, Cubs win the next 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  White Sox win 1 game on hitting, 1 on
pitching.  Angels win the other 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Cubs win in 5, and hand the lovable loser
tag over to the Mets, who badly need a consolation prize.

The Cubs were in the playoffs last year?  :)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS: Cubs over Dodgers 3-1.  Dodgers win one game with Orel Hershiser pitching
when Kirk Gibson limps in and hits a clutch HR in the 9th.  
Brewers over Phillies 3-2 because somehow the Phillies lose a 
game to somebody other than CC Sabathia.  Which lets him pitch twice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS: Rays over White Sox 3-2.  Home teams hold serve.  Sox over Angels 3-1.  
Even though the Angels have a better record, their starters have not been pitching
well lately.  Also, I think K-Rod's arm is about to fall off.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS: Sox over Rays in 6.  Did you think I'd pick the <i>Rays</i>?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS: Cubs over Brewers in  6.  CC only pitches twice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series: when a black man from Chicago is elected President, 
all bets are off.  The Cubs winning the World Series?  
Not even remotely weird for the rest of
the shit going on in the US this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But you don't expect me to pick against the Sox, do you?  :)  Boston in 7.

<i>((Hi all, I've been working all day, so I don't know what's happened so far,
though I see that the Red Sox have played the first inning with no score.
I think that Dodgers beat Cubs 3-2, and unfortunately for all right
thinking baseball fans, Manny WILL be a clutch performer in this series.
Phillies over Brewers 3-2 because CC Sabathia isn't that perfect.
White Sox over Rays 3-2, because the Rays just won't be able to keep it
going and the White Sox are on a roll.
Red Sox over Angels 3-1, because if they go back to Anaheim (yes, Anaheim)
for a game five the Angels will win.
Dodgers beat the Phillies 4-2, again because Manny smells the Red Sox.
Red Sox beat White Sox 4-1, because they need to beat Manny.
Red Sox beat Manny and the Dodgers 4-0 because the Red Sox this decade
never lose WS games.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Tue, 7 Oct 2008 07:10:54 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fresh off my 1-for-4 performance of round 1 (which puts me even with the
Angles, Brewers and White Sox and ahead of the Cubs) I fearlessly stride
into my bold predictions for the LCS.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Having watched as much baseball as I could the past round (which was
probably all of 36 innings' worth) I'm now starting to believe in
conspiracy theories.  The round 1 results make so little sense that
someone or some set of someone's has to be guiding the results.  Maybe
the Rays were a better team than the White Sox, but under no
circumstance can you say the same for the Angels/Red Sox, the
Cubs/Dodgers and probably the Brewers/Phillies series.  The outcomes
just do not make sense.  I can understand one team having a bad week,
but not all 3.  So there is a vested interest someplace that is
interfering with the outcomes.  In cases like this it's usually best to
just follow the money, in which case the answer is easy:  the MLB front
office and the TV networks.  What better story line to pitch than a Red
Sox versus the evil Manny World Series?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With that figured out the LCS' are easy to predict:  the Rays and
Phillies don't win 3 games between them.  Sorry guys, but the Red Sox
will drag all of New England (pro) and all of the NY Metro area (con)
into the ratings, and the Dodgers will drag what there is of a fan base
(bigger than the Lakers', so it's statistically significant) into it as
well.  The "jilted-lover" angle will pull in much of the rest of the
country.  Add in a few bench-clearing brawls in the WS (following a few
high, inside fastballs to the outfielder scorned and subsequent
retaliation) and you have the potential for the biggest ratings since
baseball was an honest game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So the question becomes:  who would MLB rather have win?  Game 7 (a
given) will be at Boston.  Would it be better to have Manny sulk off the
field, vowing revenge, while his former teammates celebrate behind him,
or have him celebrate on the field with his new teammates while the
crowd boos lustily?  I'm guessing the latter.  Dodgers win 4-3.  Boston
makes the playoffs in '09 anyway, so they'll have another shot at Manny,
wherever he is, during that postseason.

Tonight is one of those games where

tonight and then we both can return to the cold, dank fall into winter....))</i>

Apparently the Red Sox need to look for a sign in Florida to burn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I get too much of my sports information from ESPN (which is not as bad
as those getting their economic or political information from there, but
I digress) and thus have felt deluged with the notion that the Rays can
no longer possibly win the ALCS this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who is starting for the Sox in game 6?  How have his last few starts
gone?  What's an &#246;blique" anyway?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I turned on the game in the bottom of the first, saw that the Sox were already
down 2-0, and went shopping.  On the way back home, I turned on the radio 
and heard the announcers declare that, not only had the Rays had 10 HRs in 
3 games, but now they had 13 in 4 games.  When I got home, I got to see 
Papelbon let the last two Rays' runs score.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And then I started play Facebook poker while the game was on in the other room.  
I heard a surge for the first run, and then the crowd erupted for the 
Ortiz HR.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Decided to quit poker and watch during the 8th.  
The Coco Crisp at-bat was fabulous.  I had to wonder how well he could 
hit if he would show that much focus all the time.  
(I don't think he'd be riding the pine.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((As I'm not sure if most people know, Coco struggles legitimately with
mental illness difficulties.  When he really, really is able to
concentrate, as he was here, he really is great.  Other times he gets down
on himself and has difficulties.  We of course wish him the best and root
for him all the more because of it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And of course the Rays can win this series, and should be favored in Game 6.
Beckett is not well and cannot pitch like he did in 2007.  The most we can hope
is that he uses his brain to compensate for his lack of velocity, and 
that somehow the Sox get to Shields.  I think it's a long shot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, I think that's right.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But if the Sox do win Game 6, I would think they'd have to be favored in Game
7.  Garza couldn't possibly get the massive strike zone he got in Game 3 
one more time.

TV......))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Coming back in the morning, moving from the disappointing to the stupendous,
Sarah Palin appeared to me to mostly just stand around.  I thought Tina Fey's
comment in the press this week that if Palin won she'd have to leave.... the

suggests some degree of trepidation in various quarters about her appearance.
And she really didn't do much there or on Weekend Update except smile.))

to be in the driver's seat tonight, and there I think I will stop and
get this szine out in the E-Mail and on the web so we can get going again.

be that good again, nor for Jon Lester to be that bad.  Anything can
happen, but I am hopeful.  And then, the Phillies have the dreaded

<b>SPY DIPLOMACY RULES (Variant, revised Dec. 1986) by Jim Burgess</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Unless otherwise specified, the standard rules of Diplomacy apply.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Players receive adjudications for their own armies and fleets, but not
the armies and fleets of other powers.  Similarly, each player sees only
his or her own section of the supply center chart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) In addition to the standard units, an unit called a &#223;py" is added.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Each of the seven powers begins with a spy in each home supply center.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies are supplied only by home supply centers (i.e. Russia may have
as many as four spies at a time while other powers are limited to a maximum
of three).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies are "built" and "disbanded" in Winter seasons at the same time
as other units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) There is no limit to the number of spies that may be present in any
province and spies may be "stacked" with armies or fleets (exceptions are
listed in Rule 6).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Spy Reports

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spies report the location and nationality of armies and fleets in
the province they occupy and all adjacent provinces immediately following
the standard Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons (i.e. just prior to
the spy movement seasons).  Spies can differentiate between units in retreat
and successful attackers when two units &#246;ccupy" a province.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies also report the nationality of spies in the province they occupy
and the presence (but not nationality) of spies in adjacent provinces at the
same time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Movement of Spies

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spy movement follows the collection of spy reports, so orders to spies
may be made conditional on any information gathered by spies on opposing troop
movements or the adjudication of one's own units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies move after each of the following standard seasons: Winter,
Spring, Summer, and Fall (note that all spy movements PRECEDE Autumn
retreats), beginning with Winter 1900.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies move as armies do with the following exceptions:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Spy movements cannot be stood off by movements of any other unit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spies may be convoyed by fleets of any power during any of the
four movement seasons for spies.  The convoy orders for fleets in these
seasons must be ordered by their owner in the usual fashion or else the spy
convoy movement fails of execution.  Fleet convoy orders for spies may be made
in addition to regular Spring and Fall moves (note, however, that the fleets
themselves never move during spy movement seasons).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spies may also be "picked up" and carried by fleets of any
power. Embarkation and debarkation are moves that must be made during a
spy movement season and "permission to board" is not required.  Embarkation
consists of a movement from a land province to an adjacent sea province
containing a fleet.  Debarkation consists of a movement from a sea province
containing a fleet to an adjacent land province.  A spy may not &#223;witch
fleets in midstream".  Once boarded, a spy may only get off by debarking.
After boarding a fleet, the spy moves with the fleet during regular movement.
A spy may not debark from a fleet awaiting retreat (e.g. if a fleet carrying
a spy is dislodged in Spring, the spy may not debark until the spy movement
season following the standard Summer retreat season).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) Spy Mortality

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) This rule will outline the circumstances under which spies may be
captured or killed.  Spies may be disbanded in Winter seasons at the same
time as other units to meet the requirement that a power may not have more
spies than the number of currently held home supply centers and spies are
annihilated when they are on board a fleet that retreats off the board.
Otherwise, spies may only be removed from the board (there is no difference
in the game between capturing and killing a spy, but players should feel
free to delineate between the two states in writing press) immediately
following the four spy movement seasons.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies killed or captured in a given season do not submit written
spy reports for that season, though their final movement may have been
made conditional on that spy report.  Players may never know for sure how
a spy was lost, just as in real life.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies are "killed" by being assassinated by other spies.  When a
spy moves, he or she may attempt an assassination, specifying the nationality
of spies to be executed if discovered.  Each spy may hunt for only one
nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
will govern the adjudication of assassinations:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) A spy may attempt an assassination without moving (for instance
if the target is in the same province).  In this case, any spies of the target
nationality that end the spy movement phase in that province are assassinated
with one exception.  If the spy attempting the stationary assassination is
himself or herself assassinated by a moving assassin then that spy
assassinates no one in that season (not even a potential target other than the
one that assassinates that spy).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) A spy attempting a moving assassination (may include a move of
embarkation or debarkation from a fleet) is always successful in assassinating
spies of the target nationality that finish the spy movement phase in the
province that the spy moves to.  This makes "mutual assassinations" possible.
          c) Example: French spy is on board a French fleet in the Channel.
An English spy is in London.  Both powers specify assassination attempts
against the spies of the other.  If the English spy embarks on the French
fleet in the channel (remember that embarkation does not require the
permission of the fleet being boarded) and the French spy doesn't move, the
French spy is killed, but the English spy isn't (he may be immediateIy
captured, however, see part D).  If a German spy is also on board and the
French spy tried to assassinate the German spy, that operation would fail
as well. If the French spy debarks to London at the same time, the two spies
"pass in the night" and neither is killed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) Spies are "captured" by opposing armies and fleets.  Players may
attempt to capture spies, specifying the nationality of spies to be captured
if discovered.  Each army and fleet on the board may search for spies of one
nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
will govern the adjudication of attempts to capture spies:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Players may specify a nationality to be hunted separately for
each unit or they may issue blanket searches to be applied to all units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) At the end of the spy movement phase, any spies of the
nationality specified in the same province are captured (for example, if
the French player specifies a hunt for English spies on their Channel fleet
in the above example, then the English spy is captured).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Players are informed when they successfully capture an opposing
spy.  Note that the &#246;wner" of the spy, however, is not informed of the
capture.  Communication just is cut.  This rule is the only exception to the
generaI rule that armies and fleets are blind.  It is possible to play the
game without allowing capture of spies by armies and fleets if one wishes
to allow freer movement of spies (i.e. RuIe D may be ignored).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7) It is suggested that the game be adjudicated in four separate seasons
in the following order:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spring: (for Spring 1901 this sequence is preceded by a spy movement
phase (no spy reports are necessary) followed by assassinations or captures)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard movement by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Summer:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard retreats by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Fall:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard movement by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) Winter:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard Autumn retreats by fleets and armies, adjudication
reported only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Standard Winter builds and removals, also applies to spies

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          e) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can we get back to these game openings below?  
We just need a few more people for a couple of these.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game of REGULAR Diplomacy if there is enough interest!!!
Doug Kent, Fred Wiedemeyer, Brad Wilson, and Shaun Thompson start the list, who would like to join them???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'm publishing the rules again this issue!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.
Harold has been updating the Diplomacy A to Z, go check it out at:
http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/index.html 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, Steve Koehler, Art Schleinkofer,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, and Dave Partridge are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, we only need TWO more!
Only two, just TWO more...... come on.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1)  Well, that didn't work so well.  As Jeff O'Donnell had to leave
and I had to pull in multiple standbys, I had this E-Mail from this
guy Heath Gordon who wanted to join, we exchanged a whole series of 
E-Mails, but then..... he's gone.
Mike Barno takes over.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB LAMENTS): I know, I know, we've got press stories and they are spread out
and hard to follow, go look up the last few issues to get caught up.
I know there are others who want to write more press, we'll stay on track now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 7 (Dark Press - not for attribution)):
Me and the nun with the gun on the run

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, the door exploded with a mighty crash and we fell together as one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The gunmen rushed in a deadly dash, and tried to cut us down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And the first one said to the second one there, I hope you brought a gun

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It was me and the nun with the gun on the run.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And the plug ugly and the button man were searching every one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For me and the nun with the gun on the run... nun on the run.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh seeing no one else had come

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And a bell was ringing in the Hobby square for the hares on the run.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It was me and the nun with the gun on the run.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And the plug ugly and the button man were searching every one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For me and the nun with the gun on the run... nun on the run."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wouldja quit singing that," snapped Charly, "dose arent even da' words."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Maybe not," I conceded, "they just seemed to fit." 
We were beating a hasty retreat, it wouldnt take long for the plug uglies to 
beat it down the stairs and out the front of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>.  
I intended to be pages away by then.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You dont shoot bad for a dame," I said to Charly, trying to butter her up. 
She'd hiked the gun up inside the trench coat that covered her bare assets, 
so as it couldn't be seen by passers by. 
A naked blonde with a tommy gun just might attract a little attention ...even in the Hobby.
We got around the back corner of Macgillicutty's fast, 
we could hear music spilling out into the alley with the trash and the cats.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Sounds jazzy," said Charly, "who's playing?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Twenty three tunes."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Is dat the band, or what they play?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I have no idea."  We rounded the corner and pounded 
feet down the street for the old <i>Graustark</i> szine.  
If we could get around that those palookas wouldn't be sure which way we went.  
The blond had a nice pair of getaway sticks and was putting them to good use.  
We were under the gothic overhang without hearing any shots, 
or feeling the bite of hot lead.  I gave a mental sigh of relief.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So whats da' next brilliant move in yer master plan?" asked Charly, 
she was catching her breath, her bosom heaving.  I was enjoying the show.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You tell me, sister.  You're the one said there used to be a zoo."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse still on that zoo idea... dat is the dumbest lead I have ever heard."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Swell, then we'll go with your idea," I said.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I don' have an idea," she answered archly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, that was sort of my point."

1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We have I) Concession to Turkey; II) AEIT draw; and III) Expulsion of 
Ozog/Replacement player for Ger (Reason: Tallman is ambulatory and should 
have resumed play much earlier) on the table as proposals.
All of these are rejected.
There are no new proposals as of yet.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CREDO): Water will play high, since his only way to
not get a 3 risks dragging two or three riders from
three different teams behind him.  Hedging against my
guess by splitting my riders is a great way to play
for third.  Even if I get it wrong, I should have one
more chance for the big cards needed to keep up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SINGS BACK TO CREDO): Yes, the water went very high.
Interesting pack formation now..... and your packmen did
get some decent cards.
