<br /><br />Yes, we're late again, I'll say more below, but I've had some energy issues related to losing
weight as a side effect.  From the beginning of all of this, I've lost 1/4 of my body weight...
sigh, on the good side, I am now gaining a bit.
But this was late as a result.  I'm going to still try to make this a quick turnaround since 
everyone should be able to deal with that since I sent the Diplomacy retreats out in advance.
Let me know if you have problems or questions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website when I fix the new website index.html
at http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html, almost there.
All the back issues are there in http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/TAPxxx.pdf or .html.
My poor html programming is making the move to diplomatic-pouch.com more problematic since I hardcoded
links in.  Sigh...
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> which is running down to a fold.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />YOU can still join Kendo Nagasaki, hop in!!!
But it's ALMOST over... I'll probably get final TotalCon results in next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i> in
<i>NSWG</i> #16, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  
Since Terry's passing, we lose our thirty year fervent hope that someday <i>NSWG</i>
would have been resurrected and I could go back and swear my fealty to the Toadfather.
The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more,
especially when I feel better.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.
Especially since after ES's impending fold, we will be independent again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I'm having trouble with the new upload interfaces.  
I'll get it fixed as soon as I can.
I need to stay within the security of the site (which is very important!!!!)
while getting access to change the web site's index and files for the szine.
It shouldn't be that hard, but my first, second, and third attempts didn't work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The general website address is now:
http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 77 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, which is
starting to come back up, I hope.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the current list website, but that
particular site may not come back in the rebuild.
YOU needed to make sure you're on this list, I'll let you know when I'm using it again.
I'll add some of the newer subscribers who aren't there when I do that. 
When this works,
there you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, I see that does help.
Please let me know about other issues, but it puts priority on getting the link up again.
Apologies for the recent confusions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ok Jim-Bob, I'll give it a shot.  I'd have written earlier but I got caught up in the rapture last November, and it took a long time for them to realize the mistake, and then a longer time to process the paperwork to send me back.  Still, I think it was worth it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL:  I see 7 teams that won't do much, and 8 that will contend.  I think it goes like this...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  Hard to believe that Big Papi is gone and teaching tennis, and still everyone thinks this made the Red Sox somehow better.  Tough division, but I see as Blue Jays, Red Sox, Yankees, Rays and Chokeartists.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  Do the Indians suffer like a Super Bowl loser?  I've got a lot of friends in the Cleveland area that fear this a lot.  I'll say Tigers, Indians, Royals, White Sox, Twins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  Looks like Houston is back.  I will say Astros, Rangers, Mariners, Angels, A's.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wild Cards:  Tough call here.  I think the Rangers, Mariners and Indians just miss, and the Red Sox and the Yankees (with a last minute spending spree and September run) get the spots.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Blue Jays over Astros.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL:  I'm not sure anyone other that the 5 playoff teams that made it last year have any hope this year.  So...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Mets, Nats, Marlins, Phillies, Braves.  Braves' attendance total for the year is just south of 200,000.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Cubs, Pirates, Brewers, Cards, Reds.  Despite a showy start, the Cardinals are worse this year than last.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Dodgers, Giants, Rockies, Diamondbacks, Padres.  Anyone picking Arizona to make the playoffs will be forced to share what they've been smoking.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wild Cards:  Giants and Nats.  I still don't believe in Washington.  Call it the "Dusty Effect".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Cubs over Dodgers.  Might be the two best teams in baseball.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  It has been 109 years since the Cubs repeated as WS Champs.  This year they break the curse, and do it at Wrigley.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Goz, warrengoesle of wowway.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Thanks, Goz, here's my take.  I do think the biggest challenge with baseball is changing the CULTURE of speed of the game.
Jim Kaat proved 40 years ago, that if you're committed to pitching when you get the ball, you can get games under two hours.
The dumbest idea I've ever heard is starting someone at second base in extra innings... first off, it breaks every tradition of
baseball, and no one is worried about extra innings games going long, that's exciting, as we experienced in the early Red Sox
extra inning game.  But you don't do it with rules, at least in the majors.  You create a culture in training and in the minor
leagues of quick turnaround of pitches, no stepping out, no adjusting batting gloves (yes, you too, Dustin Pedroia!), and then
the games will move faster.  But that will take a decade or more.  Let's start now.  Start in Single A with really draconian rules
that affect how young players start their careers, and then slowly move it up the chain.  And then you won't even have to change
the rules in the majors! My take differs a lot from Goz in some places, and not at all in others.  I think the Red Sox will be the
AL East team, and Goz thinks it will be the Blue Jays, we agree that is a huge question for the season.  The NL is REALLY split between
a small group of "haves" and the rest having essentially no chance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: The Red Sox WILL overcome the loss of Big Papi with the best young outfield in baseball.
Red Sox, Blue Jays, Yankees, Orioles, Rays; Blue Jays a wild card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: I have much more faith in the Indians, but it is interesting that Dave Dombroski really built both the 
Tigers and the Red Sox... and I think at least one of the reasons the Red Sox traded Yoan Moncada to the Chicago White Sox
was his Twinkie addiction, which keeps him on a sugar high for now, but eventually?  The White Sox sent him to AAA
and he has had SEVEN hits in the first two games.  Will the Red Sox regret it?  Not eventually, and Chris Sale is great.
Indians, Tigers, Royals, White Sox, Twins; Tigers a wild card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: Mostly boring teams, don't care much, but let's go with this.  Astros, Mariners, Rangers, A's, Angels.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS: Why not have the two best teams play each other.  Red Sox beat Blue Jays.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: It looks like they will rebuild that highway in Atlanta where the fire was quickly,
but as far as Braves games go, no one will notice any traffic, since no one will come. Mets, Nationals, Marlins, Phillies, Braves;
Nationals are a wild card.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: Yes, the Cubs and then NOTHING. Cubs, Pirates, Reds, Cardinals, Brewers. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: My Giants are going to be really, really good, despite an obnoxious start, and the bad teams in this division are just bad.
Giants, Dodgers, Rockies, Diamondbacks, Padres; Dodgers are a wild card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS: Cubs narrowly edge the Giants.  Dodgers aren't as good as Goz thinks they are...  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS: Red Sox sweep the Cubbies and put them in their place!))</i>

Especially with Doug Kent bowing out, is there some other Variant in which there is interest?
Please ask!!!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Some of you, like Rick, don't have fully realized Team and Rider names.  You aren't wedded to the
Diplomacy countries, though some of you stayed in that domain.
Get them to me next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Note the overcrowding rule for the first turn.
First turn only - if at the end of the first turn (only), any square has 5 or more cyclists on it then 
the square in front is treated as if were blank for card replacement purposes.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
So we have a bit of a bad bout going on with the cancer lately, so this is late.  
My apologies.
I'd like to push the next issue out right away, but we'll see.
The diplom.org site is moving to diplomatic-pouch.com, but that is causing issues with internal links, especially for me.
I hope to get this figured out soon for TAP and somehow I will.
We're hunting for a new treatment for me, preferably one in the immunotherapy category, wish me luck, I think I'm going to
need it.
My general spirits are still good, and dropping this latest chemotherapy that isn't working should take away those side
effects, which are particularly annoying.
Since I may need to be getting rid of records and szines and hobby history soon, it is good that we're hearing again
