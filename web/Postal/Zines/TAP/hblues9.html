<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I>US Airways at the Brink</I></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There's no doubt that the free market can be brutal. 
Companies that can't define their reason for existence in the 
market place face a tough go of it. Even having a famous name 
doesn't guarantee success, as Kmart has discovered. While 
Kmart's problem amounts to being caught between Wal-Mart and 
Target in the hypercompetitive low end mass retail market, 
businesses in other sectors that can't adapt to changing 
markets face an equally questionable future. Among those appears 
to be US Airways.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">US Airways recently made headlines with its $1 
billion fourth quarter loss and a loss for the year nearing $2 
billion. While it would be simple to blame Sept. 11 and the 
ensuing flight restrictions at Washington National Airport for much 
of the airlines losses, that would be unfair. US Airways lost 
nearly another $1 billion during the first nine months of 2001.  
The carrier, despite being the sixth biggest U.S. airline and 
flying over 300 jets, has never really been able to present a 
business model that assured consistent profitability. Instead it has 
merely adopted economic models from others in the industry, and 
made ineffective use of them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">US Airways problems began in the late 1980s, when 
US Air bought Piedmont and PSA. The mergers were part of 
a widespread consolidation in the airline industry, based on 
an oligopolistic theory of cost &#173; that a bigger business will 
have lower costs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the airline industry faces not one big 
market but a mass of smaller markets. The expanded then-US 
Air was a mess. Its route structure, with major hubs in 
Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Baltimore and smaller 
operations in Dayton, Syracuse, and Indianapolis, competed against 
itself. What had been PSA, meanwhile, was an isolated 
operation on the West Coast. That arrangement might have 
worked it US Air had taken on bigger carriers in the 
transcontinental market. With only six planes larger than a 727, that wasn't 
an option. What USAir was flying was virtually every sort of 
80 to 140 seat jetliner in existence, creating serious spare 
parts, training, and crewing problems for the airline. High labor 
cost combined short flight lengths also produced among the 
highest cost per seat-mile flown in the airline industry. 
<TD COLSPAN=1>
<TD COLSPAN=1 HEIGHT=588 WIDTH=246 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After bleeding red ink and downsizing for a number 
of years, US Airways finally became a modestly profitable 
operation by the mid-1990s. This is not to say its underlying 
problems had been solved; its now three big hubs (Charlotte, 
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh) still compete against themselves to 
a degree and the airline still had too many different types 
of planes. US Airways major routes were also becoming 
increasingly competitive, with low fare Southwest Airlines 
becoming a player in the mix. It's just that US Airways rode a 
strong economy into again having some freedom of action, 
enough cash and credit to transform itself into something other 
than what it was. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its choice was to again follow the market, this time 
by forming a low fare division as United and Delta had done 
to battle Southwest head on. In addition, the fleet would be 
rejuvenated with a major buy of Airbus jets, the one plane type 
it did not own to date. (Perhaps the goal all along was to 
make the airline healthy enough to be bought out by a bigger 
carrier; United, of course, was willing to buy but the Justice 
Department said no.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, like the early acquisition spree, this 
also turned out to be a bust. US Airways' low fare division, 
called MetroJet, was a flop and unable to compete effectively in 
the market place. Indeed, its elimination was one of the main 
cuts the airline made following the Sept. 11 attack. This is not 
to say that the rest of US Airways is anything close to 
profitable; it's not.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faced with a more desperate situation now, US Airways 
is again restructuring. The key this time is seen to be 
increasing the number of smaller jets the carrier's commuter affiliates 
fly. In recent years, commuter airlines have replaced 
turboprops with smaller jets  called regional jets, which seat up to 70 
 on many routes. These planes can also replace mainline jets 
on certain routes as well, making them a contentious issue in 
labor negotiations. US Airways' pilot union contract allows 
the commuters to fly only 70 of the jets. US Airways sees 
increasing this number substantially, as other carriers such as 
Delta and Continental have already done, as a means to regain 
profitability. US Airways is pushing the issue very hard; it's 
even retiring its 40 Fokker 100 jets, the smallest plane in its fleet.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether merely doing what everyone else in the 
industry is already doing will save US Airways is questionable, 
&quot;Me Too&quot; rarely carries the day in any market. An even in the 
airline industry, there's a limit to how long a carrier can bleed 
red ink. US Airways is not at the end of days yet, but unless it 
can define a reason to exist, its future is just as questionable 
as Kmart's.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Kevin Wilson:</I> This is certainly my worst showing since 
the first game or two I've played of Outpost. I just didn't see 
any Scientist come up once I had the necessary DLs to give me 
a shot of taking it cheap and once I got behind I never had 
a chance to catch up. The last time I went the DL/Sci route 
it worked. I'll have to keep this game in mind. 
Congratulations to Harry on a very nice late turn surge for the win. It was 
close until the end and the cards must have fallen his way to 
get those 2 MBs. I promise to provide a greater challenge 
next time. Sign me up for your next Outpost game. I might as 
well keep trying until I learn to do it right!
