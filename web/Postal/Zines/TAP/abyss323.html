<br /><br />This issue is dedicated with great affection and appreciation to Heather Taylor, Doug Kent's
wife, who is celebrating her birthday this week. 
She also has just won the Deviant Dip II game "Black Licorice" in Doug's subszine 
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i>.  Heather is a wonder, and not just because she puts up with Doug.
I am pleased that she won the Deviant Dip game and pleased to be able to dedicate
this issue to her.
I also hereby make Doug lose any bets he made that this issue would not come out this week.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! 
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.
I'm playing Dip all over the place, and although Andy Lischett is going to try tos 
catch me, there just isn't that much call for a large postal dipszine any more.
Andy is pretty tiny and so is Alex Richardson and most of the others still hanging
on postally.
If you hadn't heard, John Boardman at least temporarily has stopped <i>Graustark</i>,
the beast that puts us all to shame, but word is he wants to try to keep going.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's <i>Octopus' Garden</i> needs Railway Rivals players!!!
He now has three names for the France map opening (Bill McKinley has joined 
Geoff Challinger and William Whyte). 
So we now have just two slots left to fill before we have ourselves a gamestart. 
Make Peter's day and E-Mail him at: peter of burdonvale.co.uk and say you'll play!!!
Please, please, please!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We will have four subszines going forward, from Dave Partridge, Doug Kent, Andy York, and 
Peter Sullivan.  Dave Partridge still is trying to finish <i>Tinamou</i>, Andy York is working on 
By the WAY, and Peter just needs those Railway Rivals players!  
Doug of course puts us all to shame.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire szine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

<i>((I want to go back to encouraging more letters again, 
right now I'm going to focus on just pumping issues out, but I 
hope to start writing more again too as the year progresses.
We have something from Mike Barno this issue, plus the beginning of the
announcement of the Annual Baseball Predictions.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>((It's time for my annual baseball predictions.  These also are
being deposited with Doug Kent as part of what our <b>Eternal Sunshine</b>
subszine is doing more broadly for the same purpose.  Let's first
discuss each division in turn.
[I obviously wrote this a long time ago before the season started, I've
edited nothing....]))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League East: Theo Epstein continues to build the Red Sox
in such a manner as to win 95 games each year, this team is no exception.
Some years, 95 wins is enough to win the AL East, other times it is not.
This year, virtually all angles of the AL East are improving, so with so
many teams vying for victories, the Red Sox 95 wins will be sufficient to
win the division this year.  Since I follow and know the most about the
Sox, you get to read my thoughts here.  As I write, the six starters that 
they have assembled are likely to be really good, the best starting staff
in baseball.  Since Daisuke Matsuzaka was the one having some early spring
training injuries, he is the one who will start the season on the shelf.
Daisuke was a real disaster last year after blowing himself out in the 
World Baseball Classic.  Official digression, the World Baseball Classic 
is one of the biggest pieces of crap going.  After all the injury problems
it created last year (given that players are relatively clear of performance
enhancing drugs), I expect a big ruckus and uproar the next time it comes
around.  I'm not sure the idea works at all, but if it does, it needs to be 
scheduled during the Winter League seasons and annoying them, rather than
messing up spring training and make the unrelenting season too long for 
most players, especially pitchers.  I think Matsuzaka WILL come back and
pitch well before this season is over, but will ultimately lose more than
a season over the WBC experience.  Victor Martinez is arguably the best
catcher in the game, I hope the Sox hang onto Mike Lowell in the twilight 
of his career, everyone who thinks the Sox have wrong people in the wrong
places in the outfield will be proven dead wrong (Jacoby Ellsbury will have
an All-Star season in left, everyone who thinks J.D. Drew is overrated in
right is wrong again, and Mike Cameron will be one of the best if not the
best centerfielder in the American League, plus Jeremy Hermida will be a 
great backup - flexibility, speed, defense, and more offense than everyone
thinks is there), and the new infield also is possibly the best in the American
League.  I expect Big Papi to struggle some again, but I also expect Mike
Lowell to DH a great deal.  The relief corps is different from last year,
but if anything even better, the Boof Bonzer experience so far is a 
failure though.  I think any of the other four teams COULD be in any order
whatsoever, but will one of them be the Wild Card or will they just beat
each other up.  I vote for beating each other up.  The WS winning Yankees
will fall the most, I don't believe their starting pitching is as good as
they think it is, the new outfield will not jell, and the ageless Mariano
Rivera and Jorge Posada have to show their age some time and I say this is the 
year.  Joba Chamberlain will be in the bullpen to take up some of that
slack and could end up as the closer if Rivera completely falls apart.
Robinson Cano moves up into the number five slot in the lineup, which
seems too high for someone who hasn't proven to be a clutch RBI hitter.
I see them in third with a bullet moving downward.  In the second slot is
a rebound by Tampa Bay and the Rays.  Carl Crawford is going to be challenged
by Ellsbury as the best LF in baseball, but Crawford is still it.  The
key for the Rays is B.J. Upton and I think he will be great.  The Rays
could beat out the Red Sox, but I think they will be the Wild Card.
Toronto (Vernon Wells will make a comeback, but they don't have enough
pitching) and Baltimore (Brian Matusz will break out as a hot young
starter, but it won't be enough) round out the East, so the order is: 
Boston, Tampa Bay (WC), New York, Toronto, and Baltimore.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League Central: Signing Mauer was the right thing to do for 
Minnesota going into the season and the best hitting catcher in perhaps
baseball history will lead the Twins to the division title.  Losing Joe
Nathan for the season will be a big deal, but I think Francisco Liriano
is underrated and could take over, and if not, the Twins will do what is
needed to find someone.  
The White Sox are the hot choice, but I'm going to let Goz and others
choose them and I'll predict that the White Sox fall just short.
I was going to pick them as the Wild Card, but I think this division
is going to be lots more competitive than everyone else thinks it is
going to be, so that will leave the White Sox under 90 wins while 
Tampa Bay will have more than 90.
The White Sox have lots of pinch hitters and others playing DH by committee.
That will be interesting.
Detroit will challenge the Twins and 
White Sox all year, making
their rotation and a resurgeance of Magglio Ordonez the basis for a big
run, but I don't think it will be enough.  Somehow that Detroit pitching
just doesn't hold up for an entire year and it basically is that same 
staff back for another go.  Cleveland is intriguing.  Kerry Wood is going
to be the closer after he recovers.  Fausto Carmona looks like he's back.
I think this is enough to challenge with Detroit.  Let's predict that
Cleveland will surprise and finish third, with Detroit way back in fourth, 
but with a tight race all season, perhaps the tightest division in baseball.
The Royals are still the Royals but they are improving substantially and could
again scare the other four teams in the division.  Can Luke Hochevar join
Zack Greinke as the best one-two starting pitching duo in the league?
It is possible, while the Royals still lose.
The order, Minnesota, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and Kansas City.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League West: I am a huge Chone Figgins fan, and pretty much
for that reason alone, my allegiance for this division switches from 
the Angels (who aren't really from Los Angeles anyway) to the Mariners,
who really are a creature of downtown Seattle.  I also think Ken Griffey,
Jr. is one of the real good guys in the game and he deserves to see that
great playoff run, and with Seattle.  There is this board game guy that
they have to worry about, and the pitching questions on Cliff Lee and Erik
Bedard could generate a disaster of questions behind Felix, but I am still
going with them.
The Angels (that's all I'm going to call them) have more than you think,
Joe Saunders and Jered Weaver are going to be a great 1-2 starting pitcher
combo, and Howie Kendrick will be better without Chone Figgins rotating 
in behind him every once in a while, but second.  Texas is better, but
Ron Washington, the MANAGER, failed a drug test.  I can't root for these
guys, third place.  And the A's are a young disaster waiting to happen,
but they'll do it FAST and CLEAN.  This is the clinical depression recovery
team, with Coco Crisp and Justin Duchscherer.  I wish them well, but they
finish last in the division.
That would be Seattle, the Angels, Texas, and Oakland.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League East: When a team loses in the World Series, and makes
a whole bunch of changes to get better, and everyone picks them to go BACK
to the World Series, don't believe it.  It doesn't happen.  The Oakland
Athletics did it in 1989 after losing to the Dodgers in 1988, but that required
an EARTHQUAKE to get their Bay Area Series sweep over my Giants.  I am
going to bet against this.  Who wins instead?  Yes, Bobby Cox finishes off
a great career by leading the Braves in there.  I generally hate the Braves,
I hate the fans, I hate the ballpark, I hate that stupid cheer, but this
is a likable team.
The rotation has fun loving Derek Lowe, a healthy Tim Hudson, and the coolest
name in baseball, Jair Jurrjens.  The offense will be anchored by the rookie
Jason Heyward and the erratic Yunel Escobar, both of whom have been fighting
nagging Spring Training injuries, but that's why I'm picking them.  And I haven't
even mentioned Chipper Jones and Troy Glaus who will anchor the corners,
not the sexy choice, but the right choice.  The Phillies will finish second
with Roy Halladay and a NOT rebuilt Cole Hamels.
The Mets are going to be the disaster again (Luis Castillo is horrible,
Jason Bay is overrated even if he is a really nice guy, and Beltran is
already injured again), but will be saved from the basement
by the horrendous Nationals, who can't even play in Spring Training.
The Marlins, about whom I have no strong feelings, get stuck in the middle
of this division, but I'll probably be wrong about that one.  
So, that will be Atlanta, Philadelphia, Florida, New York, and Washington.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League Central: I like the Cardinals, you like the Cardinals, everyone
likes the Cardinals, well, they are just going to win the division going away,
in baseball's only bloated six team division.  Carpenter and Wainwright are
great starting pitchers; Pujols, Holliday, and Ludwick great hitters, and 
Colby Rasmus is going to blossom into a great CF this year.  They're the
pick.  Behind that is a host of questions.  Randy Wolf is not the solution
for the Brewers, just getting rid of Milton Bradley doesn't help the Cubs, the
Reds still have no hitting even if Chapman is a pitching wizard which he probably
won't be until next year, Brandon Lyon is the big addition for the Astros,
and there is still just a rookie test kitchen going on in Pittsburgh.
I think the Pirates actually beat out the Astros.  I hate evaluating
this division after St. Louis, but here we go, 
order is St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Houston.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League West: Yes, no wild card yet, the wild card WILL come from this
division, I think.  This means the Phillies don't even make the playoffs.  I like
four teams here, all but the Padres who will fall back into the basement after
they trade Adrian Gonzalez to someone mid season (not that it matters, I think
Gonzalez is overrated anyway).  Eeenie, meenie, miney, moe, the Rockies are the
trendy pick, so I'll go with them to repeat as the Wild Card, I think the
Giants will surprise everyone and take the division (of course, this is my
self serving pick since they're one of my favorite teams!).  I know Spring 
Training success is not a predictor of future performance, but they've been
tearing up the Arizona division of Spring Training.  Bengie Molina will be
helped by having rookie sensation Buster Posey spelling him (Molina played
way, way too much last year and hit cleanup, he's now hitting seventh).
Tim Lincecum isn't the only pitcher here, I think this is Barry Zito's comeback
year, Jonathan Sanchez can be more consistent and Matt Cain will not falter
late this time.  Plus they have this new guy Todd Wellemeyer who looks pretty
darn good.  The Rockies are solid and have a good humidor tested rotation for
the clouds up there in Denver.  Los Angeles is a mess, you can have Manny!
So Arizona will beat them out.  That leaves us with:
San Francisco, Colorado (WC), Arizona, Los Angeles, and San Diego.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League Playoffs: I do not think the Twins will do well here,
but any of the other three teams can go to the World Series.
I'm picking the Red Sox to go though, since, well, I have to!
I really think that the Seattle Mariners have a great shot though, and
I'll be rooting for them if the Red Sox falter.  
But Boston Red Sox are the pick, their rotation will be the best and the
deepest at that point in the season.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League Playoffs: Atlanta is my pick to win the division, but again
they are the easy odd team out for advancing.
I like the Giants to win the first round against the Braves, but then the
Cardinals will beat them to go to the World Series, I think it is their
year, the Giants will improve after they make a few more changes and let
these players settle in.
Colorado already had their surprise WS run.
St. Louis Cardinals are the pick to get a rematch of an earlier World Series
you might recall.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((World Series: The Red Sox swept the Cardinals that year, they probably won't 
quite do that again, but they will win easily.  Red Sox to win, yes, yet again
Jim-Bob plays the homer card.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((OK, well, I have to add SOMETHING today.
So, the Red Sox have been setting records for injuries and are still hanging
in there.
Does anyone doubt that my prediction might have made more sense if the team
that Theo had put together was actually playing this year?
It never was.
Daisuke didn't start the season, by the time he was back, Ellsbury was out,
and now Youkilis is out for the season too.
I still haven't given up, we true fans NEVER give up.
And baseball is still fun, it goes on and on and on like an Energizer Bunny.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno, 3/8/2010</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's time to carry on this zine's decades-old tradition of best-music-of-the-year articles.  
For me, 2009 brought almost no national big-name bands, but it was still one of my best 
years for music.  
That's because I got quite a lot of enjoyment from local bands and smaller regional bands 
visiting places that I could easily reach.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Last year, I had a few big themes about my 2008 music.  
None for 2009 except what the first paragraph says.  
Just some fun with a few festivals, and a bunch of shows by the half-dozen bands 
I followed, and a bunch of shows by bands I've enjoyed in past years enough to 
hear again, and a few shows by bands someone recommended, and a few shows 
listening to whomever happened to be playing wherever I was.  But that added up 
to at least thirty full gigs, parts of at least twenty others, and at least 
fifty sets of 40-60 minutes at festivals.  So that's collectively a lot of music, 
and since I enjoyed most of it enough to be quite glad I'd been there, it added 
up to a lot of good times for the year.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll start with the best recorded music I bought, because it is all by local 
or regional bands who also played in the counties where I live, work, and weekend.  
The best recorded music I bought is all independent, not the mass-market stuff from 
RIAA member companies.  (I still despise their attempts to enforce their old 
business through filesharer lawsuits and nasty DRM.)  In fact I picked up no 
corporate-owned music in 2009.  I got good value.  My first pick is Rally Day by 
the band Driftwood.  (They're on MySpace as slash driftwoodgroove.)  I barely 
mentioned them in my best-of-2008 article, among the bands I enjoyed at that 
year's West Fest.  Since then, they added a genuinely fine fiddler, developed 
some original songs to release-worthiness, and developed collaborations with 
various talented friends.  They bill their category as "shanty rock".  It's a 
variety, and sometimes a fusion, of bluegrass, "old-time", and various rock 
flavors such as blues-rock and groove.  Most of the live stuff, except some of
the songs off this CD, are either lively, up-tempo originals that make me 
bounce, or creative rearrangements of old (sometimes very old) songs that 
make me bounce whether I last heard them a week ago or thirty years ago.  
But this CD is mostly downbeat-feeling songs.  All ten are originals by Dan 
Forsyth and Joe Kollar, who have been playing together in different kinds 
of bands for years and years.  Most of the music here, even some faster 
songs like "Cigarette Addiction", have bitterness (a relationship 
likened to that title), or plaintiveness, or resignation in their feel and lyrics.  
The obvious exception is "Walking into the Sun", which gets the hippies 
and pagans grooving every show; the Binghamton newspaper's reviewer called it 
"shimmering".  "Talkin' Walmart" carries on the folk tradition 
(think Woody Guthrie) of social commentary via gospel-tinged spoken-word storytelling.  
"Tin Pan Momma" closes the album with a middle finger of defiance 
to the big record companies: "I'm gonna play what I want to play, 
I'm gonna sing what I want to sing," rather than "they want to wrap you 
in plastic and pretend that you're somebody else".  
All these songs show a lot of songwriting and performing skill.  
Most have complex interplay that makes a four-piece band (four on the 
CD, various counts at live shows) sound like an octet's worth 
of stuff going on.  The core of the band is Forsyth (on acoustic guitar 
or mandolin or harmonica or kazoo, and a lot of the lead vocals); 
Kollar, who usually plays banjo with a strange but effective clawhammer 
style instead of fingerpicks (but sometimes plays guitar, or hand 
drums or a snare drum or a chipboard box, and some lead vocals); 
and Claire Byrne, who plays some kick-ass, stomping-and-hollering 
fiddling when it's time for that, subtle and emotive when it's time 
for that.  Jon Doll plays stand-up bass on the album and at many live shows.  
Some shows feature other skilled friends such as Chris Merkley (harmonica, 
guitar), Taze Yanick (acoustic or electric guitar), JimmyJohn McCabe (guitar), 
or Nate Marshall (guitar, harmonica).  
Since Joe and Claire practiced at a backyard bonfire I was attending, 
I've heard them at least a dozen times, and I've been impressed and 
cheered every time.  I might have actually heard the detail best when 
they played inside a barn at an old-time-days fair.  This was their first 
CD but they're working on another; I'll probably like it even more than 
the first, based on the other originals I've heard them play, including 
fiddle tunes.  They provided me more truly new listening pleasure (not 
stuff I'd already heard the same or similar) than anyone else this year.  
They're from the Binghamton area but are traveling regionally; one December 
weekend included a Friday night cafe gig in Massachusetts, a Saturday morning 
live radio show spot in Connecticut, a Saturday night show at a tavern 
elsewhere in Connecticut, and their then-frequent Sunday night show 
squeezed into an eight-by-eight space in the front of the Belmar bar in Binghamton.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another all-original CD I liked, from another band that I picked up on in '09, 
is <i>Backhills</i> by the band Panhandle.  "Country Music for People who 
Don't Like Country Music", and that's me.  
The first time I heard this band, I called it "way too stereotypical country for me" 
and chitchatted until the next band took the stage.  
Then I actually listened to them at West Fest 7 and liked several 
of their songs.  So I tried this CD (their first) and it grew on 
me as I played it more.  The first impression I had of most songs was 
"they wrote eight or twelve bars of good music, and cycled through it a couple dozen times."  
Oh well, they're tight performances, and they end up being catchy stuff.  
"Our Ways" is a great song that could easily be taken by a 
hardcore punk band or a bluegrass outfit or a groove band or a 
ska band and used as an anthem: "Let us live this day / Let us live, let us live our ways!", 
c'mon, who won't get up for that?  
"Coming Down", about the consequences of partying too hard, is perhaps 
my favorite Panhandle original, but it's not on this album.  
"Maple Grove" is a traditional-style haunted-place-story-telling song: 
"No one knew that man that night or what he was out for, but he left 
that town bloody and he left them girls sore..."  
And you've got to love a band with a song titled "Field Car".  
They're from Oxford NY, which (like Spencer where I've been for twelve years) 
saw its best days in the nineteenth century.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My next pick is another CD from a type of music that doesn't usually 
move me: plain old singer-songwriter folk music.  <i>Fame by Frame</i> is 
the first album attributed to "Nate and Kate", but Nate Marshall and 
wife Kate have indie releases separately or with others.  
(See nateandkatemusic dot com, or  their MySpace page as slash nateandkatemusic.)  
Usually just an acoustic guitar (Nate) and cello (Kate) live, with other 
instruments swapped in such as harmonica, resonator guitar, mandolin, 
tambourine, or whatever, but various friends collaborated on various 
instruments for the CD.  My favorite here is "Freight Train Play that Chord"; 
I've been a sucker for train songs since I was about four years old.  
Nate and Kate provided my most interesting musical experience of the 
year when they played “Four Ball Blues” at West Fest.  The four balls of 
the title are blue juggling balls, which Nate kept aloft between (and sometimes during) 
verses of a good old rolling harmonica blues number.  It's not on the album 
because audio wouldn't capture the feel, but it worked well on WSKG-TV's live show 
"Expressions".  Of course my mother liked the televised part 
where Nate tossed Kate a ball, she caught it and played with it a moment, 
and she tossed it back timed to fit back into Nate's cycle.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's one more local album I want to call out as one of my real favorites of 2009.  
It's <i>Working the Soil</i> by the band Dirt Farm (dirtfarm dot org).  
2 electric and/or acoustic guitars (and/or other string implements like mandolin and dobro), 
standup bass, rock drumkit.  Redneck rock, bluegrass, Irish, even ballads.  
Spirited, often funny.  All twelve are originals, most by brothers Jeff or Rob 
Stachyra except one song by the bassman Scott Harrington, 
one song written by an old buddy, and one song written by drummer 
Larry Ricciardi's old band long ago.  
"Biofuel" has been used in ads for Willie Nelson's biodiesel enterprise.  
"Larry's Chili" is made special by something I won't say here (but it barks).  
"Celtic Mud" is one of the finest Irish-flavored instrumentals that I've ever heard.  
"Granny Hit the Jug" tells the <i>Beverly Hillbillies</i> story, 
from a sound clip of Granny's "Would you like a nice dirt farmer?" 
to “rheumatism medicine” to "Jethro and Hathaway gettin' it on".  
Steve DiRiancho from The String Band adds a fine banjo lead on this song.  
Also guesting from The String Band is Carol Simek, who adds excellent 
fiddle to four of these tunes.  A few other friends also sat in to help enhance various songs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was able to attend a lot of good music festivals in 2009.  
Trying to pick a "best", downtown Binghamton's annual Blues on the Bridge 
contends for the award on sheer volume.  
There were close to thirty bands' sets squeezed into one day 
(some years it's been a two-day show).  I heard all but a couple of the bands.  
Headlining was the only national act I saw all year: the Billy Hector Band, 
same as this event the previous year.  
They put out a lot of rock, flavored by blues and funk, for a three-piece.  
I really like their song "Buck Naked" which was on a CD released a few years back.  
One or two of the other bands came a couple hundred miles, the rest were 
from the surrounding counties.  
Lots of different sounds on a sunny end-of-summer day, mostly in genres strongly 
influenced by historical blues.  The big stage was split into two setups so one band's 
gear could be torn down and another's could be rigged and checked while the 
band in-between played.  This reduced turnaround downtime.  
More full bands got fit into a one-day schedule, but the solo and duo acoustic 
musicians mostly got squeezed out by the two-stage arrangement; in recent years 
they've played short sets during turnarounds.  Local favorites the Parlor Cats 
played two or three fairly small sets, sort of like a featured longer spot.  
I thought the Terry Walker Project gave a strong performance in the evening, horns 
and guitars and keyboards, a big enough and skilled enough group to handle 
blues, funk, jazz, rock, and more with feeling and precision every time I've heard them.  
Badweather Blues and Randy McStine and some others I've mentioned in past years 
gave good shows.  Most of the few bands that were new to me proved satisfying.  
The other bands I'd heard before all did at least okay, although mayor 
Matt Ryan played "Stormy Monday" again.  
And I didn't need to hear three versions of  "Loverboy" from different bands, 
nor three "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl" 's, no matter how good the songs are.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My other contender for "best festival of 2009", prioritizing quality over quantity, 
was West Fest 7, two days out in the lot behind Cyber Cafe West in Binghamton.  
Most sets were around an hour, rather than thirty to forty minutes like the Bridge, 
so each band got to stretch out a little more, find a groove, bring the crowd into it.  
You get a little more feel for a band's breadth, rather than just a 
few standards or the last eight songs they wrote which might all sound the same.  
When you can buy wondrous microbrew beers and ales inside, sit on the back porch 
with a friend, return the glass, and go kick hackysack to original jazz 
electric piano, life seems good for a weekend, no matter how inevitable Monday might be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although I didn't travel to big-time festivals even in New York State, 
I still heard a lot of good musical events such as fundraisers and fairs.  
The "Sam Jam for Diabetes" was organized by a diabetic friend of mine, 
to raise awareness and to support research.  
It turned into a big party at the Country Pines in Union Center, north of Endicott, 
with about a dozen bands and hundreds of people there most of the day.  
Great music.  The multi-band Zooney Fest benefit in summer was fun.  
Labor Day brought the Johnson City Field Days.  The last weekend of August 
had music for the first time at the Chris Thater Memorial, a cycling race 
in the streets of Binghamton.  
It's not quite as star-studded as the first Thater, which paid appearance money to 
world-class riders to get the event on the map, but there still were a 
lot of good teams including one which lined up, charged forward on the last lap, 
and with drafting pulled their sprinter up where he won in the last quarter-lap.  
The Blues on the Bridge organizers put on the Thater's music with about 
three bands each day, generally providing a good show, but there wasn't much 
crossover between the music crowd (small) and the cyclists and runners 
(lots of locals had run or ridden in supporting events before the main event).  
A church in the hamlet of Maine had its annual big-tent event with several bands.  
Like the previous year, I had a lot of fun at 
The String Band's portion of that event, not the least deterred by the heavy rains.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One "special event" deserves a place on my best-of-2009 list.  
The last couple of summers, the "Cooperstown Blues Express" has run Friday- 
and Saturday-evening party trains on a nineteenth-century rail line 
(the Cooperstown &amp; Charlotte Valley Railroad, restored by the 
Leatherstocking Railway Historical Society) from Milford NY to Cooperstown and back, 
with a blues band playing in an open (weather permitting) gondola car.  
Different band each time; I don't think their '09 schedule showed anyone 
playing more than two or three dates.  
I went one summer evening because it sounded like a fun way to hear my 
friends the Parlor Cats (theparlorcats dot com).  
Classic harmonica-and-electric-guitar Chicago blues, and originals that stand 
with the best old stuff.  
Well, yeah, that stuff works fine on a slow train, because that's 
where a lot of it was composed in the first place.  
The captive audience doesn't mind five-dollar drinks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I want to say good words about the other people who helped me enjoy so 
much live music last year.  
Cyber Cafe West remained my most-visited venue, maybe fifteen shows.  
The Hideout, on the edge of Binghamton, opened for "blues, brews, and barbecues", 
and it's my favorite new venue.  
I also had a bunch of excellent evenings including excellent meals at Dino's in Conklin.  
Besides Panhandle and Nate &amp; Kate, some of the best musicians I first heard 
in 2009 were Dr. E.F. and the Rudimentals of Sound (usually about six people, 
all originals that sound like they might be B-sides I didn't know by 
Phish or somebody); Hypnotic Clambake (veterans of the infamous Rooney Fest 
where most people got wasteder and muddier than they ever had in their lives), 
which has at times over decades been a klezmer band, a groove band, and things 
too strange for classification; and JimmyJohn McCabe (solo guitar/vocal originals).  
Some bands that I reconnected with, or just kept on following, included 
The String Band, who I heard most: at least ten bar shows and at least 
three festival sets; the other groups mentioned earlier in this article; 
String of Pearls (four-piece electric blues, I admire Doc's guitar work); 
Bohemian Sunrise (from Philly/Jersey, rock/funk/jazz/Caribbean/etc, my 
"Collaboration of the Year" for 2008 with three guys from the Terry Walker Project, 
BoSu brought a couple of friends from home to play fiddle and clarinet and 
didgeridoo on their '09 visits); Hooch (three old guys playing classic rock, 
they'd play more old blues if bar owners would hire them for that); 
Half Baked (with a description like Hooch's); Monkeys Typing (house band of the 
Cyber Cafe West, mostly Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan and a couple of 
Steve Strauss originals); Hi-Way Fruit Market (five-piece rock and blues, 
mainstream, fun); and GoGone (original rock).  
All these people, and a bunch more who I heard once somewhere sometime in 2009, 
busted hump to carry heavy gear around, and made music even when the crowd was 
talking or when there was no crowd but me, and did it for less than their gas 
and beer costs, and got up the next day when they needed hours more sleep.  
All so they and I could share music and feel good.  What a deal.  
The only thing I'll change for 2010: in August I'll attend the Grey Fox 
Bluegrass Festival, just north of the eastern end of Catskill State Park.  
About forty string bands, from legends like Del McCoury to up-and-comers 
like the Steel Drivers.  
Hundreds of other string bands around campfires in the campground all night.  
I might never come back.

<i>((Thanks, Mike, let me chime in with my own musical comments of more recent vintage.
The Ossipee Valley Music Festival is held every year at the end of July, one town over from
the town where my lake camp is in Maine.
They hold the New England Flatpicking, Banjo, and Songwriting Championships there and
it has a reputation as a really cool festival.... but I never made it there, until
this year.  
And boy, was I missing a lot!!
This year, I went for the day on Saturday (it's a four day festival with
all the usual camping and such if anyone is moved to come next year)
with my brother-in-law Bill (who is a quite mean picker himself)
and we left the women back at the camp swimming.
It worked out well for everyone.
Bill knows way more about banjos, guitars, dobros etc. than I do, so he's 
great to go to a concert with.
The atmosphere at Ossipee Valley was laid back and they had a great little "Stage Too!"
where we spent almost the entire day.
The main stage had a whole host of people with their chairs set up, but on Saturday 
afternoon most all of them where empty.
People were just wandering all about.
We saw a bit of the Packway Handle band from Athens there on the main stage, and they were OK,
but the acts we saw on Stage Too! were more fun and we got to sit only ten feet from 
the stage.
We also stopped by part of the Flatpicking Championships, and disappointingly almost
all of the competitors were kids with almost zero stage presence or personality.
There was one guy who seemed to be a teacher and brought his "star student",
but seven minutes (the requisite time) listening to someone noodle around really
just was not that interesting.
I'd rather listen to people with some years and some calluses on them who might
not have the lightning quick chops, but they understand that all of the magic
in music is in "the spaces", the spaces between notes and around notes and between
harmonies.
So what did I see that really grabbed me.
Just walking around the grounds, lots of people hung out just playing in small groups around
tent sites all over the place.
There was music everywhere!
Bill has been taking lessons on and off from Bobby St. Pierre, who I know from
his recorded work as part of North Star.
Bits and Pieces is one of those "well of course they are" band names formed
from some of what is left of North Star, including Bobby, and various other 
bands and people put together.
Lead vocalist Ted DeMille had huge amounts of personality and I really liked 
Dan Burke's understated dobro playing.  
I've played around with the dobro in the past, and one of those someday 
retirement projects for me would be sitting around and playing dobro, such
a brilliant "space" instrument!
Bobby hardly moves on stage, but especially his mandolin playing and compositions
really wowed me, not run-of-the-mill stuff, but plaintive cries with the instruments,
and just messing around having fun with music, the best thing about these festivals.
We talked to Bobby some afterward, he makes instruments, works way too much in 
machine work, and needs to take better care of himself.
He's a soft-spoken guy, but his finger picking speaks incredibly loudly.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Another band I saw on that stage was Wide Open Spaces and wow were they 
wide open.  I'd never heard of them before, and they certainly all had done
a lot of things before, but songwriter and mandolin/fiddle player Pete Anick
had a really droll sense of humor and impish stage presence.  They had two
leads, Mud Demers seemed to be known to lots of the audience from some of 
her other incarnations and she had a clear gorgeous voice while Matt Carlen
was more of the guy who comes in and flips all the tables over partly intentionally
and partly by accident.  With Pete Anick also joining in, they could do anything
from surfer harmonies, to bluegrass, to something almost reggae.
They did almost anything you could think of, quiet, loud, up tempo, adagio,
and even what my granddaughter Emily calls "crab", which is faster than 
presto (I'm not sure why).
I don't think they have anything out recorded, they are from Worcester way,
I think, but they sounded like something might come out soon.
They sort of reminded me in a weird way of Human Sexual Response,
the great old 1980's Boston punk band, more for the way the band
interacted with each other.
No one would call them a "pretty band" but they were more fun than
they looked.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And then the surprise highlight for me, since I really didn't plan
in advance to go to this, I just went, so I didn't know what bands 
were going to be there.
Back in August of 2008, I heard a band on the NPR program out of Boston,
"On Point".  
Host Tom Ashbrook does a great job of knocking me over occasionally with 
his music shows and this one really did it for me.
But I never really followed up on it.
Crooked Still is one of those hodge podge assemblies that you think can't 
quite possibly work the way it seems.
They have cello and fiddle and a fascinating and hard to describe sound.
Yes, its anchored from Appalachian roots, but it doesn't sound like it's
from there, and sounds fresh and alive.
And Crooked Still were doing this Stage Too! show as a build up to a late 
night show on the main stage later (which we didn't stay for).
So here we were, sitting ten feet from the stage listening to Wide Open
Spaces, and I asked Bill, "who's next over here", and he said, "Crooked
Still" and I said, hmmm sounds familiar.  Even as they came out, I wasn't
sure since I'd only heard them on radio, so I didn't recognize faces.
And then they started playing and singing and we were wowed.
Very quickly the crowd gathered from all over the festival grounds, but we 
had great second row seats already!
After this show, I need to go get some of the recordings.
Lead vocalist Aoife O'Donovan of course has a gorgeous voice, but she's 
also just such a down-to-earth freshfaced sweetheart.
Like all good band fiddlers, Brittany Haas is sort of shy and the quieter
one in the group, but a beautiful winding style that seamlessly went into
each song.  She and cellist Tristan Clarridge traded leads in such
incredible ways that they fooled the ears, you weren't sure sometimes
which was playing which notes - and that's not from someone who
doesn't know how to listen to string music.
One of the highlights, that I also remember very clearly from the 
NPR On Point show, was a hauntingly beautiful sing along song 
"Wind and Rain".
Unlike most singalong songs it is NOT a big anthem, and it's stunning
how well it works live.
The sing along parts are just the repetitive chorus parts
"Oh, the wind and rain" and "Cryin', oh the dreadful wind and rain".
This song I believe was originally written by Gillian Welch and David
Rawlins, but I've heard their version too and Crooked Still's version
is just SO much better. 
Anyway, I may say more about them after I go out and get some of the CDs.
Really tremendous show and we didn't even stay for that night's main show.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((So anyway, the organizers of this event had lots more women playing than
you sometimes see (kudos to them, it seemed like every band we saw had
at least one female member!) and just a real simple downhome feel
to the whole event. 
The Ossipee Valley Fairgrounds are a perfect location, the Banjo/Flatpicking
contests were held in the cattle ring, sort of fitting?
Stage Too! had a tent over the AUDIENCE, so you could go sit in the sun
in front of the main stage if you wanted, but you also could sit in shade
at the other stage. 
That's for me, I'm afraid, the weather was really hot and really sunny and
we were so comfortable sitting there!
And there were loads of people around, but so much going on, all at the 
same time, that you could get close to anything you were looking at.
Be inside, outside, whatever.
I had an absolutely wonderful time and I'm definitely going back next year,
possibly bringing more people (any takers?).
I know I can attract Charlotte back with the idea of a Stage Too! that is 
under a tent, she REALLY isn't, and I'm not either that excited about 
prospects of sitting out under a hot sun all day for a musical concert.
I know some people love it, and I do like being outside, but not baking
in the sun.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I decided to hold up this game, since I don't have all the orders and 
Breaking Away isn't fun if everyone is just playing lowest card.
I'll let you all know who I need orders from and we should keep going
next issue.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b>
I know some of you around the US are baking this summer, but it has been a gorgeous 
summer for the most part in New England, the first in many, many years.
It's now when I really appreciate having a Maine lake camp.
Be well everyone!
