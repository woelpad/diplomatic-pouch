I will take a few of you and ask you off at this point, especially the ones
who are hanging around as ex-players that I should have dropped long ago.

I hope that's clear and ask questions if it isn't.

On the GOOD side, I helped Doug Kent get one issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i> out,
and we are well on the way to a dynamite second one, so I think we will reach
the century mark very shortly.
I helped do the testing so that we move to the next step so 
the new Diplomacy National World Cup is recruiting players, interested?
See below.
And, I've been having fun actually playing Dip again.
So I have been busy, just the szine hasn't gotten to the top of the list.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

I also have taken over the Postal port/DipPouch/Postal

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games.
And Andy York has been my most frequent subszine guest lately!!!
He's been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And so has Doug Kent, so we have a full stable of subszines.
And Michael Lowrey gets his in every few issues too!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

As I should have known, Jeff Key knew how to find Eric Just, so
Jeff wins the fifty dollar prize.
Jeff, anything you want to do with that that I can help you with?
Or you can follow Edi's lead and donate to my travel fund, 
which NO ONE has claimed yet!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

We're running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
late.
Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number, scores are in parentheses) 
is, in alphabetical order, 
Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper (1), Dick Martin, Richard Smith (3), Joakim Spangberg, and Brad Wilson (4).
The linking theme thing didn't seem to go over too well.
No one really figured out the true linking theme.  
Rick Desper was using Underground tube stops and songs with that as the title,
they were things like that.  
I'll let you guys talk a bit to each other on that with your guesses.
I have added some kind of comment on each tune.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: two more tunes (seven if you're joining up new, four if you NTRed (NO TUNES
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gentlemen (well, in theory anyway),

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sorry for the delay.  I have acquired new gainful employment, which
has
necessitated my being gone for 2 of the first 3 weeks of it, with a
repeat
in the next 3 weeks.  Someplace fun?  Uh, no.  West Point, MS, if you
want
to look it up (took me 10 hours to get home today).  I did get to stay
at
a condo at the Old Waverly Golf Course, where the Women's US Open was
played in '98.  Had I actually been there when the sun was up I'd
probably
have told you it was pretty.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On to more important matters, even if it's too late for the current
<i>TAP</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First off, let's just agree that every team has a flaw.  More and
more, as
with the NFL, it's just better to pick the teams that have the most
going
for them and ignore the warts.  Ok, maybe it isn't, but that's what
I'm
going with.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  Rick, consider yourself laughed at for your deluded
optimism,
just not as hard as you might think.  It looks to me like the balance
of
power has shifted dramatically to this division for the league, and
the AL
is the better league.  I think it's Yankees, Red Sox, Orioles, Blue
Jays,
Devil Rays, and the Blue Jays might be .500.  Boston gets the WC with
96
wins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  This division is either really good or really mediocre.
Detroit's young arms won't bounce back this year...count on it.
They'll
be good, but it's a 4-team race, and all 4 might be in the 81-88 win
range. But I'll pick Indians, Tigers, White Sox, Twins, Royals.  White
Sox
go 81-81, 7 games back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  I think the Angles and A's took a big dive.  Rangers,
Angels,
A's, Mariners, and the Angels don't make .500.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Once again, the balance has shifted here, but not quite as
much
as in the AL.  As Atlanta did NOT win the division last year I am no
longer contractually obligated to pick them to win it this year.
However,
I still think they're pretty good, and good enough for the WC.  Mets,
Braves, Phillies, Marlins, Nats.  Phillies win 85 games, Marlins 79.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  This division got worse on paper and in reality, but the
Cards will have a better record than last year, which means little.
Cards, Cubs, Astros, Reds, Brewers, Pirates.  Cubs go 76-86, 11 games
back.  Anyone found picking the Brewers for this division will be drug
tested.  Ain't happening.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Toughest call here.  First, let me predict that Barry Bonds
will
cause a controversy sometime this season.  Then I'll say Diamondbacks,
Dodgers, Giants, Padres, Rockies.  Giants might be within 5 games.
Arizona goes 88-74.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Sox over Rangers

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees over Indians

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets over Cards

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Braves over Diamondbacks

<div class="p"><!----></div>
LCS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees over Red Sox

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets over Braves

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets over Yankees

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Better read that again.
I've been working on an email on a lot of topics, some baseball
related,
for about 4 months now.  I'll try and get it out in time for the next
<i>TAP</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As promised, here's my take on life, liberty, and the pursuit of sports.
This email is likely to be written in several shifts and will probably
seem a bit disorganized and disconnected.  Try to read it and NOT think
of the name, "Scott Morris".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic #1:  Ok, I've been a little slow to respond to something that you
mentioned last October.  Maybe I'll use that to start with this analogy:
there's a bigger penalty for driving without a driver's license than
there is for driving over the speed limit.  This is probably because
it's a lot harder to catch someone driving without a legal right than
there is to catch someone speeding.  So it is with baseball and their
penalties (bet you wondered where THIS was going).  For things that the
umps OUGHT to be able to catch you at, like having pine tar on your
hand, or Vaseline in your glove, there isn't the penalty that there is
for steroids, which is a lot harder to catch at game time.  I think this
is correct.  Same too with Hall of Fame induction.  Yeah, we've got more
than a few pitchers that have, shall we say, gotten around the rules as
written DURING the game and haven't gotten caught and yet still have a
bust in Cooperstown.  But it's the times where you CAN'T catch them that
concerns me, and apparently concerns MLB as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This does not mean that MLB hasn't been complicit in their approach to
chemical cheating over the years.  But the union is going to have to
cave in on testing for steroids, HGH, illegal supplements and
subscriptions to TAP (mind-altering...and nearly impossible to detect in
the dugout) if I want to be able to tell my kid "don't do this, it won't
get you anywhere" with a straight face.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic Shift:  Speaking of Hall of Fame, it's a shame that the whole
steroid cloud took away from the election of Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripkin,
Jr., and that McGwire got more publicity than both of them combined.
Both guys had, obviously, great careers, and I think that Gwynn's will
be looked at as even greater as the years go by.  It's actually a curse
to be just a West Coast player during your career, as you won't ever get
a fair shake by the national media.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic shift:  Hugo Chavez has proclaimed a "21st century Socialist
Revolution" in Venezuela.  I predict that they will have an oil shortage
there by 2012.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic shift:  There are times when you look at your TV and remember why
you became a sports' fan.  Sometimes these times take mere seconds, such
as when Argentina scored against Mexico in last year's World Cup on a
great cross-field pass where the forward bounced the ball off his chest,
then left-footed it to the far upper corner without it hitting the
ground.  Sometimes these times last a couple of minutes.  The
Dodgers/Padres game last year where the Dodgers hit 4 straight homers to
tie it in the bottom of the 9th and then win in extra innings, or the
last 4 laps of the 2006 Indy 500, where the lead changed twice from an
Andretti to an Andretti to another damn Penske driver (side note:  think
of Andretti vs. Penske at Indy as Red Sox vs. Yankees...1 win for an
Andretti in 1969, 15 wins for Penske since, so Mario V is due in 2055).
Sometimes the times you're glad to be a sports' fan last the entire
event.  Such a time recently was the Fiesta Bowl the night of 1 January
2007 between Oklahoma and Boise St.  Throw away the Hollywood-style
ending, where the Boise St. running back takes the handoff on a
Statue-of-Liberty play to score the winning 2-point conversion in
overtime (43-42), then proposes to his cheerleader girlfriend on the
sideline.  This was a game where the little guy looked across the line
at the big guy for the whole game and didn't blink, and one that will
hopefully bring College Football to its senses and gives them a rational
playoff system where the deserving get a shot at the national title.  I
would have liked to have likened this to George Mason's run through the
2006 basketball tourney, but as we've seen that did nothing to get the
little guys into the 2007 basketball tourney.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic shift:  Having a 4-year-old son gives you a new perspective on
life.  I certainly watch less sports than I used to (although I see this
changing), and I have to learn to take children's television with a
grain of salt.  One of Nathan's favorites is "Thomas the Tank Engine"
which, if you've never seen it, is about a railway on a mythical Island
of Sodor, which has a distinct British accent.  Having watched dozens of
episodes I can conclude without fear of contradiction that the Island of
Sodor has no effective National Transportation Safety Board (phrase most
often heard on the show:  "luckily no one was hurt").

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic shift:  Nathan has hit the lottery.  We live in a new subdivision
on a street with 15 houses, 2 of which are not yet occupied.  Of the
remaining 13 houses there are a total of 27 kids including Nathan.  5 of
the other 26 are boys his age (plus one girl his age who is a twin of
one of the boys).  If all the fathers start now (and a referendum for a
new high school passes) we can probably have the starting lineup of St.
Charles West's high school's basketball team residing on the block in
2019.  Nathan will probably be the shooting guard, as he's not going to
be big enough to be inside and has little inclination to play defense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Topic shift:  Having written in to <i>TAP</i> for 10 years now I felt it time
to re-evaluate where I stand on things that I write, since for some
reason you actually feel them important enough to print.  So I thought
about the whole concept of "team sports".  I don't get enough time to
memorize the entire rosters of too many teams any more, as some of the
things that I have acquired in the last 10 years include a wife, son and
mortgage.  So I get down on team sports because the faces change too
often.  Nonetheless, I found myself coming up with a list of the top 5
teams that I actually root for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#1:  Chicago Cubs.  Fan since 1967.  Last WS title 1908.  Last NL title
1945.  And they won't win another one any time soon.  Piniella can
infuse new life into them to make a run at the NL Central, which is
awful, but realistically they're 2 pitchers, 2 infielders and an
outfielder from being a legitimate threat.  But I have hopes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#2:  Chicago Blackhawks.  Fan since 1967.  Last title 1960.  No chance
for one any time soon, as the owner won't put any money into them (you
can't even see the home games on TV).  They actually gave me a little
hope for their first playoff spot in 10 years until they lost 10 in a
row in December though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#3:  University of Illinois football.  Fan since 1976.  Last Big 10
title, 2001, before that 1984.  This is how it should be.  They win
titles about as often as the statistics say they should.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#4:  Indianapolis Colts.  Fan since 1984.  Last title, February 2007.
This item would have come off better had I written the note before the
playoffs started, as I'd planned.  But they were fun to watch, even
though I'm not in Indy any more.  It also shows that small markets can
win in the NFL, and they really don't have to be managed all that well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#5:  Jack Roush Racing.  Fan since 1993.  Titles in 2003 &amp; 2004.  Ok,
it's tough to root for a NASCAR team that doesn't go back to the 50s.
But Jack Roush is a pretty cool guy, and is one of the best "hands-on"
owners in sports.  The only downside is that this year he merged with
John Henry and the other owners of the Boston Red Sox to become
"Roush-Fenway Racing", so he won't win another title until 2090.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of those five, the only one I really care about is the Cubs.  There is
something still charming about them.  Maybe it's the ballpark with the
Ivy and the Scoreboard.  Maybe it's the "loveable loser" concept.  Maybe
I'm just old.  But now even Nathan will make sure we're watching to sing
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in the 7th.  It makes baseball worthwhile
in April when it's cold, and August when they're out of contention.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One curious note is that White Sox fans (my wife, for example) often ask
me how bad I feel that their team won in 2005.  I really don't care that
they won in 2005.  The White Sox are NOT the Cubs' rivals.  The
Cardinals are.  So 2006 was a real bummer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With team sports just not being what it has been for me, I find myself
rooting for &amp; against individuals.  This is a lot easier in racing or
golf, as you get to see them interviewed a lot more often than other
athletes, so you get a handle on their personalities better than you can
when you only see A-Rod/Tom Brady/T-Mac/Sidney Crosby get 5 seconds on
Sportscenter.  In thinking on it, racers and golfers usually have an
incentive to be interviewed, as they're walking billboards.  Maybe
baseball players would be a little more fan-friendly if their contract
included wearing something they had to peddle.  Hmmm...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the last 48 hours I became a fan of one David Moss.  For those of you
who haven't heard of him (and that's ALL of you) he plays center on the
4th line of the Calgary Flames.  I have just started a new job, and Mr.
Moss is the nephew of one of my new coworkers.  As we've all been on
travel in the middle of nowhere (West Point, MS) for the last few weeks
we had a bonding session in one of our rooms with a few pizzas, some
beers, and Game 1 of the Calgary-Detroit series.  The Red Wings won 4-1,
and the highlight of the game was when the camera panned to David Moss
on the bench, then to his parents and brother in the stands, as my
coworker said, "That's my wife's brother in the ugly hat".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As I said above, I've acquired new gainful employment (as of 19 March),
trying to get armored vehicles to the military so they can send them
someplace.  I'm learning how to build trucks, and I'm teaching my
employers how to build military trucks.  I think that's all I'm allowed
to say about it other than it's pretty cool, it pays the bills pretty
well, and it has put me in West Point, MS for 4 of the last 5 weeks.
I'll probably have more time to write in to you as I'm spending a lot
less time pounding the pavement, even though I'm usually someplace I
can't get a wireless connection.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's probably a few things that I've forgotten here but it's taken me
a week to get this far, so I'll sign off so I can send this tonight, and
promise that I'll send things more often.  Really.  Would I lie to you?
Heck, I'll even support you into Rumania.

(STAR TREK PRESS, 7 OF 9'S LOG): 
"I'm confused!  Things are looking up for the beleaguered Federation.  
With the help of our Andorian and Ferengi allies we have conquered 
all 3 of the Cardassian home worlds, including Cardassia Prime, and 
we are in position to take space station Tarok Floore. 
Cardassia still controls Earth and Mars and that's where the 
confusing part comes in.  Gul Dukat in his infinite wisdom has moved 
his remaining forces away from Vulcan, our last Federation home world. 
Since we don't have to defend it we can concentrate on our Cardassian campaign 
and then we can start our plans to retake the Federation.  
I'm also worried about our Packlett allies.  Having conquered the Romulans 
with the help of the Ferengi they had the Romulans completely surrounded 
at their last deep space base.  Instead of finishing them off they withdrew 
and now are in no position to take the base.  No offense to idiot Federation 
morality but we are at war.   The only good Romulan is a dead Romulan. 
I have to ask myself whether the Packlett commander is the care bear 
of the century or if he has an ulterior motive in keeping the Romulan 
empire still afloat.  I'm suggesting that my Ferengi allies watch their back. 7 out".

(STAR TREK PRESS, CAPTAIN'S LOG): "I think I am going to go completely insane. 
WE HAD EM!  The Romulans were completely surrounded.  We attacked and the 
Romulans saw it coming.  They used a multiphasic shield to withdraw a 
troop transport then they used a Galaxy Class Bird of Prey to transport 
them to Andorian Deep Space 2.  Their attack destroyed an Andorian troop 
transport killing everyone on board.  The Romulans are now in position 
to do serious damage to Andorian forces.  To make matters worse our 
long range sensors have detected 2 Tomari star ships heading this way.  
We cannot allow the Romulans and the Tomarians to link up.    
We can still win this war, but we and our allies are running out of time,  
Kirk out."

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) And those of you who didn't have any lower card, played a three.....
everyone played lowest card, big surprise!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A SELF-DEFEATING PROPHESY): Next game, Rick will try
the first turn break, and Tom and Dave will both stop him.
