<br /><br />We continue with a NEW Kendo Nagasaki game, join ANY time, just send me a guess!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Doug has been winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.
My intent right now is to do that.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to do that, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock is now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.

<i>((For upcoming cons around the world: /Face/cons/index.php, 
but note that some of the Americans have stopped posting the tournaments there.
Shame, shame, shame... with the move of the diplom.org site, I hope this will be
reinvigorated.
So, since I will be running TempleCon again, February 6-8, 2015, here in Providence,
let's move on to that.
It's featured at the top of the Tournament Convention site above and coming up in
TWO short weeks.
There is an explosion of interest at the moment, so we have a shot at getting
three boards.  The more the merrier.
Please consider coming, I have two "pay-what-you-can" hotel rooms and the 
four round tournament is Friday 6PM, Saturday 9AM and 6PM, Sunday 11AM.
I think this year I'm finally going to get a bit of a breakout, so please join us.
Let me know NOW if you're planning to come!!!))</i>

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year, the finals are starting now.
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals 
are now starting, everyone has been queried.
But you also still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!
Word is we may cancel them, I think the finals should reignite interest.
We also are picking up some discussion for a successor Diplomacy World Cup.
I think we all realize that this interesting experiment has not been completely
successful.
I recently was elected to the Council for DWC IV, so if anyone has any 
ideas about where this idea should go to reinvigorate it, please let me know!

Hi, Jim.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are my picks for favorite local music of the year, if you're still doing that 
in <i>TAP</i> this year.  
These are from 44 days with live music: 47 solo/duo/group acts plus 37 repeats, 
where I heard at least half a set.  
Most of those days included at least a few original songs.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I haven't been, but I love to have your thoughts, maybe at least 
partly sparked by me talking music again.
I'm running behind again this month, so this is what we'll get, but
I'd love to hear other thoughts from others!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Area bar show: Digger Jones at the Rail House, Waverly NY, Mar. 15.  
Blues-rock, roots-rock, great originals and old old songs and groovy Dead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Area festival:  Susquehanna River Big Splash, at Marvin Park, Owego NY, May 24-25.  
Two stages so I heard parts of 16 bands, including Band of Strings' 
first show after a nine-month hiatus.  
Bands based on Donna the Buffalo and the Horseflies, 
and many local friends, made the whole weekend great fun.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
National act in the area:  Hot Tuna, with Donna the Buffalo, at State Theatre, 
Ithaca NY, Dec. 5.  After 45 years, Jorma Kaukonen and Neal Casady and 
friends still have spirit and skill.  Sometimes they play acoustic duo 
shows but this was their five-piece electric version, 
with over a dozen string instruments being played.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Recurring area bar gig:  Pete Ruttle and guests, at the Union Hotel, Binghamton NY.  
Highlights of my half-dozen evenings include Mar. 21 with Chris Merkley and 
Wren, and May 9 with Claire Byrne/Joe Kollar/Joey Arcuri playing all 
sorts of songs for many hours.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For private parties:  Dirt Farm, Jan. 11 and Jul. 26.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Favorite local songs: "Doing Hard Time", Band of Strings, written by 
Steve DeRiancho; "Before I Rust", Driftwood, written by Claire Byrne; 
"Lorraine", Woodshed Prophets, written by Ed Gliha.  
I think all three originals debuted in 2013, but I appreciated their 
heart and depth and spirit more as I heard them more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most total fun over the year:  Woodshed Prophets, eight shows including 
several at Kelly's in Endicott NY with lots of dancing.  
Rock, roadhouse country, blues, highlighted by Rob Stachyra's great 
Telecaster work.  Honorable mention to Driftwood, ranging from a thousand 
people at Big Splash to the tiny Oneonta Theatre and tinier front corner of the Union.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

stand by for regular Diplomacy.
I've pared down the standby list according to who I'm actually in touch with.
If I removed you and you want to be added back, just say so.
Otherwise,
just let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF given the new policies.

1) Moving on to 1902!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(VIENNA-ROME): This was probably the most satisfying Fall 1901 seasons I've 
ever had as Austria (almost as satisfying as sex). I kept you out the Capitol, 
denied Turkey Greece, obtained two builds for the Empire, and the 
Home Port is open for a build.  What is not to like? 
I presume the results were somewhat less satisfying for Her Grace? 
Is that why you needed to depart on a Caribbean cruise?  
No matter, I trust we will be reaching an accord upon your safe return, God speed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LIZARD KING to ALL): "The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. 
You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. 
You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. 
There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, 
on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS): As the victorious troops and sailors in the Iberian theater rest 
and recuperate, volunteers are flocking to recruiting stations across the nation.   
"Such a surge in patriotism reflects well upon our nation," 
stated Defense Minister Petard, "but we shall not yet require so many volunteers." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to WORLD): It's a sunshine day!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MARSEILLES): Celebrations in Marseilles became a bit rowdy when the wine 
ran out forcing many to drink beer and, god forbid, water for the first time.   
Desperate orders of more Burgundy were placed and hopes rested that the Nouveau 
Beaujolais would be ready for the holidays!  
The King, celebrating another year, stated: "Le vin, c'est moi."   
In other news, the local Betty Fordeaux clinic reported a number of regal 
visitors for a stay of "rest and recuperation."

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) So, the pack continues to lurch very slowly toward the finish line.
But this turn the pack reformed so that will change.  
Someone may finish in Turn 15 now, we'll see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRESS):
Roberto take a turn at the front as Team Froggy continue in racing formation.  
How soon before it all falls apart?
