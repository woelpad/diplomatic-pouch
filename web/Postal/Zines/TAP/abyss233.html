<p><br><p><br>A quick, slim issue this time around as all of the subszines appeared last time.
I decided to hold the remainder of the <i>Diplomacy World</i> discussion until
next issue to give some of those who received last issue late time to respond.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
But there are some other options.
Mark Kinney is trying to get his dipszine going again (one game is
already filled), but he may have other openings.
Mark is looking for standbys too.
Contact Mark NOW at 4820 Westmar Terrace #6, Louisville, KY  40222, (502) 412-3079;

I'm in the game and you CAN'T miss watching ME play....

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ???</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>The reward for resolving a certain mystery that currently exists
in our hobby is still open.
I won't be announcing another person to search for until Issue #235
while we allow time to search this mystery.
Feel free to assist Brenton Ver Ploeg or others to solve it.
I shall be saying nothing more about it.

<p>
Or spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
Does anyone know her name?
This could be a way toward finding Jerry.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>If you've had your head under a tree, the World's Largest Diplomacy Tournament
is currently underway by E-Mail, featuring over 550 players from all around the
world.
<i>TAP</i> readers who are participating are ENCOURAGED to write in commentaries
on games, or teams, or whatever.
You can see the commentary on the games by logging in as a guest at this

<p>
The second round is off to a fitful start.... but there is lots of commentary
from non-players.
The player negotiations are rumored to be quite intense.
For the <i>TAP</i> team players, Steve Emmert is Turkey in one game and not
benefiting from an Austrian collapse, while Jim O'Kelley is playing a 
masterful game as Germany against Toby Harris' France.
We are lookin' hopefully for a good outcome here.

Jim,
I recently bought the new Diplomacy CD-ROM but I kept if for just two
days before returning it. It was awful. The AI was terrible. The entire
package, in my estimation, was very disappointing. The suits at Hasbro,
in their infinite wisdom, have also decided to quit putting out the
board game? 
<i>((No, let's clear up that misconception now.
The new board game ALSO should be out there.
I've seen it.))</i>
Amazing. Just so I can have something, I bought a game at a
local hobby store last week. The board game isn't what it used to be but
I gave my old board to Kent Pollard so I had to replace it.
The old game went to a good cause.

<p>
 <p><br>Always a fun time out in the forest of the Elves.  Eric and Cathy are as 
close to real life elven royality as you are likely to meet this side of 
middle earth.  Although the middle earth parallel holds futher for the above 
diplomacy game.  Sauron Tallman rose strong from Mordor to darken the happy 
landscape of Verlot.  He clouded the vision of elves, hobbits, and Canadians, 
convincing them all that poor but honest Buz Eddy was a threat to all 
humanity. 

<p>
He played a superb Turkey.  He allied with Russia, (Eric),  played soft while 
pointing to the west where the alliance pattern was in a state of flux,  but 
threatened to resolve quickly when England (Mike Hall ((Canadian Navy man 
stationed in Victoria BC, and veteran of the Denver Armada this year)) ) lost 
Norway and found no friends.

<p>
Terry convinced Austria (Jonas Johnson) and Italy (newcomer Al Bouvier) that 
the western threat was real and that they MUST charge westward.  At the same 
time he  used the fact that Germany (Poor but honest Buz Eddy) deployed into 
the Baltic to prepare to form the western side of the stalemate line as a 
obvious viscious hostile attack on the Elven Prince's sacred forests.  The 
Elven Prince responded by moving everything he had north.  

<p>
Meanwhile France (Tom, off-the-wall, Howell, who earlier in the year arranged 
for Buz to be the quickest eliminated in a Sea of Dispair game) was cleaning 
out the British Isles, and since Germany was being invaded by the single 
remaining English unit, chased it down through Holland, and Kiel.  He 
successfully destroyed it, and took most of Germany's dots in the process.

<p>
In Spring 1906 FTR, and FT were proposed.  Poor, but honest, Buz declared 
that he would not now or ever vote for a draw that didn't include him.  
Sauron Tallman, broke into a broad evil smile,  I admire such tenacity, now I 
can watch Buz die! he cackled.  As the Fall turns were being written, Sauron 
enchanted the assembled with a dark mantra. ``Buz must die, Buz must die, Buz 
must die" echoed through the forest.

<p>
Poor but honest Buz, pleased the gamers by guessing wrong and dutifully 
dying. Now Sauron the Toadfather surveyed the toadies before him, annointed 
Tom Howell as chief Toadie and proposed an TF to which all remaining happily 
agreed.

<p>
Buz also maintains that he was poisoned, as Mike Hall brought down some 
pretty damn good Canadian beer which is 5% stuff and dulled Buz's thinking 
and slurred his speech.  Eric and Cathy were wonderful hosts.  Buz had to 
leave, but there was more gaming being set-up as he left.   Eric says we need 
another DeadwoodCon in October.  Mike &amp; Buz are booked for World DipCon.  I 
hope everyone one will come to Dragonflight August 25 - 27 in Seattle.

<p>
Of course, this being a DeadwoodCon the traditional territory had to be 
revisited, albeit sadly without Joan Exstrom and Ken Corbin present.  The 
Hobby  sex Ghod's fertile toe was once again mentioned, and then the visit of 
Joan and kids to Brux this year was mentioned, and Mike Hall asked who's 
Brux.  Eric deftly changed the subject before the Toadfather's blood pressure 
exceeded 400/395.  Mike Hall asked Terry if he was going to WDC in Baltimore, 
Terry said no,  the only time he went out of the northwest for Dip was to Bob 
Olson's houseCon (Kansas?)  (late 1980?), and Eric said that was a good time. 
I asked Jonas Johnson which zines (this is spelled properly with NO ``s" at 
the beginning) 
<i>((You're lucky I'm even printing this.....))</i>
he played in and he name his current ones, plus <i>Been There, 
Done That</i> which was Tom Nash's magnificent construction, and ready made 
burn-out of the the early 1990's.  
<i>((Tom is now living in the Big Apple and should still be reading this....))</i>

<p>
I had a great time, of course, I lost everything I tried including a nerfball 
catching contest with Eric's daughter,  and  ShebaDog (now age 14)  won the 
getting sick even though I was pulling down the Canadian brew.

Hi old people (Kuddles and the Wimp);

<p>
Just a short note begging you guys not to confuse poor Buz.  As he grows older 
his assorted handicaps (mental, physical and social) drag him deeper into a 
fantasy world where he is convinced that:
    
<p>
a.  He could beat a delivery room full of newborns at dip.
    
<p>
b.  His writing is (pick any or all);

<p>
 Literate
            
<p>
 Humorous
            
<p>
 Interesting
            
<p>
 Printable

<p>
c.  Anyone has anything nice to say about him.

<p>
<i>((Yeah, let's let him down easy!))</i>

<p>
They don't let him out of the silly old dipsters home that often but they do 
pay us big bucks to look after him for the day.  We all wonder if it is worth 
it but as long as the checks don't bounce we will take him out and let him 
rant and rave over a dip board once or twice a year.

<p>
He is still able to feed himself and open beer cans unassisted but rumor has 
it that if senility gets much worse he will have to give up his tax business 
and just go to work for the IRS where no one will notice.

<p>
Hope this finds you well and up to your hip-waders in grandkids...

The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll either find a commercial service or perhaps buy some new
equipment to get the copying done.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.

Next up we have a slightly dated announcement from Hank Alme, but
I thought it was worth putting in here for human interest.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Hank Alme (Sat, 13 May 2000 18:13:21 -0600 (MDT))</b>

<p>
Jim:
I have been kicked out of my house by the fire in Los Alamos. So far, my
house is in no danger (I live in White Rock). We do not know when we will
be allowed back, but it will probably not be until next week some time. 

<p>
I do not have 'net access in Santa Fe (I am using a terminal at the red
cross shelter in Santa Fe right now, but I am staying elsewhere).

<p>
If you could help tell the guys in Fletcher Christian and in Mark Kinney's
game, I would be much obliged. I will be able to check messages once in a
while, but not often.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Thanks, Hank, almehj of swcp.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((A week later came this postscript....))</i>

<p>
The whole thing has been very interesting. It is more excitement than I
need. We got back earlier than anyone here expected. We stayed one night
at my brother's duplex in Santa Fe, and then moved to a hotel for a
while. The local hotels relaxed their ``no pets" policies for evacuees,
thank goodness. We were running around with a dog (labrador/rotweiller
mix) and two cats.

<p>
The only sort of fire related thing in our house was the stench of
rotting garbage that greeted us upon our return. It took a day to air
out the house. Next time I get an evacuation order at 2:00 AM, I'll
remember to take out the trash.

<p>
The word is that we will be going back to work at Los Alamos National
Lab this Tuesday. Manager types will be in there tomorrow. Two weeks
vacation, under these circumstances anyway, is more than I want...

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has stepped out of the sixth spot,
so we now need THREE more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've forgotten just this instant
who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p>
(GERMANY W '02): Build A Par 

<p>
(BOOB to GERMANY): Right....

<p>
(RUSSIA): Russia builds army St. Petersburg for a Flying Dutchman, hoping this will
cause the Turkey ... errrrrrrrrrr ... Turkish Sulking ... errrrrrrr ...
Sultan ... to mess his tunic.

<p>
(TUR to RUS): Too late! I now have more than just ``one landlocked fleet"!
Wishful thinking, my friend, about an A-I alliance. I just don't think
it's in the cards.

<p>
(VANCOUVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, A SUBURB OF MOSCOW):  Mealy Mouth Larvae and
Lacewing Droppings Press.  The Russian Tzar was roaming around Vancouver
International Airport, trying to seize up a plan for international terrorism
there when he spotted the foul smelling, cigar smoking, pot-bellied Prime
Minister, who was waiting to way-lay Buddy [that's the type of guy he is,
huh!].  The Tzar dashed behind the oyster bar and waited and watched ... and
waited and watched.  Wouldn't you know it, there was Buddy, walking briskly
towards the Prime Minister, lugging suitcases like a pack-horse might do.
The two [no, not the horse and the Prime Minister] sat on a rather long
bench and chatted, and spoke, and even talked, to and around one another.
The Primie seemed to change the subject so much that Buddy began frothing at
the mouth.  A hour rolled by, and Buddy's plane loaded, and left the ramp
without him.  Once more, the Primie left Buddy hanging in the lurch.  The
Tzar took out his gat and silencer [that would be his wife], and took a bead
on the Prime Minister. A silent shot was not heard ringing out across the
chasm of the airport.  The Prime Minister faltered [no, he was not shot ...
he always falters].  Airport Police, on their bicycles no less, raced
towards the Tzar.  The Tzar quickly whipped out [no, not that, Shrevey] his
Persona non Grata papers, smiled in his usually weird manner, and boarded
his private plane, never more to be seen in Canada ... not alive, anyway.
Primie, shaken no less [no, not that kind of shaken, Shrevey!], headed for
the men's room to clean his pants.  He heard a voice from the past, his
mother's voice, saying, ``Primie, you wash you mouth out with soap!  Ya
hear?"  With that said and done, Shrevey sniffed once again at his
lutefisk-haggis stew, and decided a cold Mythos was better.  He then took
the potatoes out of the stew pot and dumped in four bottles of Mythos, got
out two straws, and said, ``This is the last straw!", and threw the straw
box into the dust bin.

<p>
(TUR to FRA): Good luck. O'Donnell certainly left you a mess...

<p>
(TZAR BUDDY to SULTAN RANDLYLESSNESS):  Lutefisk and Haggis Stew Press.  The
Sultan was busy, practicing trying to get egg from his face.  He peered out
the window that was a large door, and saw his peer, the Tzar, racing his
white stallion down the slopes of a nearby Turkish mountainside.  The Sultan
raced into the closet from whence he just emerged, and let out a scream that
could be heard all the way to the outside of the closet door.  when he
discovered that he had stuffed his crying towel into his mouth, he removed
the towel and screamed once more, splattering spit all over the inside of
the closet door.  Feeling a little wet, he noticed that he had gone into the
wrong closet ... he was in the water closet.  He said, ``Oh, well, I needed
this anyway!"  The rumble of a toilet paper roll was soon muffled by the
sound of flushing water.  A loud burp was then heard all the way down the
hallway.  The Sultan reached for more paper.  Actually, the burp was caused
by the mixture of lutefisk, haggis, and Mythos beer.

<p>
(TUR to AUS): Let's get 'em. Can't let E-G totally dominate this game.

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY):  Sorry to talk so far over your head.  Let me simplify
things a bit.  Turkey is going down.  Got it?

<p>
(OTTOMAN PEOPLE'S PRESS):
The Turkish 1st division, fighting infidels bravely in the Ukraine,
has went on to greater glory beyond the physical realm. The unit was
assailed by heretics from Russia and though they fought bravely to the
last man, the division was ultimately destroyed 20 kilometers south and
west of Kiev. A new division has been recruited in Anatolia to replace
the martyrs. Sultan El Ahbid Ellis promised that ``The Russians will pay
for this outrage many times" and he pledged aid to his ally to the West,
Archduke Franz Daniel Gorham. The Turkish navy has recently doubled in
size and a flotilla is said to be ready to sail West to bring much
needed stability to the chaos surrounding the Ionian Sea.

Thanks to Art Schleinkofer for being available, though not needed.

2) We are testing a new map, courtesy of Harold Reynolds, this issue.
Ordinarily I don't publish a map with Winter, but I wanted to test this
as an extra.
Please let me know which map you would prefer.
The original of this map is in color and includes shaded home center 
provinces.
In black and white, these shadings are visible to one extent or another
on the maps.
Rather than take these shadings out, I decided to leave them since they
may be helpful for home center comparisons by these powers.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note John Schultz's new phone number and Chris Trent's new address.
Chris, is your phone number still the same???

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TSAR KRISTOF - SULTAN ALI-SCOTT): I apologize for the southward movements
but I really have to keep an eye on those ``fishing fleets'' in the Baltic.

<p>
(TSAR KRISTOF - KING JAMES OF ENGLAND): Per our communique, the fleet movements 
through Norway are not of hostile design.
Also, when you say ``bangers and mash'' you kinda sound funny.

<p>
(TSAR KRISTOF - KING JOHN OF ITALY): Wait a minute.... aren't you in the wrong
country?  Now that you've annexed the evil Austro-Hungarian Empire, Russia
would like to officially place her trust in you to defend the Slavs and their
lands.

<p>
(TRENT - EVERYBODY): I apologize for being out of the loop.
I'm here to stay now... knock on wood.

<p>
(ZARR-BURGESS): I hope that this move ends my position in this game.
After having been a staunch player of the game for about twelve years
now, I'm in the process of getting out of the hobby.
I have found that between the work load at the college, my duties
as president of a university alumni association, and my family
obligations, I just don't have the time, energy or interest to put into
the game anymore.
Please keep any money I've sent you once my position has ended.
Please don't send me anymore issues of your diplomacy magazine
once I am out of this game.
Thanks.
<i>((Well, you aren't out yet, at least not until you do or
don't retreat to Greece.
I understand, of course, but will be sorry to lose you.))</i>

1) In the next round, Richard Weiss will be Austria, Sara Reichert will be England,
John Schultz will be France, Heath Gardner will be Germany, Mike Barno will be
Italy, Sandy Kenny will be Russia (remember only four nukes!), and Jody
McCullough will be Turkey.
Note John Schultz' new phone number.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SARA-CALCUTTA): As an office temp, I keep coming across interesting tidbits 
about words.  For example, a friend who speaks Russian informs me that, in 
the Russian language, the term ``black hole" is an obscenity that means 
exactly what you just now thought it meant.  As for copyright violations, you 
will have to sue a multitude of astronomers and physicists.  How many lawyers 
can you afford?

<p>
(MIKE to JOHN):  Since my IDOC-office nukes helped spring you, might you
lay off my home centers now?  Looks like I'll be safely out of the
lead.  Do you still have the nat'l-parks-&amp;-nat'l-monuments book I sent
you?  Hope you'll be using it with a Harley.

<p>
(SARA-GM): I stopped by <i>THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH</i> and found <i>TAP</i> #232 there.  
I assume that my hard copy will arrive in a few days.  It will be delayed, as 
it has to be forwarded to me here in Winnemucca.  (New job, not sure how long 
it will last, so no permanent COA yet.)   But now that I have reliable 
e-mail, you can save some money and stop sending me hard copies.  I'll just 
use what is available at the <i>POUCH</i>.  Mail sent to my Carson address will be 
promptly forwarded.
<i>((Thanks, but no thanks.... postal versions still go out to everyone.
Hope you enjoy Winnemucca!))</i>

<p>
(SARA-SADDAM HUSSEIN): In regards to cross-posting press, your ridiculous 
opinion has been noted.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Ummm... it seems I should say something here.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EMMERT to BOARD): Did somebody say mint juleps?  Actually, I have heard
that the juleps they serve at the Derby are pre-made, en masse, and are
watered down and horrible.  I'll mix my own, thanks, unless I know I've
got a good bartender (of southern extraction; I will never allow a damn
Yankee to mix my julep for me) who's making them one at a time, using
first-rate bourbon.
<i>((Of course, I knew I could count on you!!
Now Scott... well, you will be able to tell which one... goes nuts.
And then... well, read it yourself.))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE to RUSSIA): Phil, you twisted narco addict. What were you high on when
you told the Pope those lies??  OUT OF ENGLAND WITH THEE!  Christians may
offer forgiveness but we burn traitors here. You are a replacement here, so I
still love ya though.

<p>
(PALACE OF BATTENING HATCHES DOWN):  I won't be inspired to write any
press until the highly amusing Big Stab.  Don't worry, Impending Victim,
it isn't you they're whispering about.

<p>
(DIPLOMATIC CORPS WEBMASTER to TAP WEBMASTER):  The latest update adds
your International Subscription Exchange to the postally useful stuff
listings, and a new Awards page including your committee's Hobby Awards
ballot as well as the Marco Poll.  We also added Diplomacy contact
people in our tenth and eleventh nations, and assorted other bits.
<i>((This is http://www.DiplomaticCorps.org of course.....))</i>

(FRANCE to ENGLAND): Terry, you have lapsed back into your coma?  The Question
is can you match your press from last issue?  Please beat me up again big
boy. OOOOOOO, You better run and hide up north cause the boogie man's coming
and it ain't light blue.

<p>
(AUSTRIAN CHAIRMAN OF PROPAGANDA RELATIONS to POPE JIZMO ``SPEEDICUT" 

<p>
 VARONE): I must attest to your recent conduct.
<i>((Really!))</i>
It was indecent, unholy and by God uncivilized.
<i>((You sound like Stuart Smalley, wasn't that his name??))</i>
Even Dante's Virgil &amp; Co. only received a fart from a demon.
What you did, surpassed his most flatulent move...
Rotting!
Urine soaked, Turkish soldiers is a sight that I hope no man will ever see again...

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL JON RHODEHAMEL to THE RUSSIAN HIGH COMMAND):
The War between our Nations has never ended.
Perhaps an end shall be made...

<p>

I have not heard from many of za Ambassadors of late...The Emperor has
decided to wage total war on za silent...        

<p>
(FRANCE to WORLD): Hmmmm, who else can I insult.  Sayers? .... NAH.........
Barno?  No, I love Barno's hair too much.......... 
<i>((What hair???))</i>
Kent?  VE HAV VAYS of making you write.  
<i>((You mean like whatever you call that up above??))</i>
Got to pick up the letters mein comrade.........Pope?
.....HELL NO! Anyone named Scott has to rule.      

<p>
(BOOB to BOARD): And finally, a return to sanity....

<p>
(AND ANOTHER THING FROM EMMERT): My family comprises horseracing fans for
about six minutes a year, during the three Triple Crown races.  I mix a
julep apiece for my wife and myself, and make something called a mint
Boolep for my daughter (who is occasionally referred to as ``Boo"),
consisting of root beer and a mint sprig.  One of our rites of spring.

<p>
1) And something here???

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JAMES to GM): This game has been So Good, but now It Hurts!  One of the joys
of Diplomacy is how quickly things can change, but I like it more when it
changes for the better, speaking of which...

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): OK, OK, I'm eating my words.  Yes, I know, you might
even last longer and end up bigger than me. I can hear you laughing from
here.

<p>
(EMMERT to RUSNAK): Hold on; I need to look up some more four-letter
Anglo-Saxon words to use in my composition on your ancestry and your
personal habits.  It should be ready momentarily.

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): I sincerely doubt that you have anything to teach
Russ on that score.
I hope your Worldmasters Second Round game doesn't look disturbingly
like your position here in short order.

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY AND ENGLAND): I take it it's too late for me to redeem
all those kind notes you guys sent me over the course of the game,
encouraging me that help was coming.

<p>
(JAMES to EMMERT): Can you believe that German!  You would think that
alliances are forever.  A long alliance ending in a two way is every bit as
good as rewarding as a win, don't you think?  I think you have some old
emails hanging around where you explain that in great detail - could you
forward them on to Goz for me please.

<p>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND): I had problems looking at the map when I got new
glasses too.

<p>
(STEVE to PAUL): So, how's it feel to be almost as crippled as I am?

<p>
(JAMES to GOZ): Listen up to what Steve is about to tell you.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD): Okay, okay.  Firm predictions on the season.
You guys have done it, so I guess I should do the same.  AL:  Texas,
Cleveland, and New York win the divisions; Seattle takes the wild card
over the Red Sox.  Cleveland goes to the Series.  NL:  Arizona, Houston,
and Atlanta win the divisions; St. Louis wins the wild card.  Arizona
goes to the Series and loses to the Indians.  Randy Johnson wins the Cy
AND the MVP in the NL; Manny Ramirez wins the AL MVP and Pedro picks up
another Cy.  Howzat?

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB):  I think you covered everything except who you have the Cards
beating in the Series.  Who's the AL champ?
<i>((Damn it, it's the Red Sox, it's the Red Sox, it's the Red Sox.
Go ahead, bring the curse down upon me yet again.... it's all YOUR fault!!))</i>

<p>
(JAMES to WORLD):  I saw the knife a mile away.  I let him put it in deep so
that I wouldn't have to read any more MLB press.  When does college
basketball start again? 
<i>((We've got strange feelings about that around here.
Providence College expelled four players for assaulting some bar bouncers -
all handled SCRUTIATINGLY appropriately in stark contrast to the University
from Indiana - so we're lookin' at another tough season!
But at least we can feel good that we did the right thing.
Keep Head Coach Tim Welsh in your thoughts..... he needs all the help
he can get.
Hey, Richard, wanna send your son out here???))</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY):  We will fight you on the beaches...

<p>
(MORE VIRGINIA BEACH MUSINGS): I am about to reach the stage of clinical
depression over the Stanley Cup playoffs.  In the second round, I was
rooting for San Jose, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Toronto.  Every damn one
of them lost, leaving us with the most boring possible combinations of
teams for the conference finals.  I suppose I will transfer a very
lukewarm rooting interest (and, judging from the results in the last
round, a curse) unto Colorado and Philadelphia to reach the Cup finals.
If the finalists are actually New Jersey and Dallas, I (sigh) may not
watch; those are probably my two least favorite teams in the league.
Bring on next season already.
<i>((Hey, I'll join THAT club....))</i>

<p>
(LONDON to ITALY AND RUSSIA): Looks like us vs them.   Sorry that I used to
be a ``them" and not an ``us".

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Victory in the game is hereby declared to be 29 centers.
I've been debating this one for awhile in my head (with 
some discussion from some of you) and that is my decision.
It is final....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(Scene - the Broslofski house.  Kyle is reading ``The Diary of
Anne Frank".)

<p>
Kyle:  What a boring book!  (Throws book away just as his mother
is walking by.)

<p>
Sheila Broslofski:  WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!  Have you no respect for
your heritage?  (grabs book from trash)  We must always remember
the Holocaust!  (to herself)  We've got to teach these kids the
importance of history.  Time to take a trip to Amsterdam to visit
the Anne Frank house!

<p>
(a few days later, at a PTA meeting.  Mrs. Broslofski has the floor.)

<p>
SB:  ...and do to its historical significance, I suggest that the
kids should take a trip to Amsterdam.  

<p>
Another parent:  But isn't Amsterdam dangerous and corrupt?

<p>
SB:  Oh no, those Dutch are such sweet people!  Windmills and wooden
shoes, tulips, dikes and canals.  What could be sweeter?

<p>
(Eventually they agree to send all the kids to Amsterdam.  Mr.
Garrison, Mr. Mackey, Big Gay Al, and, of course, Chef, are the
chaperones.)

<p>
(Scene:  fifty kids and the three adults pull into their hotel across
from the Amsterdam Central Station.)  

<p>
Mr. Garrison:  OK, everybody get off the bus.  We've got to get
into the hotel and get to sleep.  It's getting late.

<p>
Stan:  Mr. Garrison, what does ``tobacco-free cigarettes" mean?
I see them for sale in the coffee shop across the street.

<p>
Mr. Mackey: Now Stan, you all remember the sample joint I gave you, 
mm-kay?  You got to stay out of that store, mm-kay?

<p>
Stan:  Mm-kay Mr. Mackey!  (Mr. Macky turns his back and Stan
immediately runs off.)  

<p>
(Chef and Al have been whispering). 

<p>
Chef:  Mr. Mackey, do you think you and Mr. Garrison can take care of
checking in?  Al and I will take care of, um, ``supplies" for
tomorrow's trip to the Anne Frank house.  

<p>
Mr. Mackey:  MM-kay, that sounds good.  See you both in a bit!

<p>
(Chef and Al high-five.  They walk away towards a district
strangely lit by a lot of red lights.)  

<p>
Eric Cartman:  Hey, Mr. Garrison, where's the Biergarten?  I want
some Wiener Schnitzel?  

<p>
Kyle: Cartman you idiot, Biergartens are in Germany, and Wiener
Schnitzel is in Austria!

<p>
Cartman: Oh right, ever see a kangaroo with Wiener Schnitzel?  They
don't have Wiener Schnitzel in Austria!  

<p>
(Meanwhile, Kenny is sneaking away into the Holland Casino.  Time
for the Big Rollers.)

<p>
Mr. Garrison: OK, everybody here?

<p>
Cartman:  Hey!  Stan and Kenny are (he's interrupted by a smack from
Kyle)!  You punk!  I'll slap you silly!  

<p>
Kyle: Have to catch me first!  (Runs upstairs.)

<p>
Cartman:  Get back here you hippie tree-hugger!

<p>
(Stay tuned for more adventures of the lovable South Park kids
in the most decadent city in Western civilization!)
