see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
We have yet more exciting issues of <i>By the Way</i>, <i>Houdini Blues</i>, <i>Tinamou</i> 
in this issue.
We're making progress on starting new games, help fill things up, see below for more.
BREAKING AWAY starts in this issue, send me your cards!!!
Since I was late, let's go straight into the Christmas break.
Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARGARET GEMIGNANI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, now, why Margaret?  Margaret, of course, is one of the most famous personalities in 
Dipdom, Science Fiction, Star Trek, Comic, etc. fandom.  
She was a nurse in the DC area, I believe, and then retired to Florida some years ago.
Many people had an address for her in Fort Lauderdale (including me), but that address
went missing around 1994.
If you do Google searching, as I have done off and on, there is a Margaret Gemignani
that contributes to the Baltimore and Ohio Historical Railroad Association, along with 
a husband, Gino (anyone know if that matches.... the B&amp;O matches where she used to live...
but don't tell me, use it as info to go looking yourself!!!)
Margaret has a couple of mentions in the Diplomacy AtoZ and I first encountered her
in the old Bernie Oaklyn <i>Le Front</i> szine.
I think it would be fun to find her.
You have until issue 310 and then we move on to someone else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jeff, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jeff Key or Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<b>WORLDMASTERS04 SECTION</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer, Doug Moore,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.
Actually, the Semifinal games began in October.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen anything on progress in these games,
and that's why.
More on that next issue!!!
Thomas Franke and David Partridge are in a game together that seems
on first glance to be the weakest in the rest of the players.
So my first thought is that one of those two will have a slot in
the finals.
I am getting raked over the coals for it, but I just ended a game
in a three way draw between me, Thomas, and Ray Setzer that I might
have had a chance in ekeing out a win mostly because Thomas asked
for it to end so he could focus on this semi-final.
Sorry, David, but I had to do it.....
Of course, after saying that, David Partridge is in England getting beaten
on by Guy Thomas in France, who is allied with Thomas Franke in Italy.
But Italy has a Juggernaut bearing down on him from Mike Tombu and
Julio Cardoza.
And Toby Harris just got crunched in his game where he is Turkey, but
I don't count him out yet, he has more lives than a cat!!
But never mind, I don't know how ANY of this will turn out!!!
Doug Moore is doing pretty well as Russia in his game so far, but
Russia can always be crunched after doing well early.
Buffalo is doing pretty well in his game as France taking down Germany
and now attacking Adam Silverman's England, I think, that part is still
developing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where some of this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
I had to go the main Worldmasters site at www.worldmasters.net/wm04/ to
find some of these results.
The new Tournament rankings for FTF also are out there that supercede the
ones that were on 18centres.
Go check out:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://eurodip.nuxit.net/php/ranking/affiche_ranking.php?id_ranking=3&amp;lang=Ang

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It ranks 4788 FTF players and is the most complete known compilation of FTF play
ever in the hobby.
You really want to check it out.
Poor Eve Smith ends up 4788th, having been in 33 tournaments in the last ten years,
an achievement in itself!
And of course Don Del Grande is down near the bottom at 4784th, off of 13 tournaments,
two of them in Australia.
For having the Don Challenge Cup named after him, he didn't do THAT badly in his
tournaments Down Under, better than I'd been led to believe at 54/78 and 34/57
And Frank Johansen is a well deserved #1.
And I'm amazingly in the top quarter with a ranking of 1171, accurately reflecting
the nine tournaments that I know I've been to (i.e. I don't see any missing).
Yann Clouet (if I counted right) has been to 95 tournaments, I'd be surprised if
someone surpasses him in number, and he ranks 9th.
Guaranteed to be a fun browse....

Note that Andrew Neumann had taken 
over the lead editorship from Tim Haffey, but he clearly wasn't up to it.
So, I'm officially looking for a lead editor again.
As we have had for the last five years or so, the Pouch is back up and
running again, and Diplomacy World is dead in the water, it seems that is
the way it is.
One runs, and the other one stops.
This occurs even though there really is no direct connection.
If you'd like to do this, let me know, I make it pretty easy, but I
CANNOT be lead editor for two szines at once, I just can't.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You all should read the interview in the Spring 2005 movement issue
of the <i>Diplomatic Pouch</i> (and I mean ALL!!!!!!! of you!!!!!)
that I think you can find at: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S2005M/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not sure what is going to happen now, but basically everywhere 
except in Russia the game pretty much failed.
The AI was not good (not a huge surprise) and it just required too many
updates to get it to work.
Besides, it really was designed for "real time" play and everyone
doesn't want that.
To find out more general information on DIPLOMACY please visit
www.diplomacy-pcgame.com or contact pr of paradoxplaza.com
but I think it is about to wither away and die.
In sum, I think that is too bad.
But the hobby as a whole is going strong with thousands and thousands of
Diplomacy players worldwide.
REALLY!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The product that tried to do what you are talking about was designed by 
Paradox, released in Feb. 2005.  But by all accounts I've heard, it became 
very popular in Russia, but hasn't done very well in the English speaking 
world.  You can find out more at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=295

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The posts in there explain how Paradox tried and basically gave up to do 
what you're asking.  This is because Diplomacy is a deceptively complex 
game.  VERY deceptively complex because it appears to be so simple on a 
number of levels.  Perhaps this is what draws you to the game.  If so, I 
would urge you to dare to play with humans at a slower pace.  It really 
does reward the effort.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think you can still purchase the Paradox game and play it, and if you 
read the posts above, you won't have overly high expectations to be 
dashed.  I think one can learn about the game via Paradox's product, but 
you will quickly become bored with it, especially playing against 6 
computer bots, and will come out to play the real thing.

We're running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
late.
Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number, scores are in parentheses) 
is, in alphabetical order, 
Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper (1), Dick Martin, Richard Smith (3), Joakim Spangberg, and Brad Wilson (4).
The linking theme thing didn't seem to go over too well.
No one really figured out the true linking theme.  
Rick Desper was using Underground tube stops and songs with that as the title,
they were things like that.  
I'll let you guys talk a bit to each other on that with your guesses.
I have added some kind of comment on each tune.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: two more tunes (seven if you're joining up new, four if you NTRed (NO TUNES
RECEIVED!!) and want to get back in), your guesses as to who
submitted which lists, and guesses about people's themes if any.
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Here are your guesses and comments (also alphabetical order):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick Desper: Since you wrote comments for all the picks, 
that means you are faking comments?
<i>((Yessiree, I did it really well the first time, didn't I?
This time I fell down a little.))</i>
Well, I have no freakin' idea who picked what.  Half the players I don't know at
all.  And by "half" I mean "everybody but you and Emmert".  
I'll say Emmert picked #1 (NO) and you picked #3 (YES).
<i>((You score one point, as a mathematician like you should know, 
you CAN earn points here for guessing.))</i>
For an off-game bonus, do you know Ricky Gervais?

<i>((Of course, but I am not a huge fan.

is something about the women playing the secretaries in both "Offices"
that you can't take your eyes off, but no, I'm not a big fan.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Richard Smith: Guesses:
1. Brendan Whyte  (YES);
2. Brad Wilson (NO);
3. Jim-Bob Burgess (YES);
4. Rick Desper (NO);
5. Richard Smith (THAT'S YOU no pts.);
6. Doug Kent  (NO);
7. Steve Emmert (NO);
8. Dick Martin  (YES).
<i>((That gives you three points. 
Not bad for joining the szine right now to play.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Brad Wilson: I must have missed the part about themes, because Lord
knows I didn't have one.
Anyway, my guesses (and theme guess if any):
1) Whyte - choral singing (YES, no real theme, though you're right they were choral);
2) Kent  (YES);
3) you   (YES);
4) Smith  (NO);
5) Desper  (NO);
6) Emmert  (NO);
8) Dick Martin  (YES).
I'll be damned if I get any other "themes". I'm kinda
dense these days.
<i>((You did hit four points, that's pretty good!
You're way ahead with NTR's.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #1 for TURN 2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Das Ich - Keimzeit:
Weirdest looking act I've ever seen. 
I've got mental picture of these guys fetching their children from daycare... 
I'd bet they would would have to go home empty handed most of times.
<i>((OK, I knew it would happen, we would hit a song I just don't know.
So you know this isn't me.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Einst&#252;rzende Neubauten - Seele Brennt:
Usually delivering interesting soundscapes though sometimes being more silly than challenging.
<i>((I actually do know this song, I like it, a bit cutesy, but a bit more interesting
than you indicate, compares favorably to the masters of soundscape, Stereolab.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #2 for TURN 2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Rammstein - Links 234 (Live):
German heavy metal band Rammstein are without doubt one of the best live 
acts in the world. This track is from the Volkerball DVD which features 
them in all their glory - pyrotechnics, costumes, blood, sado-masochism, 
and most of all arsch-kicking rock 'n' roll. They have been accused of 
many things including homoerotic symbolism and being Nazis. My chosen 
track is about their repudiation of the latter. The words contain "we 
sound right but we think left" whilst the music (deliberately) sounds a 
bit "zieg heil". Works for me, whenever I listen to it I have a strange 
urge to annex my next-door neighbors :-) 
<i>((Ah, heck, everyone's going to know this isn't me either.
I really like the next song, but this one leaves me cold, maybe I do need
to hear it live.
I do find your note about the lyrics intriguing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Porcupine Tree - Hatesong (Live):
British art-rock quartet Porcupine Tree have been getting increasingly
popular in America following two successful albums "In Absentia" and 
"Deadwing". This track is from the "Arriving Somewhere" DVD filmed in 
Chicago last year. Wow, awesome gig! The track I've chosen is "Hatesong" 
which is one of the highlights of the show with a total wig-out guitar 
solo and fantastic drumming. I can't get enough of these guys, they make 
other bands look like bumbling amateurs!
<i>((Damned straight.
To me, much of the last five or six years has been low on invention and
sincere energy, but NOT from these guys, possibly the best band around
right now who is not the Mekons.... ;-)  ))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #3 for TURN 2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) "April in Paris", Count Basie and His Orchestra
(Verve, recorded 1955, released 1956): Like listening
to liquid chocolate, so velvety and creamy and rich.
The post-war Basie band at its absolute swinging,
so-tight-it's-loose peak. Thad Jones never sounded
better on trumpet. Sizzling arrangement. The best
dance music ever written.
<i>((I honestly don't get why this music isn't 
heard more.
I like some headbanging as much as the next bloke, 
but sometimes you want to glide around the dance floor,
well at least dream about gliding around the dance floor
to the likes of this.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) "The Goodbye Look", Donald Fagen (from "The
Nightfly", Warner Brothers, 1982): A nasty little gem,
overshadowed on this LP by the title track and the
bouncy "I.G.Y.", but still a classic piece of cynicism
and detachment from half of the grandly bitter duo
known as Steely Dan. Set in somewhere south of Key
West, Fagen's troubled resort is anything but
Margaritaville. Anyone who likes Steely Dan should
have Fagen's solo discs.
<i>((Go listen to Steely Dan again, you might have pooh-poohed it
in 1978, pledging your allegiance to Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson, 
but you would be wrong.
It's interesting how this post-Steely Dan material garnered such
little attention.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #4 for TURN 2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) "Mad World" performed by Gary Jules for the Donnie Darko sound
track, covering a Tears for Fears song.
Donnie Darko is a great film and this tune really captures 
its spirit of confusion and pain.  
Also, one of the more inventive SF films of recent years.
<i>((I don't know why this film was so overlooked.
I pretty much watch EVERY SF film that comes down the pike, so I can't
easily tell, but this one seemed to be overlooked.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) "Praise you" by Fatboy Slim.  The video is priceless.
<i>((Nuff said.
There is no more.
I still think in many ways the "first video" ("Video Killed the Radio Star"
by the Buggles is the best, but this really IS the best video ever.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #5 in TURN 2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) "Instrumental Introduction/Don't Look Down", Lindsey Buckingham: The 
first time I heard this I just kinda shrugged and said, "eh". Second 
time I thought it maybe wasn't such a weak song after all. Third 
time...I couldn't take it out of the CD player for a month. It's 
beautifully played pop music that is just off-center enough to stay 
fresh no matter how often it's played.
<i>((I used to like skating to this song a huge amount.  I'm not
sure why, not sure if it ever has been used by a major figure skater,
but they should think about it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) "Sweet Marie" (live), Hothouse Flowers:  This is about as close as it 
gets to putting pure emotion into song. It's a gospelly breakup song, 
sung to the girl that's just left him.  He's still in love, but knows 
that it's not going to work.  Mildly irrational, sweetly romantic, 
wishing the best for the woman he loves but can't have.  Time to just 
carry on and savor the feelings because they're all you have left.  I've 
been there.
<i>((This is another band that is really cool live, and if you've
not heard this song live, go take a listen.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />MYSTERY PERSON #6 in TURN 2:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) "Muddy Waters" from Pere Ubu: This is off the 1998 <i>Pennsylvania</i> CD.
The record as a whole is quite frankly still way ahead of its time, nearly ten
years after it was recorded.
There isn't anything quite yet like David Thomas and Pere Ubu even now.
This track is unlike the other tracks on the album, but heck you could say
that about almost every track.
I'd not listened to this in some time, and it was immensely rewarding to hear it
again.
As far as this track goes, well, it doesn't sound like Muddy, not really anyway,
but Muddy is part of the inspiration that underlies the work here.
Reminds me in many ways of Zappa as it salutes Muddy without imitating him.
<i>((This tune is the middle point of the album (7th track), the best two other songs are "Woolie
Bullie" that leads off the CD and "Wheelhouse" which ends the disc as the 15th
track. 
Great choice, this is a much overlooked CD, it was reissued last year as I believe
the original label for it folded.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) "Girls and Boys" from Blur (pet shop boys mix): The two pet shop boys mixes
on the single are both much better than the base song (one of them is four minutes,
ther other over seven) of this classic 1994 anthem.
It anticipates the metrosexual movement (theme here is songs ahead of their times)
with the deliciously ambiguous "Girls who are boys,
Who like boys to be girls, Who do boys like they're girls,
Who do girls like they're boys,
Always should be someone you really love!"
<i>((<b>TAP</b> has always been a Blur over Oasis szine, and this was one
of the heights of the Blur movement.
If you have to ask who Blur and Oasis were, then of course this isn't going
to make any sense even were I to explain it to you.
Pop music debates are kinda like that, aren't they???))</i>

Players: there are 7 players in the game, one for each of the major
powers in Europe in 1901: England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria,
Russia and Turkey (E-F-G-I-A-R-T)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Turns are divided : Spring and Fall with the game starting in Spring 1901.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You are not bound by anything you say or do with another player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Players secretly write down their orders for their pieces and then
they are revealed and adjudicated simultaneously.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Abbreviations in order writing are listed on the conference map with S
for Support and C for Convoy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is no discussion when players have to retreat or make
adjustments to their positions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The map is divided into different named spaces. Click here to view a
Standard map.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spaces can be all water, all land or coastal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are 34 supply centers on the map (stars/dots) scattered in 60+
named spaces.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To win you need 18 supply centers at the end of a Fall move.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Players start with 3 or 4 supply centers; these are your home centers
in one of 7 Great Powers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two piece types are: Army and Fleet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For every supply center you own at the end of the Fall you may have
one piece on the board.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you are short of pieces you build new ones in unoccupied home centers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you have more pieces than supply centers you must reduce your
pieces to equal the number of supply centers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Each piece has equal strength so it moves with a force of 1 plus 1 for
each of its supports.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An Army may move or give support into an adjacent land or coastal province.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A Fleet may move or give support into an adjacent water or coastal province.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Only one piece may be in a space at any time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Your piece may only do one thing in any turn:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MOVE to an adjacent space or be convoyed from a coastal province to a
coastal province. Fleets in split coasts may only move to adjacent
coastal or water spaces.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
SUPPORT to defend another adjacent piece in place if you could have
moved there and it is not moving.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
SUPPORT an attack on another piece's space that your unit could move
to; fleets in split coasts may only support moves into a space that
they could have moved on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CONVOY if a fleet, you can assist in convoying an army.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
HOLD (also called Stand) in place doing nothing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A piece moves only one space at a time to an adjacent space unless you
are an Army being convoyed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No switching. Units ordered to each other's space do NOT switch
positions unless one is being convoyed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When giving support you are adding your force to the mover on, or the
holder of, a space.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may support other peoples pieces.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bounce: if units of equal support try to move to an unoccupied space
then they BOUNCE and no one gets in.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Supports are CUT by a piece moving on the supporter from other than
the space that the support is directed at.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To force someone out of a space requires that you have greater force
than the piece that is holding the space plus all of its supports to
Hold. A move with one support and a hold with one support bounce.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cut supports do not count for the determination of who has the most force.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A convoy is a move of an army in a coastal province to another by a
fleet or a chain of fleets in adjacent water spaces.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A fleet in a coastal province may not convoy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can not dislodge or cut support of one of your own units. No
'friendly fire'.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Units forced out of their space are dislodged and must RETREAT to an
adjacent space.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may not retreat to a space that was the site of a Bounce.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You may not retreat via a convoy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you can not retreat or decide not to retreat, the piece is disbanded.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A piece that is DISLODGED has no effect on the space from which the
mover came that dislodged it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A convoying fleet that is dislodged disrupts the convoy and the convoy
does not take place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oddities: Kiel and Constantinople have a single coast due to their
waterways (Kiel Canal/Bosphorus). Denmark is a coastal province that
connects with Sweden so armies can go between them but does not divide
itself or the Swedish coast in two. As a coastal province you may not
convoy through Denmark, Kiel or Constantinople.

assemble late.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>GAME TURN SCHEDULE:</b> Run games on Central Clock with possible delayed
exception of "final board" for each round.  20 minutes per Spring and
Fall season with builds and retreats taken out of negotiation time run
as quickly as possible.

Voting on Draws/Game Stop: Comes out of negotiation time, Tournament
Director discretion can be disallowed or delayed for repeated
requests.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Limit on Players: 28 players or four boards (but this could be raised
prior to the event if there is indication that more players are coming
from the advance Diplomacy hobby publicity)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Scoring System: Detour98f</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the scoring system used for most New Zealand tournaments and
New England tournaments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you survive to 1905 then you get a point (whether you're
eliminated later or not).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you are in the draw at the end of the game then you get a point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- You get a point for every supply centre you own.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you are in the outright lead then you get a bonus of the
difference between you and the next best player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you are first on the board you get 4 bonus points, if you are
second you get 3 bonus points, if you are third you get 2 bonus
points, if you're fourth you get 1 bonus point. (If there's a tie you
get the points for the lower position -ie equal 2nd both get 2 bonus
points)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- You add each person's points to get a raw score. The next step is to
standardize the game. Divide each person's raw score with the sum of
all the raw scores and then multiply by 100. This generate a
percentage for everyone. So an entire game is worth 100 points and how
much of those points that each person gets is determined points 1-5.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- If you solo you get 110 points and everyone else gets *nothing*.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Tournament Scoring: Total points across the three rounds will be
scored with the last round featuring a Top Board featuring the top
seven players playing the last round based on scores in the first two
rounds.  Scoring on the Top Board will be doubled for Tournament
Scoring purposes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- There also will be Best Country awards for each of the seven
countries which can be won by people who play only one round.  For
purposes of Best Country scoring, scores on the Top Board will not be
doubled.

Mel Nicholson (who is getting married on March 9th back in New Zealand, congrats
Mel!!!) brought us the Detour scoring system to us in New England from New Zealand,
where she originates obviously.
I really like the balance in Detour, it isn't as earthshatteringly stark as my
own scoring system which really demands play out to the bitter end, and it rewards
Supply Centers, but not TOO much.
Plus it's easy to figure.
I am doing it with a Top Board on the last day (which depending on attendance may
not be THAT much of a Top Board) to minimize the fact that people could easily 
figure out who was leading.  
This will put the leaders on the same board on Sunday.

Last chance for anyone who was a subber to <i>Ishkibibble</i> to join any new
game for free, but this is a ONE TIME only offer, get your request in now.
It is going to expire VERY shortly.
Marc Ellinger and Fred Wiedemeyer already have taken us up on this request.
Come on, let me call by name who qualifies
for this deal..... Karl Schmit, John Power, Tim Snyder,
Dave Partridge, Graham Wilson, and Kevin Wilson.
I especially would like to fill the Modern Diplomacy game that Dave Partridge
already is in.
As soon as one more game fills (I'm not counting the new Breaking Away game), 
I'm going to pull this offer.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) You now get the Christmas break to ponder your builds.
Lots more press this time.
Just a reminder, that press in this szine is "Black", which means anything
can come from anywhere.
Your imagination is the limit, except that my strategy for stopping feuding
(not to say any is going on, as it doesn't seem to be) is that if you abuse
other players in the Black Press, you need to abuse ME as much or more than
anyone else, so I can join in on the FUN!
In other words, keep the abuse coming, we love it, we masochistic Boobishness
GMish Jim-Bobs of the world.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to GERMANY):  So you know, I will attempt with my friends 
(whoever they are and wherever they may appear from) to make you a 
more attempting target to London than I am.  
Given his knack for backstabbing, I'm sure it won't take long for him 
to come around to my way of thinking ... I'm guessing - hoping? - 
there'll be enough blood in the water this season to convince him 
to strike you next season with his shiny new units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE):  The silence is deafening.  Sorry, but we had no choice.
I assume we will be bouncing this season.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND):  Obviously, your spies were wrong and I did exactly 
as promised.  I would ask you to have them shot but your 
lack of correspondence or apology puts lie to comments; 
it appears you lie as much in the press as you do in your correspondence.  
En garde, Monsieur ... I'm yours!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS to ROME):  To the uttermost, mon ami!  I am yours in spirit and steel!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS to BREST):  Those dreadnaughts in the Channel are bluffing.  
Trust us - we're from the central government and we're here to help.  
Now get those militia down to the beaches!  Quickly!  Quickly!  
And those bank security guards!  And don't forget the school hall pass monitors!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(F MID to F CHA):  You ARE bluffing, aren't you?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SYRACUSE to WORLD):  College basketball season has started at last and
football is finally over (at least for bad teams like SU).  My last and only
comment on football is that Rutgers is now SU and SU is now Rutgers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LE REPUBLIQUE to SUBLIME PORTE):  Nothing against the Tsar, but nicely done.  
Haven't seen that attack come off so well in years ... or at least not 
since I did it to Burgess!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TAWNY PORT): Serve me up another, that last one was REAL smooth.
I am so smooth that I cannot be surprised like that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to BOOB):  Did too!  Did too!  Did too!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to MS. CHARLOTTE):  When are you going to wise up and trade you-know-who in 
for a better model?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to HANDSOMER MODEL): You know she doesn't read this dreck, ESPECIALLY your dreck.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to TSAR):  Good luck, my friend.  For what it's worth, 
I appear to be about to keep England and Germany occupied for five or six years.  
You can thank me later.  (I'll be looking for you at the bar ... make mine a pale lager ... )

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TSAR): I hope you can get something decent down in the wilds of Texas, do they
still drink that rattlesnake wine that the French send there?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FIREBALL XL5 to STAR DRECK PRESS):  Oh, c'mon, O'Donnell, not this merde again.  
Keep it up and you'll outdo Boob for mirthless press, and that 
*would* be an accomplishment.  If you are going to take up space 
in this press column, make it amusing, interesting, informative, 
obscure, infamous, or - failing all else - scandalously libelous.  
Anything else is mindless Burgesspew.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB LAMENTS): I resemble that remark....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BACKFIRE to BASE): Maneuvers Acceptable

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FIREBALL XL5 to ABYSSINIAN PRESS MERCHANT):  Uh, no offense intended.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB LIGHTS UP THE FIREBALL): Good, if you're not trying to offend me, then 
stop bugging my bud Jeff.
You know the <i>TAP</i> House Rules!
If you are, then let's have at it, FLAME ON!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FIREBALL XL5 to NOSTROMO, BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA, RED FIVE, THUNDERBIRD 4 AND SERENITY):  
If the Star Dreck press doesn't improve immediately (or sooner) 
I say we phaser his ass right into the next universe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to BURGESS the YOUNGER): ... and better looking and smarter.  
Stay the course.  We love you over here in Burgundy.  Let's ally and sweep the board!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS to BASQUE SEPARATISTS): Stay put for a few years, will you?  
We have a lovely bit of property we're willing to turn over to 
you in a couple years - good for starting your own little country.  
(Be quiet and don't tell anyone, but it's that bit east of 
itain-bray known as ermany-gay.  Shhh!  Mum's the word!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MALICEFILLED TAPPITES): What we saw last issue does not seem to be the
last we've heard of poor little Malice.
You will have to fill yourselves up yet further.
If anyone is in danger of exploding from too much Malice..... well, tough, here's
more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MALICE IN CENTERLAND - Part Two:  A Simple Desultory Poem):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Malice eventually decided that being kept by a demon was not as bad 
as it sounded.  First, nothing in his life was different due 
to his new knowledge of his captivity.  
There were no chains, cages, bars, fetters, locked doors - nothing.  
He still fed Don daily, and they now talked where they had not 
done so before, but that was the only change.  
And as the days went by Malice learned many things.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 One fall day they followed the dirt road into the local woods to read.  
The demon brought a favored strategy article while Malice had the 
latest issue of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>.  
(It had arrived several months late as usual, but Malice didn't mind.)  
They walked for some time before entering a small clearing 
where the dappled sunlight and a tiny rippling stream made 
things pleasant in the waning warmth of the afternoon.  
Don stopped, noticing where the road split on the other 
side of the clearing.  
The demon without thinking began to mutter, as if to himself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, 
sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler, 
long I stood and looked down the one as far as I could to 
where it bent in the undergrowth ... ."  
His voice trailed off.  
Malice, restless and distracted at the first whiff of anything 
literary or uplifting, started thumbing the pages of <i>TAP</i>.  
"I don't like where this is going," said the demon.  
"It's the wrong poem, Malice, but it surely bears witness.  
It has meaning... yes, it does.  
It's about choosing a road or a path or, more correctly, 
choosing one path over another and considering consequences later.  
I think this means it's time, Malice."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "Time?  Time for what?  We just got here," said Malice, 
not looking up from the szine.  
But Don did not answer and, instead, stood in uffish 
thought for a few moments before he started intoning another poem:

<br /><i>(*  It didn't really disappear.  
It was stuck to the underside of the tablet and 
Monde the Demon found it later.  No, really ...trust us on this one ,eh?  The Author.)</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Don ended his lengthy recital and, pleased with himself, 
looked over to Malice whose eyes - alas - had rolled 
completely back into his head under the epic onslaught.  
The demon slapped Malice's cheeks a few times, and momentarily, he came around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "Merde!  You ever do that again and - demon or not - I'll kick your horned ass."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "Sorry, Malice," said Don, sheepishly, "but you must understand 
what's at stake.  The Maltese Dipcon - the Diplonomicon - 
is a weapon of immense and catastrophic power.  
It was forged deep in the volcanic fire of ancient Malta by 
Archbale All-Man, a Grand Magus and Master of the Tarot.  
The tablet - the board, that is - and blocks are manifestations 
of the dark forces of the Tarot.  
They don't just augur the fate and doom of humanity but - in the wrong hands - 
they create it.  The 22 starting positions of the stones on the 
tablet represent the 22 cards of the Major Arcana.  
They portray by mythic symbol the virtues and defects of Humankind.  
The 112 stones, 56 of each in two shapes divided into seven colors, 
represent the 56 cards of the Minor Arcana.  
They play out man's unfolding doom."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "You done yet?" asked Alex, "Because, apart from boring the 
piss out of me, you're getting more than a little weird with all this 
`major' and `minor' Arkansas crap."
In response, the demon silently removed from his neck the amulet and, 
dropping it to the ground, began chanting:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />
<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
"Imido clop non, lipid mono con</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /> Alex felt rather than heard the low, slow thrum 
as the land beneath his feet began to writhe and change as 
the demon's chant trailed off.  The tiny stream widened to a brook.  
Inexplicably, he found himself nearly asleep under a nearby 
tree beside the brook, <i>TAP</i> in his lap, fluttering slightly 
in the cooling breeze.  The landscape had shape-shifted and 
warped in all directions at once and, suddenly, nothing was the same.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "The time for the Dipcon to be re-gathered is upon us, 
Malice," spoke Don lowly, almost to himself.  
"For better or worse, you are the Hero-Fool foretold in legend 
and this task falls to you, unbidden.  It is your quest, and yours alone.  
Sort of a major `oopsie' if you ask me, but there it is.  
Good luck, youre gonna need.  Were all gonna need it."  
The breeze muffled his words, kept Malice from hearing the last of them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "It's a good thing," said Don as he slowly vanished, 
his wings disappearing last.

1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that Jeff O'Donnell has changed his postal address, at least temporarily.
And you should use his cell phone number above if you want to call him, I think.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Since we have the long Christmas break deadline coming up and there are
no Summer adjustments, if everyone would like to submit Fall orders by
January 13th, I can go ahead with that turn at that time.
Let me know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND):  Okay, be a pest.  But you will not even slow down my 
advance.  That is the problem with starting the game insisting this and that.  I 
never could bend over for tyrants.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SALUTES FRENCH TACTICAL PROWESS): The move for England indeed would have been to 
move to Gascony.  The way for England now is dire.

You can send endgame statements any time now.
I have some comments in hand from Kevin Wilson that he wrote three or four months ago
which I will use next issue.
Thanks to everyone who played!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Send in your riders and their starting cards NOW!!!
Your A rider can have three or four cards that need to add up to 30,
your B rider three cards adding up to 25, your C rider three cards
adding up to 20, and your D rider three cards adding up to 16.
You also need to name your team, and can have a team captain if you want.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The name of this new game is CAST NO SHADOWS, a great name for a pelaton based
game.
But of course, this is a very excellent Mekons song.
