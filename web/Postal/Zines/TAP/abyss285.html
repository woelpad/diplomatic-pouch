<br /><br />Well, this absurdly long election season is almost over and the next time I 
send out an issue, I'll do it in the context of new elected US politicians.
More interestingly, in many ways, we should also know who the new Afghan 
president is.  
I've really been enjoying the BBC Radio World Service coverage of this 
election by Lise Doucette.
It does like like Hamid Karzai will win, but the process has been fascinating.
We all should have been watching this much closer for lessons about how
things will go in Iraq, although Iraq surely will be MUCH more complicated
and difficult.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't want to go into repetitive detail on issues surrounding these two
parties and these two candidates over here, since this has been covered to
death and has gone on forever.
I was reminded of JUST how long in the Vice Presidential Debate and all of
that discussion about whether Dick Cheney did or did not ever meet John
Edwards before (in the end, of course, he had, but he had forgotten).
I can remember when this all started and I knew Edwards' name and a tiny
bit about him, but did not even know what he looked like.
And now, I was looking at him here and I feel as if I've lived with him in
my head and mind for a decade.
But the one issue that I think has not been played up enough, but is a big
reason for the polarization of the electorate, is related to the one you 
hear about Bush being a religious guy who acts and believes once he acts he
doesn't have to admit mistakes, vs. an introspective guy like Kerry who 
debates issues with himself and does admit to mistakes and tries to learn
from them (both styles, of course, have strengths and weaknesses and are
better for addressing different types of problems and one could discuss if
we think the problems are more suited to Bush favored or Kerry favored ones,
but that is NOT my point here).  
No, the issue is a fundamental one of your view of the context of situations
"on the ground" (to use the overused phrase in the way it REALLY is meant).
The issue is whether one tries very hard to do as well as one can to walk in
the other people's moccasins and see the world as they see it.  And then
you align what you're doing to the way people actually behave.
This is difficult because you really have to spend a lot of time looking
and listening and getting beyond surface reasons why people appear to do
what they do.
Anthropologists are the profession I can think of that is most organized
this way in their thinking.
Or, do you try to change people's actions through rules and changing the 
way people are and issue the orders and directives and try to motivate 
people to walk in YOUR moccasins.
This is difficult (e.g. in Iraq at the moment) because you have to 
keep pushing and pulling until people are moving closely enough 
in the way you want them to in order to accomplish your goals.
Business CEO's (and this is the real sense in which George is the
MBA president, in this attitude) are the stereotypical profession
that is most organized this way in their thinking, but I'd argue
that it is the middle manager in a bureaucracy that spends their
time writing directives because they are trying to manage a situation
with a very wide scope of control efficiently is a better model.
Both paths are difficult, but you spend your time fighting and working
on very different things.
And most people in their everyday lives primarily do one of these or
the other too, and have trouble seeing why or how the other approach 
can be done at all.
To me, this is the key difference between John Kerry and George Bush that 
people don't talk about enough.  It is there, but buried in the rhetoric.
And people's attitudes about this tend to be lodged deep in their souls,
nearly impossible to change or re-direct.  You may recall that Clinton did
the "feel your pain" aspect of the Kerry side of this far better than
Kerry does. 
But the key is that I don't believe you can argue about this, and in fact,
most of you will be so buried in one side of this or the other by your 
basic personality that you may not even be able to see the distinction 
I'm making.
But I'll bet your attitude toward this point determines which person
you're going to vote for.
If anyone looks at this basic test and comes up with a diametrically
opposed voting preference, I'd be REAL interested to know how and why.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Last issue was a bit of a mailing disaster as I couldn't get to the post office
for days after I printed the issue.
This especially affected some of the foreign mailings, and for that I apologize.
I'm going to make the attempt to be more organized this time and in the future.
As a result, I was very loose with deadlines for this issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, we can bag that Jim-Bob plea.... John Caruso has decided to fold his 
baseball league.
I did make the playoffs, so I will strive to win the last championship.
More on that next time.
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net in the meantime if you want to 
get in touch before he changes his E-Mail address, since he will no

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR WHO SHOULD WE DAMN NEXT??</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm a bit fresh out of ideas over people to find, does someone else
have some suggestions?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Map Collection, ERC Library, University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
That's a relatively new address adjustment.

which will be held in Berlin, Germany.
I've never been to Germany and that seems like as good an excuse as any to go.
As a beginning to getting used to the idea of this, the German group ran
Euro DipCon this year, here are the results and some introductions to 
some of the players who you're likely to see..... this all comes courtesy
of my good pal Frank Bacher who is one of the nicest Diplomacy players
you're ever likely to meet.))</i>

EuropeanDipCon XII Results</td></tr></table><!--hboxt--> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All, here is a short review of EDC XII from an organizer's perspective:
EDC XII at Darmstadt is now history and we hope a part of history most of
you will remember with a good feeling. We actually got that impression
from many of you. What we want to deliver to all of you as a small token
of our gratitude is this review, complete with pictures and results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
   Thursday - The Day all those bloodthirsty and/or snuggling Diplomats met
first

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Traditionally the first day of a German Con is a day to drink, chat and
play games together in a friendly evironment without getting involved in
any tournament. Well, except the few guys who need that special kick every
day and decided to take part in the Macchiavelli tournament game. We felt
that this was a good start for the tourney to meet once under friendly
conditions without any need to stab your neighbour though of course some
couldn't resist playing our beloved game anyway. Particularly interesting
was a "tradition" born this evening for the leader to wear a yellow jersey
as kind of a bull's eye. As there was no leader yet Yann Clouet, the
reigning Champion, "had to" wear it. For those who found this somehow
strange: It was never planned that way and just happened :D. Originally
the TD or one of the organizers should have worn it. As none of us was too
keen on wearing it, Yann got it and it never left the tourney through all
those rounds. Who knows, maybe it becomes a tradition... For some it was
already a long night with the last players attending their beds around 5
a.m.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Friday - Day of truth but never truce

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After breakfast far too early in the morning for some if not most, the
tourney finally started and guess what, Monsieur Clouet didn't show up in
his "new" shirt deciding to take a longer nap instead. Well, enough
players to fill the impressive number of 9 Boards showed up any way. After
the first round a new target was born: Doug Massie impressively taking the
lead with 15-7-6-5-1 top as Germany. After that much excitement and stress
it was time to relax for the players while waiting for BBQ that was
planned a bit later. However, some of the very sportive gives couldn't be
stopped from having a match of soccer in the field, which was more like a
pond of mud due to the rainy weather.
<i>((Doug is a really careful player, but once he gets ahead in a tournament
he tends to get nervous and has a bit of trouble.
I shouldn't talk, since I never even get in Doug's position, but
if I had been there I would have tried to get Doug to calm down a bit
and root for him to continue to stay near the top.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just after the first 20 or so players had shown up, we at the grills
started to realize what we got ourselves into with feeding 80 hungry and
dangerous backstabbers. Even worse: They all had weapons now and they all
wanted dinner... Somehow the guys and gals at the grills survived the rush
and finally everyone was fed and ready to rumble again. A bit late because
of the traffic jam at the BBQ finally the second round started (those
knifes were back in the kitchen luckily...): some diplomats had fed
themselves a bit too much it seems as this round saw some very high
results. This time Fredegone Hendrake (F) took the best result with 47.018
points from a 14-8-6-5-1 as France. However this round saw fewer high
results and fewer tables (7), probably because everyone ate too much and
therefore was missing their killer instinct. Afterwards, the now already usual
gaming, drinking and chatting took place while rumours went round that
some players got into bed fairly early...
<i>I don't know Fredegone, but I'll bet Doug Massie was one of those
up playing card games until late in the night, I remember doing that with
him at World DipCon in Paris a few years ago.... I wonder if Frank was one
of the early to bedders, which is why he isn't describing MORE of this...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Saturday - Another chance for lots of nasty stabs

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once again an early breakfast with the first round that was the team
round afterwards. Despite 10 boards it seemed that some players didn't
sleep enough (or maybe some guys were hypermotivated because of the team
thingy... ) as this round saw even more unusually high scores than the other
rounds, the highest being Edi Birsan's 50.503 points from a 15-9-5-4-1
Italy but with two more results over 47 points by Cyrille Sevin (15 center
Turkey) and Vincent Carry (14 center England). Amazingly enough the team
round was won by a team which called itself "Five in a Row" having won the
four previous EDC Team competitions. Well guessed, they were right!
Congrats to Yann Clouet (F), Cyrille Sevin (F) and Fearghal O'Donnchu
(Ire, better known as Twerg). 
<i>((Wow, that is a team, the reigning World DipCon champion, another
two time World DipCon Champion and the dancing elf Twerg.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After the first round the first part of the
EDA (European Diplomacy Association) meeting happened. The Dutch hobby
presented their bid for EDC 2005 which was accepted and welcomed by all
players. Afterwards most people took their time off while some ventured
into smaller workgroups to discuss charter and stuff like web presences.
After dinner another round of Diplomacy was scheduled and for all those
who are thinking now: "Hey wait a minute 4 rounds already and a Sunday
morning round?" Yeah you're right, but players could only participate in
four rounds of which the best three results were counted for the overall
ranking.
Anyway once again the trend continued and less players signed up for the
late round which was scheduled to end around 01.00 a.m. This round was the
only round without a result higher than 40 points indeed with Frank
Oschmiansky (Ger) having the best result with a 39.544 in a 12-9-6-3-2-2
as France. After this round, Frank also took the Yellow shirt, but he
wouldn't play on Sunday... Alternatively some players went out to enjoy
the pubs and discos of Darmstadt though it certainly was fewer players
than we expected. Anyway those that were out came back happy and had lots
of fun.
<i>((Oh sure, I've got it now, FRANK is a PARTY POOPER!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  Sunday - To win or not to win..

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That was the question for around 10 to 15 players who still had a fair
shot at the win without a Solo. And it showed that this round saw once
more lots of hard fought games with just one very high result from Simon
Bouton playing England in a 15-9-7-3 draw boosting his score with another
49.183 points. It was clear beforehand that the winner would need at least
three very strong results above the 30 point mark, one of them having to
be above 40 points probably.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And so it happened that an American brought the European DipCon trophy
home:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Congrats to Edi Birsan for stabbing and duping the whole European hobby
with a whopping 120 points overall but congrats as well to Gihan
Bandaranaike (UK-111p) and Demis Hassabis (UK-100p) who came in second and
third. After those on places 4 to 7 four Germans made it into the Top
Seven, playing the role of good hosts "giving" the trophies to our
guests:-) For all the other awards/ranking details (Best Countries etc.)
please see below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Summary

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wow, four days saw 79 players duelling on all together 41 boards. As we
heard and felt during the tourney, they all had a very good time enjoying
the games and the atmosphere. We hope that everybody left Germany with a
good feeling and the intention to come back next year or at least in 2006
for the WDC in Berlin. We'd like to thank all our German and foreign
guests once more for attending and spreading that nice atmosphere we had
throughout the weekend. As well we'd like to thank all those kind souls
who helped us before, during and after the tournament. We, the organizers,
and the whole German hobby certainly look forward to meet you all again
over here as soon as possible. And of course we will also try to visit
your respective Cons in your home countries. For those that couldn't
attend: Just get in contact with someone who was there and let you tell
what you missed;-) C U All at least in Berlin 2006 for WDC!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ok, another MLB regular season has come and gone.  Shall we look at the 
results?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  Let's see...Yankees, Red Sox, Orioles, Blue Jays, Dev...HEY!!! 
Wait a minute!!! Tampa Bay finished ahead of Toronto!!!!  This is the 
first change in the standings since 1998!  Lou Piniella for Manager of the 
Year!!!  Ok, so they went 26-49 against the division.  That's still 17 
wins better than I thought they would do

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  If you take out the Central and Interleague the Twins are 
35-33.  That's pretty good for a small market team.  Props to them.  No 
one else in the division did .500 that way.  Note also that the Tigers 
finished 72-90, winning 29 more games than last year.  The problem with 
that of course is the raised expectations, and when the Tigers have the 
same record next year Trammell will be canned.  Too bad.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  Anaheim survived their injuries.  Had Oakland had the same 
number of injuries the division wouldn't have been close, as they still 
don't have the money to make it up.  By all rights, the A's should be the 
division winner.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Will whomever was supposed to have put the stake in the Braves' 
hearts please check your work?  13 division titles and counting.  Convince 
me they can't do it again next year.  Go ahead.  What IS the Mets' 
problem?  This team looks more and more like the Orioles every year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Ok, we've played 162 games, and I'm still waiting for the 
Cardinals' starting pitching to look like it's supposed to.  Did Bob 
Gibson get back in uniform through a time warp?  The Astros went 36-10 
over the last 7 weeks to catch and pass the Cubs for the Wild Card. That's 
scary on two levels:  first, because they could really be the best team in 
the NL playoffs.  Second, because the scenario is eerily reminiscent of 
1969, when the Mets went 41-9 to catch and pass the Cubs, then win the WS. 
 And speaking of the Cubs, they found a new way to frustrate their fans 
this year.  But be advised:  Cubs fans are a resiliant lot.  It took 30 
hours after the Cubs were eliminated for them to finish mourning, then 
they began preparations for the 2005 Cubs' World Series victory parade. 
Note that they're also planning a protest of Cubs' management the day 
after that parade to make sure that Sammy Sosa's 2006 option is picked up, 
so it's not like we're dealing with rational people here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  I keep making predictions a year too soon.  I picked the Dodgers 
to win the West last year, but this year I figured they were destined to 
be the same underachievers that the Orioles have been.  I'm still waiting 
for their hitting to look like Dodgers' hitting.  Maybe in the playoffs. 
In retrospect, it's just as well that the Cubs didn't make the postseason, 
as a 7-game NLCS between them and LA might not score 20 runs.  Not good 
TV.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Angels over Red Sox in 4, Yankees over Twins in 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  St. Louis over Los Angeles in 5, Astros over Braves in 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Yankees over Angels in 7 (which is what I predicted pre-season).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Houston over St. Louis in 6 (substitute the Cubs in for the 
Cardinals and that's what I predicted pre-season).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Yankees over the former Yankees in 6, as Clemens can't pitch every 
game for the Astros.  Where's Andy Pettitte when they need him?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As the Cubs' fans say, "Wait 'til next year!".  As Pedro would say, "who's 
your daddy?".
<i>((I know I'm useless, but I don't get the reference here, though I can
gather the jist.  
Plus, Pedro was TOYING with the media.  Believe it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East - Interesting note: Orioles were deciding factor in the race.  They won
the season's series against the Sox and were simply atrocious against
the Yankees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central (on the Tigers improving to 72-90) -
So, Pudge's agent can say he's worth 29 wins?  :)
Tigers' pitching is starting to improve, esp. Bonderman.  Twins have
a real ace worth watching.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West - A's had plenty of chances to put this division away and didn't.  They
failed because their starting pitching failed; it's that simple. 
Nobody's saying "Mulder for Cy Young" anymore, eh?
<i>((I think it is clear that Santana wins the AL Cy Young going away....))</i>
Should be interesting to see what happens with Zito.  O's want him
badly.  Now that Angelos has lost fight with DC expect him to try to
bring in a top starter to go along with Tejada and the boys.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East - If I were to go to Atlanta next Spring, I would suddenly rediscover
my fastball and would win 24 games.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central (Cards starting pitching) - It does.  It's not supposed to be very good.  
:)  Seriously, they have a LOT of middling pitchers.  The starting pitching isn't going
to get them to the World Series.  If they pull that off, it will
because of Messrs. Pujols, Edmonds, Rolen, et al.
I'm not going to think about the fact that Jeff Suppan had a better
season than Derek Lowe or Tim Wakefield.
<i>((We may remember that the Red Sox picked up Suppan last year and then
dumped him when he was disappointing down the stretch.
And Goz thinks Gibson returned?))</i>
Gibson never had an ERA so high, did he?  
<i>((No, we recall when Gibson had the season with the ERA of 1.12, 
that's when they got scared offense was going to disappear and they
lowered the pitching mound.  
It might be time to reverse that change....))</i>
Astros have good hitting, a couple aces and a decent bullpen.  Could
be scary.  
I remember a couple weeks ago when the Cubs blew a game on national
TV with a 3-0 lead going into the 9th.  Problem?  They brought in
LaTroy Hawkins to close.  That's just not good enough.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West - Best thing about Dodgers was how I picked up Adrian Beltre in April
off the Free Agent list in the Piggy Backers fantasy league.  (BTW,
if anybody wants to take over "Kid Theo's Sluggers" the team needs a
new owner.  It's got Beltre, Soriano, Edmonds, Berkman, Thome,
Hudson, Gagne, Escobar, and Tomko.  It's a keeper league with the
option of keeping 3-5 players.  I made it to the league finals before
Escobar and Tomko reverted to form.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Bzzt.  Wrong on both counts.  
Sox over Angels in 4, Twins over Yankees in 5.  Santana pitches two
shutouts.  Sox/Angels series could feature some series hitting.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  Cardinals over Dodgers in 4, Astros over Braves in 3.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Sox over Twins in 6.  Santana wins twice.  Sox clobber the rest of
the staff.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Astros over Cardinals in 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Don't forget Roy Oswalt!  
Sox over Astros in 7 when Schilling beats Clemens AT FENWAY!  (AL has
home field in World Series).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Awards:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL MVP: Guerrero in squeaker over Ramirez.  NY media is baffled that
they didn't get to simply annoing Sheffield.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Cy Young: Santana.  (Duh.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL MVP: Bonds.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Cy Young:  Clemens.  (*cringe*)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On the A's collapse))</i>: 
Had the Angels been healthy all year the AL West would not have been 
close.  That the A's were in it at all should be applauded, but Anaheim 
had enough in the bank for replacement players when the regulars went 
down.  This is where the money discrepency rears its head more than 
anywhere.  The lesser-moneyed teams can sometimes (if they're smart like 
the A's, or in a real bad division like the Twins) put a team good enough 
to compete on the field...until they get an injury.  The actuarial tables 
say that they'll have one...or two...or three...or more.  It's harder for 
Oakland to make a replacement than Anaheim.  This is where Jim-Bob's 
theories of baseball fail.  You can point out all year how much better 
the, say, Red Sox starting infielders are than the Yankees.  But you have 
to factor in the second stringers too, as they play a lot of innings, both 
regular season and playoffs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On Zito and the O's))</i>:
Assuming that DC actually gets the team (and from what I hear that's 50-50 
at best with all that has to happen) will Angelos actually put money into 
his?  First, he wants to sell, and a prospective buyer is going to want 
the salary structure that the O's have in place...i.e., front-loaded, so 
the team will be cheap to run in the future.  Second, if he holds onto it 
he's guaranteed $$$ out of MLB, so why bother putting a decent product on 
the field?  I have to turn to you for the answer to that question, as we 
don't get that kind of info in Chicago.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On the Cubs blowing saves))</i>:
As of last I knew (which I think was last Thursday), the Cubs had blown 25 
save opportunities during the year.  The one guy they never replaced (not 
for lack of trying) was the injured Joe Boroski.  Not that he's going to 
make anyone forget Rivera or Gagne, but he was the best the Cubs had 
starting the season.  I've lost track of him in the last few months, and 
don't remember if he's coming back (or even what his injury was...seems 
like it was end of May when it happened).  It'll be a big puzzle piece to 
fill for the Cubs off-season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On Sox winning with Schilling over Clemens in WS Game 7))</i>:
Red Sox fans are an interesting bunch.  The above statement would have 
more validity if I wasn't aware of the fact that, had they NOT made the 
playoffs, you'd still be predicting they win the WS (this is where Cubs' 
fans diverge...they'll mourn for a day after they're eliminated and then 
prepare the victory parade for the next year...Red Sox fans are still 
telling me how they're going to beat the Yankees LAST year).  But I don't 
see the end of the world coming, so I'm pretty sure you're wrong here.  If 
not, I'll tip my cap to you too, and call you my daddy.  Jim-Bob won't 
mind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Rick commenting on Expos chances of ending up in DC))</i>:
I think it's more than that.  But I've been out of DC for 10 days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And on what Angelos will do))</i>:
Before this past season, I would have pegged Angelos as a skinflint
of the Loria/Pohlad mold, quite willing to bitch and moan and use the
team for what he wanted without trying to field a winner.  But the
previous offseason, he went out and got Miguel Tejada, Javy Lopez,
and Rafiel Palmeiro, as well as bringing back Sidney Ponson.
Tejada has been terrific and Lopez has been pretty good, too.  I
think Angelos' ego is too big to not want to field a winner.  Their
problem this past season was a real lack of starting pitching.  But
they've got enough hitting to be competitive, if they were to add
Zito and maybe one more pitcher.  Their young pitchers have been
developing steadily.  Unfortunately for the O's, "competitive" won't
achieve much in their division - it takes more than 95 wins to even
register on the radar.  
<i>((And I do agree that is the problem in the AL East with the 
Red Sox and the Yankees there, that I do agree is a problem that you
don't want to solve with more Wild Cards, I don't think.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Rick's comeback on Red Sox fans))</i>:
I'm not <b>that much</b> of a homer.  But the Sox did have a better team
than the Yankees last year.  They just had the wrong manager.  I'm
not sold on Francona, BTW.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'll let Rick take all the credit.... the Red Sox will benefit
from the WS home field advantage WHEN they get there, but only
as long as New England doesn't go into a deep freeze.  We've been
cool and will get cooler.  Those night games are going to be COLD!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And on picking up for injuries as a big difference between
big spending and small spending teams, I don't disagree, but
the Red Sox had an amazing bench, though the 
Yankees didn't and don't.  This is the primary advantage for the
Red Sox over the Yankees this year, I think.  You keep giving my
theories a level of precision that they don't have.  I say, and
I will say again if the Red Sox don't win the WS and (say) the
Twins do, that in the playoffs the record is clear, it is TEAMS
that win the WS.  The Yankees haven't won it since they lost 
their "team guys" of Brosius and O'Neill.  There are lots of
guys like that on other teams than the Red Sox and Yankees.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Of the teams in the playoffs, to me, the REAL teams that have a
shot of winning are (other than the Red Sox, which seem to have
the Party Central crazy team this year) the Twins, the Angels,
the Astros, and MAYBE the Cardinals (though I think the Cards
have had it).  Your favorite Dodgers and Braves ;-) have no
chance and are just playing to see who doesn't get to the WS.
I also think the Twins likely will beat the Yankees this time.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On the Expos to DC,
are you thinking that the announcement is just window dressing??
DC will get it, everyone but Angelos wants them to get it, and they
would have a huge public relations disaster if they DON'T get it
after announcing it.   I'd be interested in Rick's take on it,
but the O's probably LOST value overnight when the announcement was
made, so why would Angelos sell now?  After the team comes in and
it STINKS for a while, then the O's will show that they still have
value (as I believe they do).))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And finally, on the Red Sox and the Astros in the playoffs, 
I think Rick's scenario is VERY, VERY, VERY plausible.  I think 
that's where we're headed.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Tue, 5 Oct 2004 09:43:09 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On the Expos to DC deal))</i>:
Bear in mind it has already been a PR disaster, as this should have been 
done months ago (maybe years ago).  I think the announcement was actually 
rushed as it stands.  The DC Buds (I think this name will stick...it has 
built-in sponsorship possibilities) still need a stadium, a parking lot, a 
concession stand, someone to manage the concession stand, someone to 
manage whoever manages the concession stand, a few local ordanaces 
overturned (if it's in the city of DC itself this won't be hard, as there 
are enough politicians on the take there), a traffic flow study, 
environmental impact statement, a fan base, tickets printed, etc.  It 
looks like a real good program management job for whoever wins "Apprentice 
2", assuming that Trump buys the team (oh, don't they need an owner 
besides MLB too?).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But right now Angelos could sell, and he's got a guarantee from MLB of the 
selling price.  So if it's now or 2008 he gets the same.  It seems like 
that's a non-issue.  So to answer your question, 'yes', I do think it's 
just window dressing.  I don't think Angelos is the roadblock anymore, 
it's logistics.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Am I missing something here?  As I said, this news doesn't always filter 
out this way, so I could be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Now Goz makes perfectly reasonable fun of the Red Sox fans))</i>:
I think it's plausible that I could win the lottery too.  Just the same, 
I'm keeping the 401K.  I still think it's unfair that you're not a betting 
man, as I could have retired to a nice sunny beach by now (25 freakin'

The deal requires a vote by the city to build a new park, and
says that they will play at least 3 seasons at RFK so that
they can go ahead with the move now.  I'd say it's pretty 
certain to happen at this point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course who will own the team is an interesting question.
And will they have deep enough pockets to really compete? (&lt;:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not really a follower of baseball, but my take on it is
that it's certainly the case that you can buy your way into
the playoffs (nothing's guaranteed of course, but it comes close)
but to win it all takes a team mentality as Jim said, and it's
harder to buy that.  What I really want to know is how much does
it cost to get a curse removed (&lt;:.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think that looking at the NFL shows the remarkable success of
a well done cap strategy.  The players aren't hurting, the owners
aren't hurting and parity really is a reality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sox win it all because they never have to play the Yankees so
Pedro's daddy won't be there to make him nervous.  Clemens wins
his game though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It occurred to me, after watching the Twins and Astros lose their
respective Games Four, that managers should Really Learn that
pitchers who are aces with four days rest are not aces with three
days rest.  The only advantage the Twins had over the Yankees was
Santana:  pitching him with 3 days rest watered down that advantage. 
Still, the real problem was the bullpen.  Few things I hate more than
watching a struggling reliever facing a batter who is a GREAT mistake
hitter, and failing, and thus losing a relatively large lead.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Q2:  Nope.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
t-shirts...: Don't bother.  The Braves are not very strong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Q3:  I'm West of Philadelphia.  I care.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cubs payroll:
The Cubs can afford it.  The Cubs play in the third largest city in
the US, they have a sweet cable TV deal, and have a fairly wealthy
fan base.  Their cheap ownership has been the main problem for years.
 Their problems this year were more injury-related than fundamental. 
Presuming Wood and Prior make comebacks next year, they should be
considered one of the favorites.

Braves: They were strong enough to get to Game 5 of the NLDS.  That oughta count 
for something.  They got within 9 games of winning the World Series.  That 
puts them ahead of all but 4 teams.  So if they're not very strong, 
there's a real imbalance in baseball.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Q3: Ok, fine.  So other than transplanted New Yorkers and New Englanders...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cubs payroll: Can baseball afford it?  If there's 6 teams over $110M and 6 teams below 
$55M can baseball afford it?  Granted, the Cubs probably could afford it, 
but the White Sox, who tend to draw only anti-Cubs' fans, could not.  So 
if we're going to say that the only teams that are allowed to win are from 
this set of, say, 12 or so, why bother having the Pirates, Royals, White 
Sox, etc.?
I've said before that money doesn't always equal success, but lack of 
money almost always equals failure.  I still think that MLB should 
contract any team who isn't serious.  Let's define that as not having won 
a World Series in the last 60 years.  That'll cut down 11 right there...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Good idea, save us Sox fans all that agony.  We're serious, but shouldn't be.
In a radical change, the Sox announce that their starting lineup for all
games of the series with the Yankees will be Martinez, Arroyo, Shilling.
Each will pitch 3 innings and then stop before they get tired.  If it works
out, they are considering getting rid of all the closers and any other 
pitcher who's making more than the average grocery store clerk and can't 
pitch more than an inning or two.  Cutting the pitching staff from 28 to
5 should trim the payroll considerably....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Braves are built for the regular season, and that's been their
problem for most of the past decade.  They've always had great depth
in their starting rotation, a decent bullpen, and reasonable hitting,
but, at least since Glavine and Maddux started declining, they have
not had respectable aces.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The current formula for postseason success is:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 - at least two aces pitching (one of whom could simply be a talented
pitcher pitching over his head, like Beckett or Wakefield last
October).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 - a stacked bullpen

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 - good fielding

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 - clutch hitting

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Braves have most of that, but not all.  
And yeah, there is real imbalance in baseball.  But the 13-time
repeat champions of their divisions are not a case study in that
problem.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I entirely agree.....
On two aces, yes, the Red Sox may well have three if Arroyo keeps pitching as
he has, which will lead to them killing the Cardinals too.  I
don't think at this point that Houston will make it, but they
CAN.  Only the Red Sox REALLY have this among the remaining teams,
perhaps the Astros do.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The stacked bullpen is really important.  The games are won in the 6-8 innings,
doesn't matter so much if you have a lights out closer, the
stacking is most important.  Lately, all four of the teams
left have been exhibiting this in reasonably similar proportions.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((On fielding, the Red Sox changes are most important here, strangely enough.
You need to not beat yourself.  Pretty much all of the first
round series to one extent or another were given away.  I
paid most attention to Anaheim's giveaways, but they all did it.
The Yankees are MOST likely to give away something in the next round,
which is NOT good for them.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And clutch hitting is what will make the two series exciting!  All four teams
have this big time.  Expect to see some amazing clutch hitting.
The Braves especially did not have the clutch hitting of the Astros.
Last night's game was REALLY obvious on this score.  The Astros
themselves blew it in a couple of places too.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((On imbalance, I agree with this, the problem is the lower level teams taking
the money and running.  On a % of budget basis the Yankees and
Red Sox and Braves are NOT the biggest profit money makers.
They spend and put resources back in.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Q3:  :)
Seriously, that's a LOT of people you're talking about.  The Sox draw
considerable numbers of fans as a visiting team, even in Anaheim in a
playoff game!  As for the Yankees, the baseball hat that you'll see
most often in Europe has `NY' on it.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Baseball <i>should</i> restructure itself, in the interests of retaining
competitive balance.  It won't do that anytime in the near future.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Answer to why bother to have bottom market teams:))</i>
So people like Beltran have somewhere to play before they join the
Yankees?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Eliminate everyone who hasn't won a WS in the last 60 years:))</i>
The Diamondbacks are more serious than the Red Sox?  Pshaw!

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Tue, 12 Oct 2004 10:11:14 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cuts out the Red Sox, Devil Rays, White Sox, Mariners, Rangers (who may 
stay on a technicality...the Senators won a WS somewhere in that time 
frame), Expos, Cubs, Brewers, Astros, Padres, Rockies.  No great loss.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Dave's 3 innings per pitching idea from above:))</i>
A friend of mine suggested this 30 years ago.  From what I know of what 
they do with starting pitchers (which isn't really all that much) and 
their workouts, you could probably do it with 2 sets of 3, and have them 
pitch every other game.  Think someone could get 40 wins this way?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Not the starting pitcher.... I wonder how much that stops anyone
from trying it?
Goz continually gets hung up on the Braves, probably because
they are ubiquitous on a cable channel that I don't get.
I think that the Braves and the Yankees are starting to fall
into the same hole, perennial playoff spots, but no World Series
appearances or titles.  Obviously the Braves are there
entirely.  The Yankees are almost there.  And we'll see if the
Red Sox destroy them in this series, in which case they'll be
there too.  Goz gets equally distracted with me by claiming that
it is NOT a fair system if the Braves and Yankees are two of
the eight postseason teams every damned year.  It also is true
that you cannot form a coalition of teams to change this.
I accept the reality and move on....))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Hmm, interesting, what chance is there that Beltran DOESN'T move to
the Yankees in the off-season?  And if he does, will the Yankees
play appreciably better next season??  Those are worthwhile 
questions......
Oh yeah, and serious is not results, serious is effort.  And money is only
one part of effort.  But we don't ever sway you on that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 12 Oct 2004 15:37:58 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Yankees want Beltran to take over from Bernie.  Few teams can
compete with the Yankees on any given contract: the Braves, Red Sox,
Cubs, Dodgers, Angels, Orioles, Mets, Cardinals, Rangers, and Astros
might have the money to do so.  The Braves have Andruw Jones, the
Cardinals have Jim Edmonds, the Sox and Angels have stacked
outfields, and the Rangers just ditched ARod's contract, so I don't
see them replacing that burden with a new one.  The only teams I see
with the NY teams competing are LA and the Orioles.  But I think it's
considerably more than likely that he'll go to NY.  And probably to
the Yankees, not the Mets.  (The Mets have to give up on their recent
"Instant Rebuilding" strategy and start from scratch again.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Will the Yankees be a better team?  Beltran has never struck me to be
a great clutch hitter.  He doesn't make me fearful the way the
old-time Yankees have done.  The problem is that the Yankees are
becoming a bit of a Roto super-team, as opposed to a good team at
winning big games.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Yankees' real problem right now is their starting pitching. 
Mussina, Brown, Lieber, and El Duque are all on their decline, and
Vazquez just doesn't have the nerve to be a big-time Yankee pitcher. 
They need a number of younger arms (and Loaiza is not the answer). 
Even the magical Mariano Rivera is not as unhittable as he used to
be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't think the Yankees will reach the heights of their 1998-2000
accomplishments until they get an entirely new generation of players,
at least pitching.  Jeter may still be around when this happens, but
pretty none of the other current Yankees will be.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Except, of course, Ruben Sierra.  :)

Damn, is Tim McCarver stupid!!
While Curt Schilling, obviously not in top form, is getting beaten
around to the tune of six runs in three innings, McCarver:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 a) implies that bringing in a relief pitcher is equivalent to "giving
up on the game"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
and

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 b) later, since Schilling has been taken out early, he'll be able to
come back for Game 4, if necessary.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WTF????
Regarding (a), I really think Francona should have yanked Schilling
long before the game became completely out of hand.  Did we really
need to see Matsui clear the bases in the 3rd to know that something
was wrong??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Regarding (b), why would an injured Schilling be preferable to a
healthy starter?

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Bad luck with Schilling.  Good job by the Sox making a game of it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hey Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I started writing a preview for the A's in 05, either for <i>TAP</i> or 
<i>Benzene</i> or both, I hadn't really decided yet.  It got way too long and 
rambling, so I threw it all out and maybe I'll try it again with 
something shorter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, along the way I remembered something I wanted to tell you about 
the Ramon Hernandez trade we discussed here last year. Since then I've 
learned a bit about how it came about. It was Padres GM Kevin Towers 
who initiated it. Mark Kotsay was one of those players like Erubiel 
Durazo whom Billy Beane had been chasing after for a while. He had 
tried to draft him out of college and he had tried to get him in trade 
when Florida was dismantling their championship team a few years back. 
Everyone in the business knew that Beane wanted Kotsay, including Kevin 
Towers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After the 2003 season, Towers got it in his head that he wanted to get 
Ramon Hernandez. Of course, Hernandez was a star then, and Towers knew 
Beane wouldn't give him up easily, so he started right out by offering 
up Kotsay. That got Billy's attention and they negotiated a deal around 
that. So it's not that Billy Beane made a point of putting Hernandez 
out as bait knowing that he was overvalued, it's just that when an 
opportunity came along to trade him up for something even better, he 
took it.
<i>((OK, that makes even a bit more sense.  
Matches what happened really well.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Maybe I'll try again some time with the A's preview. Short version: 
Redman will go; other starters will stay (for 05, anyway). Bullpen will 
be completely rearranged, as usual.  Dye will definitely move. He'll 
have a good season elsewhere, which will make the budget-ignorant fans 
all wonder aloud why he was let go. Chavez, Crosby, Hatteberg, Kotsay 
will stay. Durazo probable, Byrnes maybe, Miller doubtful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ok, there's WAAY too much from last night to respond to today, so it'll 
have to wait, but a couple of points...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I didn't say it explicitly, but I'd always been betting on Pedro
to be the one to win the game to take Boston back home 1-1, which
is all you really need in a 7 game series.  I'm annoyed a bit 
more than Rick at Tim McCarver, so I finally turned him off to
listen to Joe and Jerry, our radio guys.  Also, interestingly,
the Yankees scored all their runs while my wife Charlotte was
watching and the Red Sox scored all their runs while she wasn't.
I'm not sure if I'm letting her watch any more, luckily we will
be at choir practice for the first three innings of tonight's
game, so the Red Sox should come out to an early lead before
we tune in.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1.  The media here say that the only two bidders on Beltran will be the 
Cubs and the Yankees.  Draw your own conclusions...I actually don't have 
any on that one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree that the Cubs will be under huge pressure to join the Red
Sox has the other high payroll team chasing (or more properly NOT
chasing) the Yankees.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2.  As is usual, Jim-Bob takes half a point and runs the wrong way with 
it.  I attribute this to the fact that he's convinced that the Red Sox 
have been the best team in baseball every year since 1919 (maybe before 
too), and the fact that the Yankees have 26 WS titles since then doesn't 
even register with him.  But if a team only has $55M to spend on players, 
does it really matter if they spend $55M or $35M?  Some teams (Florida, 
San Diego...) are actually dumping salaries after a good year to save up 
for a run in 4-5 years.  Sometimes it works.  Then they have to dump 
again.  Let me put the spin another way:  you never see the Red Sox (Evil 
Empire #2) doing that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Sigh, I don't think so, I think that's what you're doing.  I'm NOT 
talking about the pre-Steinbrenner era at all.  In my childhood years,
I had to deal with the Yankees as champions, my mother as a huge
Yankees fan (she still is) and then the Yankees went in the toilet
in the late 60's (I always think of Horace Clarke as emblematic of
the bad players of that era).  But, after Steinbrenner came in,
you had waves of periods when the Boss allowed someone else to build
real teams, and he won WS's; and then other periods when the Boss
tried to buy WS and they didn't.  I'm asserting they are in one
of those periods now and won't win the WS this year.  If they do,
you will be WELL justified in laughing at me about it.  I have
had and continue to have all the respect in the world for the 
O'Neill, Brosius led teams that won WS's before this team.
That team was REALLY hard to dislike, really!  But the smaller
teams, DO have to use ALL their resources (not taking</i> $<i>20 million
of their resources out for profits) to try to win.  Some do,
and those I praise and they occasionally win WS, and some don't.
And some I think MIGHT be doing it (e.g. the Brewers) but turns
out they're really not.  IF all the teams actively played with
as much intensity off the field as the A's, Reds, Padres, Rangers,
etc. (all teams that don't have a huge amount of resources) the
game as a whole would be MUCH better.  You would still have the
Yankees and Braves as two of the teams in the playoffs every year,
and it is frustrating for the DRays, Orioles, and BJays that they
have two perennial playoff challengers in their division, but
that's the way it is.  Accept it and move on, urge on the teams
that aren't trying.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3.  Why is it, with no pitches yet fired in anger in the NLCS, no one 
thinks that Houston stands a chance?  The Cards will get their runs, the 
Astros will have to match them, what does it matter which pitcher they get 
them off of?  It's not like Clemens and Oswalt won't be on the roster for 
this series.  Oh, sorry, you guys aren't paying attention to this one...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Not me, I'm paying lots of attention and I've said from the beginning
of the playoffs that Cards or Astros, both have a good chance.  They
still do.  It will go 6-7 games and also be really exciting.  I 
intend to pay lots of attention to it.  I like both teams somewhat
on some levels and not on other levels.  I'm not ROOTING for one 
or the other.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4.  If the Red Sox somehow manage to win the World Series, they will NOT 
be considered "Underdogs who shocked the world".  Deal with it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((OK, I certainly agree with that.  But if they do, they will beat
the Yankees who've spent (even with the obscenely high RS payroll)
50% more than them.  That makes them something of an underdog.
But it won't be like a Marlins, Angels, or Diamondbacks 
victory, agreed.))</i>

The strange thing about the Sox' current predicament is that this is
the first time since 1978 I can think of where they've been the
victim of simple bad luck.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Looking back:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 2003: Last year the problem was managerial incompetence.  Still, what
was up with Wakefield being unhittable last year?  Freakish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1999: Yankees were simply better.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1995: Indians were much better.  Clemens failing as team ace.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1988, 1990: As were better.  Clemens getting beaten by Stewart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1986: Bullpen was Sox' vulnerability, and we all knew it.  Mets were
a more complete team.  Only Bruce Hurst pitching the best baseball of
his life made this series go 7 games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1978: before this year, this was the best Sox team I'd ever seen. 
Problem was they were stuck with Torrez in the playoff game because
the race was so tight they could not use Eck or Tiant.  But I'd have
to say I didn't expect Bucky Dent to beat us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 1975: a truly great World Series.  Somebody had to win, and Tiant
could only pitch so many times.  This Reds team was one of the best
teams ever and should have been favored to win.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Really, this is the first time I can think of where a major injury to
an irreplaceable player has hit the Sox.  Sox are not out of it, but
being 0-2 with Schilling most likely done leaves them in a bad spot. 
Mostly, they need to start hitting better.  Certainly Arroyo can
pitch well enough to win Game 3.  And Pedro can pitch well enough to
win his next start.  But Wakefield and/or Lowe are going to have to
seriously step up from where they pitched in September, AND the Sox
bats need to get going.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It <i>can</i> happen.  But the Yankees should be favored at this point.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
:(
Sad thing is that all season, we've been talking about how THIS IS
THE  YEAR, largely because they won't be able to keep this team
together.  The Sox are not going to pay Pedro ace money at this stage
(though they should think seriously about doing that), and Lowe is
definitely gone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As a social experiment (which could be done on a lot of sports' fans), I'm 
conducting a poll in the wake of a baseball game which ended well after 
the school children interested in it should have gone to bed (but probably 
didn't):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What is the mood of Red Sox Nation currently?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I ask this in the wake of both of last year's LCS, where I was actually 
worried that you guys had all jumped off a bridge (with 1 million of your 
closest friends) after Game 7 of the ALCS, and most all of the Cubs' fans 
(?) jumped ship after the Bartman game, which was only Game 6 (Game 7 at 
Wrigley, but apparently no one thought it was anything other than a 
coronation of the Marlins' NL championship).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Dave Partridge (Mon, 18 Oct 2004 07:38:31 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, first of all I'm not sure I really qualify as a member of
Red Sox nation because I'm not really a follower of baseball,
and while I root for the Sox when I have to choose, I'm certainly
not a dedicated fan.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That being said, my mood is fairly unaffected.  I was a bit 
pumped after the sweep, it was a grand time to be a Boston
sports fan, but after the first two games I'd lost that boost
and the 3rd one just put a cap on it.  Didn't even bother
staying up to see the end of last night after they failed
to close it out in the 9th.  I'll be pumped again if we
pull if off, but I'm not expecting any miracles.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I stayed up to the joyous bitter end.... it ain't over
until it's over.... but I too am not expecting miracles.
My mood is mostly affected from lack of sleep right now....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Mon, 18 Oct 2004 08:58:47 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My mood could be described as "crazed".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Look - if you wanted the greatest comeback of all time, the script is
ready for it.  The Sox were down to the 9th inning, down 3 games to
0, down 4-3, with Mariano Rivera pitching and the 7-8-9 hitters due
up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It could not possibly be bleaker!  And then they tie and go into
extra innings, and win in the 12th.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So I figure today the Sox bats are going to crush Mussina (who never
pitches well twice in a row...an instant stat I made up that doesn't
contradict any vague recollections) and Pedro will win easily.  (He
has been pitching well, after all.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then for game 6, we'll see Schilling has amputated his troublesome
foot, and is pitching off a peg leg, which gives increased support. 
He pitches a complete game shutout, and the Sox win 1-0.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That brings up game 7, at which point the Yankees are quaking in
their boots for fear of what Steinbrenner and the fans will do if
they collapse worse than the Sox have EVER collapsed (the Sox, after
all, have never blown a 3-0 series lead - nobody in baseball has!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can't see this game clearly, but I know the Sox will win to set up
a Sox/Astros Series, with Kerry rooting on the Sox at Fenway while W.
roots for them in Texas.  The entire focus of the nation comes down
upon the World Series, Red vs. Blue, AL vs. NL, Good vs. Clemens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sadly for the Astros, the Rapture strikes during game 7, as Johnny
Damon reveals "Duh, I'm Jesus already!", leading the Saved into
heaven and leaving the Astros with only 3 players left on the field. 
The Sox minus Damon (not many born-again in Boston) win easily as the
Earth cracks open and swallows up the sinners.

Delusional?  Ha!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Forecast calls for rain today in NY.  I'm trying to decide who needs
a day off more: the Sox or the Yankees.  Though the Yankee bullpen is
reeling, I think the Sox could use an extra day to have a viable
insurance plan (other than, ugh, Ramiro Mendoza) in case Schilling
cannot pitch.  I think with an extra day, Arroyo would be a viable
backup plan, with Lowe saved for Game 7 and Wakefield to plug any
gaps.  (Pedro is the only pitcher who I think is definitely done for
the series.)  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If Schilling can pitch his game, I favor him over Lieber.  If not,
the Sox will have to do some serious scrambling.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I continue to be amazed that the Twins cut David Ortiz.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Say what you will about the ways the system is broken (and it is),
it has certainly succeeded in producing a great playoff series
this year.  Never did get to see any of the NLCS game, it started
two hours after the ALCS one and finished first!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Answering Rick on Schilling...))</i>
Ayup.  If Schilling is on I think there's a very good change of game
7.  If not, all we can hope is that Lieber doesn't pitch like he did
the last time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On Ortiz))</i>:
How did he do for the Twins?  Sometimes the change of venue is 
what's needed.  The Bengals were right to get rid of Corey Dillon,
even though he's been a great asset to the Patriots.  He wasn't
a great asset to Cincinnati.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, that's about right, he was only a part time player in
Minnesota.
He was OK, but he wasn't what he is now.
Still, I agree with Rick, they shouldn't have cut him given what the
Red Sox were able to sign him for that first time.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Yankees could have tried to re-sign Clemens.  They didn't.  The
way Clemens left Boston was much worse: he had a secret, illegal deal
in place with the ownership in Toronto that let him move to the
Yankees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Plus, Clemens dogged it for many years on the Sox in the 1980s.  He
became a better pitcher after leaving for Toronto.

Don't count out the Astros so quickly.  Consider the starting
pitchers tonight:  Roger Clemens vs. Jeff Suppan.  (Both former Red
Sox, BTW).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Astros have good hitting, but I think the Cards are slightly better
(but the Yankees lineup was not weak, nor the Angels for that
matter).  I think the Astros have better pitching, but the Cards have
more pitching.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I haven't decided what I want: the rematch of 1946 and 1967 with the
Cards, or the Sox/Astros matchup which would neatly parallel the
Presidential race.

<i>((I think that Rick still has it right, at least
partly.  Schilling will pitch games 2 and 6 so 
he doesn't have to bat.  But Roger Clemens will

Looks like we might have Lowe in 3, 7 against Clemens.
I can't recall, weren't Lowe and Clemens teammates for

this week in RHODE ISLAND (where there are LOTS of Yankee fans)
I heard that just about everyone in many of the schools had 
pledged their allegiance with an appropriate Yankee or Red
Sox wearable item.  I'm not sure if the Yankees people were
still wearing those today or not.  The really hot and popular
Red Sox items include wearing socks with pomegranate stains
to simulate Curt's blood or slightly more commercially
generated t-shirts of #38 Bloody Brilliant which have an
image of a blood stained sock, RemDawg (broadcaster and former
second baseman Jerry Remy) signed scorecards of key games
that generate a donation to the Jimmy Fund and hats, and  
the Carl Stevens audio reading of the poem "The Idiot Red Sox
Will Rise!!!".  This doesn't come close to the fanaticism
over the Dropkick Murphys resurrecting the 1903 Broadway hit
and Red Sox fight song "Tessie" and updating as the new official
fight song.  I must be embarrassed to say that Don Williams
had to tell me about this particular element of the Red Sox
nation social fabric.  I'm a Joe and Jerry radio guy and they
are a bit less non-traditional, though at the end of the game
last night Joe Castiglione declared that this was the greatest
series in sports history, and he doesn't always... well not 
often, go that overboard in hyperbole.  But Peter Gammons
said something similar.  How's that for the mood of Red

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Very time constrained today, but let me get out what I can...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, congrats to the Red Sox on several historic events, most notably 
(lest we forget), their first WS appearance since 1986 (side note:  my 
cubie noted before game 6 that the last time the Red Sox depended on a 
player in high tops, his name was, "Bill Buckner"...thought it best not to 
forward that one on then).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Second, let's remember that there's another good series going on, with 
Game 7 tonight.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Third, the way I work it out, if Houston wins and the WS goes to 7, then 
Rick's formula of Clemens pitching game 7 in Fenway works out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fourth, I think it was Dave who suggested yesterday that the playoffs have 
been much better lately (or maybe just this year) then before.  This makes 
sense from a financial standpoint, as the better players are concentrated 
on fewer teams, who tend to make the playoffs.  There are many more teams 
in the mold of, say, the mid-70s Reds or late-80s As.  I would also argue 
that it makes sense because my feeling is that players today are a lot 
better than they used to be, not even including steroids.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fifth, I would note that right now the score is still 26-0 since 1918, and 
the only thing that would change that and signal a curse removal is a WS 
victory.  If all you're shooting for is to beat the Yankees then you've 
beaten the best, but haven't set your goals high enough.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sixth, I would ask that if the Red Sox manage to win the WS that they wait 
until Game 7, which would be 31 October, since my son's 2nd birthday is 
the day before, and I'd like to see that before the rapture.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

www.baseball-reference.com 
is a neat website to play with while one is sitting around, waiting
to see WHO WILL PLAY THE RED SOX IN THE WORLD SERIES.  (Excuse me, I
sometimes feel compelled to use CAPS.)  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I took a look at the 1986 Sox to see if anybody other than Clemens
was still around.  Do you remember how Tom Seaver was on that team? 
Though he was already 42 at the time and didn't make the postseason
roster, he was reportedly a big influence on young Clemens. 
Comparing the '86 Sox with the '04 Sox:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1B  Buckner/Stapleton vs. Millar/Mientkiewicz.  Keep in mind that
overall hitting numbers were lower in the 80s than these days. 
Buckner was towards the tail end of a great career.  Millar has more
pop in his bat, but Buckner did have 102 RBIs in 1986.  Advantage:
push.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2B  Marty Barrett vs. Bellhorn/Reese.  Barrett had a tremendous
postseason in '86, but overall he was a light-hitting 2nd baseman. 
Bellhorn brings a bit more power and draws more walks, but set a
franchise record for Ks.  Reese is lights out defensively.  Slight
advantage: 2004.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
SS  Spike Owen vs. Orlando Cabrera.  Both midseason pick-ups.  Owen
did not do much for the Sox, while Cabrera has really given the
defense a boost, as well as providing reasonable hitting.  Clear
advantage: 2004.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3B  Wade Boggs vs. Bill Mueller.  While Mueller won last year's
batting title, Boggs made a habit of picking up batting titles, and
hit for reasonable power.  In 1986, Boggs hit .357.  Clear advantage:
1986.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
C  Rich Gedman vs. Jason Varitek.  Gedman was a solid but
unspectacular catcher.  Varitek has a bit more pop in his bat, and
also provides great leadership.  Advantage: 2004

<div class="p"><!----></div>
LF Jim Rice vs. Manny Ramirez.  This is where we have to do the most
adjusting for eras.  If you only look at numbers, you will
underestimate Rice.  Having said that, 1986 was towards the tail end
of Rice's career, and he was starting to drop off a bit.  I would say
Rice in his prime would be comparable to Manny in his prime, but
Manny is still in his prime, and Rice was not in 1986.  Slight
advantage: 1986.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CF Tony Armas vs. Johnny Damon.  Armas was a serious slugging
outfielder up through 1984.  Unfortunately, by 1986, he was well into
his decline.  Damon is much more of a speedster, and definitely a
better fielder and runner and has reasonable power.  Clear advantage:
2004.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
RF Dwight Evans vs. Trot Nixon.  Evans is the best defensive RF in
Sox history.  Nixon is a decent fielder with a slight advantage in
hitting.  Advantage: push.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
DH Don Baylor vs. David Ortiz.  With all due respect to Baylor, this
is a clear advantage for Ortiz.  Baylor, like Rice and Armas, was a
bit past his prime in 1986, while Ortiz is a monster in his prime. 
Clear advantage: 2004.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Starting Pitching
Clemens, Boyd, Hurst, and Nipper vs. Schilling, Pedro, Lowe, and
Wakefield.  Clemens had his breakout year in 1986, going 24-4 and
setting the record with 20 Ks in one game.  Boyd was good, but
erratic, Hurst was excellent in the postseason, and Nipper was a
placeholder.  In contrast, Schilling is a power pitcher still in his
prime it seems, though he's injured, Pedro is slightly on his
decline, though his peak was so high he still is very good, Lowe is
erratic like Boyd was, and Wakefield is as good as his knuckler. 
Slight edge to 2004, would be greater if Schilling were not hurt.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bullpen
Bob Stanley, Calvin Schiraldi, &amp; co. vs. Timlin, Foulke &amp; co.  In
1986, the obvious weakness of the Sox was the bullpen.  The current
bullpen is among the best in the game.  Huge advantage: 2004.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What's the point of this exercise?  To show that this year's team
really has what it needs, and is clearly stronger than the 1986 team.
 (Actually, the 1986 team was not as good as the 1975-1979 Sox, but
the Yankees were also in decline in the mid-80s, so it was easier to
make the Series.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can any of the Red Sox pitchers hit for those three games in StL?
I don't think we want Schilling trying to run bases.  And what do
you do about Ortiz?  I don't think you want him out of the lineup,
so I guess you have to have him play first base.  Seems a bit of an 
advantage for the NL in general.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />		<b>Rick Desper (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 07:06:44 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wakefield and Martinez both pitched in the NL at the beginning of
their careers.  
And no, the Sox have Schilling scheduled to pitch games 2 and 6 at
Fenway, precisely for that reason.  
Ortiz will play first, and he'll have to suffer his defensive
shortcomings in exchange for his bat.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The biggest advantage for the Cardinals in St. Louis will be 50,000
screaming Cardinal fans.  Ortiz has played enough first base that we
can hope he won't be a liability.  First base is the easiest place to
hide a weak glove - I'm more worried about Manny quite frankly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I couldn't decide whether I wanted the Sox to face Houston or St.
Louis - both have great hitting, St. Louis has better defense, while
the Astros would appear to have better pitching.  (I'm very glad we
don't have to face Brad Lidge!)  Then I saw a clip featuring that
annoying hill in center field in Houston and that decided it.  I
don't want to see Johnny Damon running up a hill that's part of the
playing field!  Besides, a Houston/Boston series would have had a lot
of political overtones that we can thankfully avoid.  And with the
Cardinals involved, we can watch old tapes of the '46 and '67 series.
 They can trot out Bob Gibson, Carl Yastremszki, Stan Musial and
Johnny Pesky.  Should be fun!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
p.s. I heard a sportscaster last night say it was too bad Musial and
Ted Williams couldn't be around for this series.  I know Musial has
always flown under the radar compared to his contemporaries (esp.
Williams and DiMaggio), but I'm pretty sure he's still alive, right? 
<i>((I'm 99% sure he is, I know he was alive when Williams died
to comment on that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Personally, I'd rather go against the better defense than the better
pitching.  The Sox haven't really shined in extra bases or steals,
but they have in power hitting, so a walk or two and one out of the
park looks good and it doesn't matter how good the defense is in that
case.  Small margin either way though, it's going to be a good series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Wakefield actually is a VERY good hitter, Pedro is not.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 11:07:02 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm thinking Pedro should have at most two at-bats in St. Louis.
We'll be looking at "Extra Rest Pedro", so there's a good chance
he'll be throwing BBs on Tuesday.  But it's not like he'll pitch the
whole game.  And with the Sox bench and bullpen, pinchhitters should
be no problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((The Red Sox are planning to dump a pitcher from the WS roster
and bring back one more hitter too, I'm crossing my fingers
for Ellis Burks..... he was GREAT at the end of the season
pinchhitting and it would be neat.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <b>Rick Desper (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 11:27:13 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm too worried about Schilling's ankle to want to dump a pitcher. 
Maybe if they brought in McCarty (Dave, not Walter) who can pitch if
innings are needed?  
Though it would be nice to get Burks' bat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What do you think about the Mirabelli situation?  I think he should
start with Wakefield, like he did all season.  Varitek was a disaster
in game 6! And Mirabelli isn't a huge offensive liability.  And
having the right catcher can really make a difference as to how well
a pitcher throws.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((You shouda been at the press conference..... ;-)
They are pretty sure that Arroyo can be the rubber arm they need 
(and emergency starter) so that is not necessary.  I'm arguing for
Burks, they said they probably would do this, but no announcement
of whom yet.  The betting is that they've seen enough of Ramiro
Mendoza and that he is sure to be off the World Series roster.
And that too has been announced, Mirabelli WILL catch Wakefield.
You have it just right.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Dave Partridge (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 11:40:20 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No way do we want Wakefield throwing to Varitek.  Start Mirabelli and
when Wakefield comes out you can consider putting Varitek in then if
Mirabelli isn't hitting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 11:48:35 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh, I forgot about Mendoza.  Yes, by all means jettison him.  I was
thinking they'd have to get rid of Leskanic.  I also agree with their
attitude about Arroyo.  Arroyo has very good stuff, but his problem
is that he's prone to gopher balls.  VERY BAD problem against the
Cardinals lineup.   
Good on Mirabelli.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Though Francona has made a couple odd moves (most notably using Pedro
in game 7), for the most part I've liked how he's handled the team.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />		<b>Dave Partridge (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 12:01:25 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That one had me very worried until Pedro got it together and pulled
a couple of fastballs out of his back pocket.  Do you think Pedro
asked to be played?  I can't see any other reason to do that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 12:40:34 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think the original plan was Lowe for 3 innings and Pedro for 3 in
long relief.  But Lowe was pitching so well, and his pitch count was
so low, that Francona decided to stick with him.  Apparently Lowe's
pitch count was only 69 when he was pulled - I would have kept him
in.  Given the 7 run lead at the time, I didn't see the need for a
pitching change.  I don't think Pedro asked specifically to be used
during the game, but Francona said after the game that, once Pedro
had started warming up, he was definitely coming in.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think Pedro may have been affected by the extra-long 7th inning
stretch typical of Yankee Stadium in the playoffs.  His pitches to
the first few batters were weak, but he gassed up for the last two
batters.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Dave Partridge (Fri, 22 Oct 2004 12:54:32 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just seemed at that point with the pitch count low and his
pitches still going great, why not have Lowe play it out and
let Pedro rest?  Oh well, I think our managers are required
to pull one bonehead move every series or they don't meet 
their quota.  At least this one didn't cost anything.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Rick is correct on the original plan.  But Lowe had only had 
I think two days rest from pitching another 70 pitches, or something like 
that, so he simply wasn't going to be kept in longer.  And Pedro
was not used to getting ready, sitting down, and getting ready
again, he was on his throwing day, and they intended to put him
out there and to the work, once he was warm.  Pedro himself said
that he wasn't warm at first, I think.  At that point, they
just wanted to get nine more outs, and Pedro was assigned three
of them.  Rick is right about the last part too, he was coming in
once he warmed.))

Hi Jim Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been meaning to write for oh, say, a decade here. I even have a
file that I lob <i>TAP</i> comments into on the intention of writing them up
into a letter when I have time to actually do it. Of course, spare time
never arrives. I'm in the Portland, OR, airport on a Friday afternoon
after having a meeting end early. I was having an enjoyable time reading
<i>TAP</i> when it suddenly occurred to me I could finish up the issue,
actually skip all that work stuff that should be ready sometime Monday,
and write you instead.
<i>((That is wonderful, it is really, really great to hear from you!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm in Portland coz I'm one of the folks riding point on a big
frequently exhausting integration project. We sold the company a bunch
of us founded, Mountain Hardwear, to Columbia Sportswear and we're now
trying to hook up computer systems, design calendars, and sourcing
procedures so that we can gain the benefits of both sides' expertise.
After 6-8 months of trying to stay out of it, I was forced to conclude
it was time to dust off the old Repo Man code of ethics and go for the
point of maximum intensity before we got caught like a fly in amber and
ended up unable to do anything at all. We're a 50M company with a focus
on top-end highly technical outdoor equipment. CSC is 20 times our size
and has sub-sub departments with more people than our entire company.
Needless to say there's a pretty significant mismatch in a lot of the
operating systems. Part of my job results from me being the only systems
guy in a collection of design and sourcing types. They all need to
maintain good working relationships to allow day by day functioning. I'm
the guy that has to point out somebody farted or that solutions aren't
being considered for political reasons or whatever and rattle some cages
then everyone else can work at repairs and a system that might actually
now work. I'm actually having fun but this is not something I would want
to do on a long term basis.
<i>((I can understand that, parts of my job operate similarly to that.
I've gotten so good at taking extreme criticism, even if completely unfair,
and then apologizing to get things back on track behind the scenes, that
people looking at the public picture get scared for me.
When people tell me things like this I look at them quizzically and 
wonder, well why SHOULD I embarrass them back in public, it really
isn't any big deal, and as you say, you just want everyone else not
to worry and get back to the task at hand.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't, of course, actually have my file of comments with me now that
I'm actually writing. 
<i>((Yeah, I make all these wildass comments expecting to have someone
haul me up on charges and then they let these things go, glad to hear
you jumping back in.))</i>
The last comment I remember adding to it involved
jazz and cymbals. I'm inclined to the free jazz types and you're never
gonna hear a Cecil Taylor project pushing the cymbals along click click
click, but I'm pretty sure that what's happening in more `traditional'
jazz.  The time keeping function is being delegated to the cymbal.
That frees up all the other limbs and drums for other more interesting
stuff. As a result the cymbal pips along somewhat monotonously if you're
focused on it but ideally pretty much subliminally. Something has to do
set tempo but the rhythm sections want to have fun like everyone else
and keeping time is not all that challenging.  At least that's my
understanding.
<i>((I think that's about right.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Somewhere I've even got a Desert Island list. One thing I noticed
compiling it (it actually physically exists as a CD case under my car
seat) is that what's in it is the result of a cross between the
emotional intensity of my life at particular time periods and the
quality of the music. Some stuff is there because it always sounds good.
Some of it was the sound track to intense experience. As a result
there's a lot from my late teens and twenty's but also music from my
son's birth and early years and from during my mother's battle with
cancer, `recovery', and then death all of which was happening
simultaneously.
<i>((Absolutely, but that's important, this is why I always stress
that **** on any recording don't really make any sense.  Except for the
fact that you or I could probably star most music we have on a relative
basis as far as what it means to us, but those relative ratings would
mean almost nothing to anyone else.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What's up with me on the game front? No time for the big gnarly PDM
games I used to enjoy or anything with much diplomacy. Some time back I
got into group Doom and Starcraft sessions at work using the network to
play with 4-7 people. Lately I've become a board game evangelist for the
type of games called German or Family Strategy Games...the type of games
covered on boardgamegeek.com., for example. 
<i>((Yeah, I wish I had more people around to play those games with.
I particularly love Puerto Rico, but never get to play it enough.))</i>
We were getting to the point
where Wendy (spouse), Griffin (son), and I might each be on a different
computer playing some computer game. We all decided that was idiotic.
I'd been reading about these games in Flagship magazine (thanks Paul
Evans) and a few other places and decided to give them a try. They're
great games! The require thought, play in 1-2 hours, are very well
designed and constructed, and often de-emphasis the `kill the other guy'
type of competition you find in military simulations. This makes them
good for playing with kids. The are a  &gt; lot &lt;  more fun to lose than any
games I've ever played and if you win it's a bonus. We play a lot at
home and I'm running a monthly game night at Griffin's school.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks to Bob Holt and your comments for sparking this letter.
<i>((OK, but before reading any further, I know I'm going to 
get castigated for pushing my comments to a shrill annoyance.))</i>

A3 - Cold Harbor: Great CD! Instant Desert Island candidate. An example
of a venerable rock and roll phenomenon: the genuine fake. The guy with
the southern accent is Scottish. The accent (and I'm basing my opinion
on some tapes of a radio show from the Meters' Aaron Neville on WWOZ) is
credible affectation of that odd black New Orleans accent that sounds
like it could be white ethnic Boston.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hip-hop: not dead yet and for the reason any genre is alive. There are
folks using it creatively and making very meaningful statements. I'll
cite a couple of recent Bay Area examples, The Coup's say Party Music or
really any of their CDs and Lyrics Born's CD. I will try to send along
the evidence by post.
<i>((I know, in the week after I said that I heard three separate distinct
hip-hop songs that really made me sit up and take notice.
Unfortunately, each of them was in an anonymous situation where I had
no way of identifying the artist.
It will be cool serendipity if one of them turns out to be one of these groups.
To be more precise, I've gotten quite sick of what I think of as the 
"football player's raps" which are the relatively fast paced simple message
rhymes about famous athletes and media types and such.
The more interesting ones I'm talking about had much deeper lyrics, with varied
and interesting rhythms, and were generally just MUCH slower, not so over
packed with words shooting from idea to idea before you had a chance to hear
them.))</i>

Playlist: Geo Clinton - TAPOAFOM: one of the Desert Island collection
copied onto an iPod.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((George Clinton is just SUCH an amazing guy.
For me, in that sense of context, I got hooked on George Clinton hanging 
around my college radio station after my late night progressive rock shift
ended with the black guys doing the overnight shift.
Sometimes, I even went ahead and played a George Clinton cut or two on my 
morning Jazz shift, just for fun (I know I annoyed purists in my audience
on that score as I could sometimes play Bessie Smith, Coltrane, Al Jarreau,
Earth, Wind and Fire, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, Oregon, Bird, and
Jeff Beck all in the same set to go with that stray Clinton cut).
Other times I'd be more traditional.
But whenever I hear George Clinton I think of that studio at 2AM or so
on some Saturday night.))</i>

<br /><br /> <b>Doug Kent (10-09-04)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim, I've been here at McKean for a month, and finally I'm starting 
to feel like a human being again.
The transfer itself went about as well as could be expected.
I only had to spend one night in the "Lewisburg holdover" area - a
collection of triple bunks in the Lewisburg pen designed to hold
inmates awaiting transfer to other institutions.
The next day I was bused here, and within a week I had my property.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As you might remember, the whole reason I came here is that Allenwood
stopped offering the Drug and Alcohol Program (RDAP).  McKean is now the 
only camp in the northeast region which offers it, and it shows.
This place is packed to overflowing, and the waiting list for RDAP
is so long that taking it often only saves an inmate six months off 
his sentence, instead of the usual nine or ten.
Three of the camp's TV rooms have been converted into `bubbles' - dorm-type
rooms with bunkbeds to house additional population.
I'm living in the biggest one - 20 inmates in a room a little bigger than
20 feet by 20 feet.
Even this is not enough.
Currently, nine inmates who transferred here in the past week are stuck in
"the hole" (the special segregated housing unit for discipline problems -
more on that later) because there is not a single open bed in the camp.
And the rumor has it that more transfers are expected this week.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I found a job as an orderly in my housing unit.
My job is to clean a microwave area, hand out spray bottles from 
a locked cage to other orderlies, refill them, and wash a load of rags
every day so the orderlies have something to clean with.
It's simple and boring, but keeps me a little busy.
Besides, it's better than the alternative.
Anyone who doesn't find himself a job quickly ends up on landscaping....
you don't want to be stuck there, because in the winter that's "snow
removal detail".
Since I'm told it snowed at least a few flakes for 54 days straight
last winter, it sounds like landscaping is a bad career move at McKean.
<i>((Hmmm, sounds like a lot of snow.
Are you close enough to Lake Ontario to get caught in the extreme
edges of the lake effect storms??))</i>
Orderlies who do a poor job find themselves transferred to landscaping.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This camp is very compact compared to Allenwood.
Basically the whole place is housed in three buildings, two dorm buildings
and the administration building.
<i>((That would seem to make for less space in which to landscape and 
shovel snow....))</i>
It leads to a slight feeling of claustrophobia for those of us who came from
Allenwood, but you get used to it after a few weeks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My big "adventure" here at McKean took place two weeks after I arrived.
One morning a C.O. told myself and another inmate to sweep out and mop his office.
I swept and mopped while the other inmate dusted the desk and cabinets.
No problem, it only took about five minutes.
The following morning, a different C.O. pulled me aside and asked if I had
taken a pair of sunglasses out of the office.
I hadn't, and I told him so..... if there is one thing in this world I <i>don't</i>
need, it's a pair of sunglasses.
First of all, I wear prescription glasses, and second of all I try to stay out
of the sun because of my history of malignant melanoma.
I think I've owned two pairs of sunglasses in my life.... they both cost $10
or less, and one of them I never had occasion to wear.
<i>((I hear you, I don't think I've ever owned a pair of sunglasses and wouldn't
think about them at all for similar reasons, though luckily I've never had skin cancer.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, around lunchtime, I'm pulled out of the line and brought into one of the 
Administrator's offices.
Here they inform me that regardless of what I say, I'm going to be "locked up"
and sent to the segregated housing unit (S.H.U.), as is the other inmate,
because of this missing pair of sunglasses which I'm told belong to one of the C.O.'s.
This is a big deal - stealing from a staff member is nothing to joke about.
Despite my claims of innocence, off to the S.H.U. we go.
The Lieutenant there started to ask me for the details of why I was there,
but when the other inmate came in they moved me to a holding "bullpen"
area while they questioned him.
I couldn't hear most of the conversation, but it was at this point I realized
that he had already returned the sunglasses!
From what I could tell, his story was that I had stolen them, but as a good
guy he'd taken them back from me so he could turn them in.
Wonderful!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There isn't really anything to do in "the hole" except read, eat, and sleep.
You live in a 10x6 room, containing a metal desk, a bunkbed, and a one-piece
toilet/sink unit.
The door has a tiny window and a shielded hole you can speak through to staff
in the hallway.
The only time you leave the room is for showers (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
My room had three inmates, so I had to sleep on the floor (on a thin foam pad).
Meals are given to you through a slot in the door.
Security is the word in the hole - if the door is going to be opened for 
<i>any</i> reason, everyone in the room has to be handcuffed first.
<i>((I'm a little unclear about how that happens, but presumably the 
shielded hole you describe is low enough where you can stick your wrists out
through it to be cuffed before they open the door.))</i>
Only one inmate can be in the hallway at one time.
The worst part is the isolation and the lack of information.
You can't call anyone until you've been there for a week.
You have no idea how long you'll be there - if you are under
"investigation", you can stay for up to 180 days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To make a long story short (too late),
<i>((I'm sure you could make it MUCH longer if you wanted to.... I would
think the isolation is strangely balanced by the closeness of having two
other people in there.))</i>
after five days they let me out.
Apparently they decided that my side of the story (in other words, the <i>truth</i>)
was the correct one.
The whole experience stressed me out quite a bit, especially because I've known
this other inmate for a year (he came from Allenwood too).
I never would have thought that he'd throw me under the bus with a convoluted lie
like that.
I only started to feel like a normal human being again this past week.
<i>((Do you get your orderly job back, or are you now about to end up on
the snow shovelling detail?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Incidentally, I don't know about Bob Belle, but FYI anyone in the Federal
prison system can be located on the www.bop.gov web site.
It should tell you their ID # and facility, and then elsewhere on the web
site you can find the mailing address for that prison.
<i>((Coincidentally enough, I just got a note from Bob, who seems about
the same as ever and he's been moved to Frackville and can be written to
at Robert Belle, ES-5939, 1111 Altamont Blvd., Frackville, PA  17931.
I'm sure Bob is reading your stories with some interest as he has been in
the Pennsylvania state system for a long time now.
In related news, the Kenny's have moved further into the suburbs and have
a new address as well.
Paul and Sandy offered me pizza if I came to help them move, but was just
a TAD too far to go for the day!  I wish them luck with the new house!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The big topic of conversation these days (aside from baseball - go Sox
[now that my Twins are out of it] 
<i>((Well, see the running diary discussion up above, in all of its pain
and glory.))</i>
- and football - go Giants) is the Blakely case currently being decided by
the US Supreme Court.
It could very well eliminate the current Federal sentencing guideline system
and their use of enhancements.
I don't know if overturning the constitutionality of that system could alter
my sentence.
I've written my lawyer, but I have to assume that I'll be serving the full
sentence I was given.
It's easier to expect the worst.
<i>((I can easily understand that.
I'm not even close to an expert either, but I believe the nature of HOW and
WHAT parts of the constitutionality are ruled on would determine that.
Once they get a hold of it, they don't have to narrowly stick to the issues
raised in the appellate briefs and they can make broader proclamations.
They also can rule very narrowly on something that only will affect future
cases and sentences.
I think the assessments I've been reading, and knowing this court, also 
suggests the latter.
And they may not get as excited as you and I might think they should with
unfairness between moneyed defendants and publicly defended ones.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I guess that's it for now, enjoy the upcoming Sox/Yankees series and take care 
of yourself.
<i>((You too!!
All those late games probably means you weren't allowed to stay up late to

Too bad!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Harold Reynolds is running the game of Colonia (see elsewhere in this
issue) and is interested in guest-GMing a game of Aberration.
Sean O'Donnell and Brendan Whyte are interested in Aberration.
Brendan and Sean BOTH need rules from Harold Reynolds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need two more players.
Bruce Edwards and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
it takes four and
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, Dave Partridge, and Eric Ozog are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, the other Modern game
is now done!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mike Barno and Edi Birsan run a great web site at http://www.diplomaticcorps.org!
Please check it out as they prepare to pass it along to the Germans and Sascha
Hingst/Frank Bacher this fall.
We're going to try to get everything updated on that site soon.
Get ready for German World DipCon...... it should be fun.
World DipCon will be going to Berlin after it goes to the Baltimore/DC
area next summer.
This fall the German team is running EuroDipCon at Darmstadt, Germany 
from Sept. 23 to Sept. 26 to practice running a big con.
Get out there and support them if you can.
E-Mail Frank Bacher for more info at: bacchusno1 of web.de

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): We are now in our sixth month of our Ferengi transformation.
I'm starting to enjoy the taste of beetle juice.
The unknown Vulcan race did not attack us and that's a pleasant surprise.
They did not assist the "this universe's version of the Federation"
that we are invading, and as a result we are adding a new troop transport
and an Ambassador class starship to our fleet.
I have received no word from the Tribbles and our communication spy net
could detect no communication between the Tribbles and the Klingons.
<i>((You do realize that would be VERY strange and Tribbles and Klingons
can't stand each other, remember.....))</i>
The Klingons are being invaded by the unknown Vulcan race, another race
whose language the Universal Translator can't comprehend, and yet a third
unknown race, while at the same time they are also attacking the Federation.
I have to hand it to Commander Worf, he does have a way of pissing people off.
I give him six months to his surrender, oh well, have some blood wine on me, 
Mr. Worf!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
The upcoming Fall 1917 will be two game years by that measure.
Even if Turkey is missing TWO of its home centers in Winter 1917,
I think we are still going to advance to the next level of
voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be
allowed with failure to vote equalling a yes.
If any other significant movement or centers change hands
then that will be another story, of course.
This does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is way ahead of this pace but Tom has the highest replenishment
but no points as of yet).
