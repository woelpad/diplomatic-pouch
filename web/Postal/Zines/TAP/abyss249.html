<p><br><p><br>``The Israelis seem to think that if we ask for a separate room that we
are asking for an independent state.'' and

<p>
``We are not in the business of working as the employees of the Israeli
occupation.
We are not in the business of becoming their collaborators.
What we want is the end of the occupation... [the Israelis] cannot say,
`You can have fractional responsibilities,' while they take away our
land and build more settlements.''

<p>
From Hanan Ashrawi, the first quote in 1991, when as lead Palestinian negotiator
she made that famous statement as the Israelis refused to ``officially''
meet the Palestinian delegation in a room.  The second quote is recent 
from a speech at Cornell University.
I just want to note that ten years have passed essentially with no 
discussion of the ``real'' issue - the Israeli settlements on the
West Bank, fortresses on the hills surrounding Palestinian towns.
Very sad, extremely sad, not diplomatic.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>This is a bit late, but it is mega-stuffed with subszines and all sorts of
reading material.
Back with a memorable issue #250 next!!!
                                    
<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we continue ``taking over the US hobby'' by keeping up an
extensive roster of subszines.
We have Michael Lowrey's <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a 
Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here 
as <i>Deny Everything</i>'s takes a major chunk of space in many issues.
This issue, we have the latest two <i>Deny Everything</i>'s as well as the latest
from Dave Partridge's <i>Tinamou</i> AND the latest <i>Houdini Blues</i>! 

<p>

Help, David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My team is sinking quickly into the cellar this year, but I have devious
evil plans for NEXT year!!

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently &#239;n stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter is unlikely to be starting any new games in the <i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
And of course for FIXING everything this time around!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ???</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>We're cancelling the search for Mickey Preston since Paul Kenny already
found him.
I'm looking for other people to search for, otherwise we will take a break.
I need someone ``big'' to announce in #250, please help me think of someone!!!
I will likely choose a missing ``Hobby Award Recipient" from the lists below.
If you haven't voted in the Hobby Awards, do it NOW!!!!
Get a ballot at:

<p>
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/BALLOT01.html

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
In a NEW announcement, we are reopening a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers in the future!!

The new Summer issue should REALLY be out shortly and is worth waiting for.
A ``wrap-up" of the 1999 WorldMasters tournament, plus some other great articles.
Stephen Agar has had a processing disaster with a hard disk crash on his
computer and the draft of the issue was lost, but believe me it IS worth waiting for.
We will reconstruct it as quickly as we can.
Apologies for the extreme delay!!
We almost have it reconstructed now, I'll turn to finishing that as soon as this
issue is out.
I need to keep remembering to back up all of my Dip stuff so this doesn't 
happen to me someday.

<p>
The previous New Year issue features a doozy of an interview
with Brandon Clarke of New Zealand.
Also, the ``Ruffians'' demo game has a write up with an introduction to the
full negotiation history on the Diplomatic Pouch's Showcase web site.
You can see how our very own Paul Rauterberg was screwed over by former
World Champion Chris Martin not once, not twice, but at least THREE times.
But Chris didn't win.... not that time.
There also are some summaries on all the different ways to play Diplomacy
in the World at the present time and some writeups on last year's major
British Diplomacy conventions.
Kath Collman's write up I found particularly gripping and illuminating reading!
If you want to subscribe in paper form at $3 per issue, 
North American subs should be sent to David Partridge, 
15 Woodland Drive, Brookline, NH 03033, USA. 
Stephen Agar is handling international postal subscriptions and you can write
to him at: 47 Preston Drove, Brighton, BN1 6LA, UK.
Issues from Stephen will cost you 2 GBP in the UK and 3 GBP for the rest of 
the world.

<p>
I will be continuing to resolve the question of the back issue subs.
I have money from Doug Kent now.
If you were a subber to <i>Diplomacy World</i> and explicitly are sure
you DO NOT want your sub filled out or you are sure you DO want your sub
filled out, then please contact me NOW.
I have begun the effort of contacting everyone directly and will finish it shortly.

<b>Jim-Bob Goes Dipping Across Europe, PART I</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>I am surely going to ramble on far beyond the patience of many of you, but
as you know that never stopped me before and won't stop me now.
All I can say is that I had another epiphany of a Dip experience,
not in that I was successful in any material way (I barely avoided
the type of performance that might have generated a Jim-Bob Challenge Cup...),
but I just had a hell of a lot of fun!
In my history in the hobby, I've had two such epiphany events that I thought
would never be topped.
One was at MadCon (a new MadCon is taking place the weekend after I write this
and I wish I was there) back in 1986 or so when I grabbed a great sleeping place
in the same room as the earthquake rending snoring of Jack McHugh and laughed with
Cal White and Mike Barno and James Wall and hosts Marc and Debi Peters about
nearly everything.
The other was at THE PudgeCon where Russ Rusnak and Daf Langley had that great
water fight and Eric Ozog and I had our uncontrollable giggle on Bob Olsen's
porch.  That was in 1983, I believe.

<p>
These last two weekends didn't quite have that kind of emotional high, but
might end up on the same level.  
In a much longer way, I'll see if I can bring that across.....

<p>
I was the first one to arrive at ManorCon this year, yes I was.
We were told not to arrive before 2 PM and since I flew direct to Birmingham
on the standard overnight flight, I arrived in the city a bit early.
I probably should have alerted someone and found somewhere to hang out and get
some food and the like.
But planning ended up not very high on my list of priorities before this trip,
so I just fell into things.
So, dragging all of my luggage, I bought the rest of the train tickets I needed
for my British travel and then took the train to the downtown Birmingham New
Street station.
I managed to wander around downtown (hey, I enjoyed it even though the locals
told me it is a dump), though there is a GIANT hole of a couple of acres in the
middle of it where they apparently are putting together some major urban renewal.
I found some decent food, I bought some stamps and mailed some postcards,
and then I grabbed a cab to the University.....
well, I gave VERY clear directions to take me to Chamberlain Hall, but got
dropped on the other side of the campus.
This matches my continuing experience every time I go to Britain with the
first cab I hail.
They always get lost or take me to the wrong place and each time ***I*** 
know I am in the wrong place from my map, but I figure, ``hey, I'm the 
foreigner, I must be wrong!''
Well, I was right and I had a quarter mile walk or more
(still dragging all my luggage) to the new ManorCon site at Chamberlain Hall.
The last time I was to ManorCon in 1994 (WDC IV), it was in Shackleton Hall, which I 
recognized as I walked past it up the hill.

<p>
But it did mean that I arrived at quarter to two instead of half past one,
since I was targetted to be REALLY early in the first place.
I was greeted by Kath Collman and David Norman, so I knew I was in the right place!
I also knew I was somewhere else as the TV in the lounge had on a cricket test
match, which I watched for a bit as I waited for others to arrive.
Soon I finally met Niclas Perez of Sundbyberg, Sweden who I've interacted with
on E-Mail quite intensely in the last year.
He didn't look at all like I expected, very tall and very blond with his large
backpack.
Diplomacy tournament chair Nick Kinzett set up the Diplomacy sign up board
and I watched as he and David Norman set up the Diplomacy room toward the
Diplomacy first round start at 6PM.
I also had the time to CAREFULLY read the tournament rules, discovering
that supporting orders for units from other countries required the specification
of the country in your order (e.g. A Ven S FRENCH A Pie-Tus).
This stood me in good stead relative to some others who were NOT aware of this
rule and it hurt them.
This wasn't very social,
but the bar did not open until 5:30PM and I didn't want to start playing
another game in the large open gaming room, so where were we to get some
liquid sustenance as I was greeted by and greeted the early arriving 
familiar names?

<p>
Ah, but then I finally met Toby Harris and he brought BEER!
He also brought the mercurial Fearghal O'Donnchu (Twerg)
and a dizzying array of other people, some of whom I had met at World DipCon X
in Baltimore last year and some who I was meeting for the first time.
This kept us quite lubricated until the Diplomacy round began.
Ah, ha, and I drew Austria!!
This would be fun.
Simon Hornby was Russia, Andrew Greco was Turkey, and Keith Smith was Italy.
I immediately sized up Keith's and Andrew's styles and knew I would have
to work out a devil's deal with Andrew.
While Keith and I surely could communicate and talk, he was just the kind
of rational irrational player who was sure to be difficult for me to ally with.
Germany was the Tournament Director for next week's World DipCon XI in Paris,
Thibault Constans, so it was good to meet him finally after corresponding with
him so intensely this year by E-Mail.
And France was Sean Colman, who was one of the contingent (along with Richard
Orme) all the way from Australia for this Dipping extravaganza.
Sean was, well, unique.  I'll explain as we go.
And England??
Yes, England was Toby Harris.
My first game here and I was to face Toby again (most of you will know of
the story of the first round of the WorldMasters 1999 E-Mail tournament,
and if you don't I don't have room to reiterate that here, but suffice it
to say we had a history).

<p>
To start the game off, we had what looked like a Western Triple developing.
I tried to warn Thibault that he was SURE to be stabbed by either Toby
or Sean or both (Sean clearly was a talented tournament player too),
but Thibault would not listen.
So, as I said, I made the Devil's deal and helped Sean take out Keith
(the above A Ven S FRENCH A Pie-Tus was my Fall 1902 order for that unit)
while allowing Andrew Greco's Turkey also to grow in an AT alliance.
See, Faz, AT's can work..... well, sort of.
Andrew did stab me in 1904 as Keith in Italy was barely hanging on
at the same level as Thibault in Germany.
Toby was angling for the win, but I decided that I would rather have
Andrew top the table.  Besides, no one was in position to help me
(Simon Hornby being engaged with Toby in the north and my units lying
between Sean's and Andrew's).  This also had a perverse sweetness,
as Toby's Turkey had defeated my Austria in the aforementioned WM99 game.
So, I had good knowledge of how to move Austria north to establish a
``north of the stalemate line'' beachhead!!
The games were run with fixed joint deadlines (David Norman's ubiquitous
computer countdowns with the time limits kept us on track) and the first
round went to 1909.
Could I survive until then?
Could I influence the board topping outcome between Andrew and Toby??
Thibault and Keith were out in 1905 and I held my own with five units.
I had F Nap and A Ven supporting Sean's F Rom so that I could convince
Sean to mix it up with Toby.
Yes, I tried to induce Toby to stab Sean too soon and he did.
And boy, was Sean tenacious (some would say obnoxious ;-) once stabbed!
Toby NEVER took a center off of Sean and I wasn't about to assist.
My other three units in 1905 were defending my homeland against Andrew's
attack.

<p>
From here though, things went downhill for me.  I moved to Tyo and started
supporting Sean in Munich (annoying Toby to no end) until I had to disband
it at the end of 1906.
But it was clear that I still couldn't defend my homeland, so in Spring 1907
I moved A Vie back to Tyo and supported Munich again in Fall 1907 and kept
that as my last unit.
Now I needed to figure out how I was going to survive two more game years
and bloody Toby's nose some more.
I stayed in Tyo in 1908, assisting Sean, and convincing Andrew not to take
my last center, but I knew that wouldn't work in 1909.
So, with my last breath, I stabbed at Toby through Munich in Spring and
into Toby's Berlin in the Fall!!!
I survived with one center.
Not great, but given the personalities and the board position, I couldn't 
have done much better and Andrew topped the board.
In ManorCon's complicated sums of squares scoring system, 
Andrew scored 44.22, Toby 29.87,
Sean 12.54, Simon with 4.62, and me with 3.47.
Thibault and Keith got 0.5 each for their 1905 eliminations.

<p>
Toby was mega-pissed and for a bit seemed as if he would never talk to me again
;-0  Well, not quite..... but I admit that I was VERY happy to take that 
center of Toby's at the end and I didn't feel as badly about Andrew's
board topping as I ``should'' have.
I think Andrew ended up around 5th in the Tournament standings, so he
can thank me for that.
If Keith Smith had been a steadier more world thinking player, I probably
would have allied with him and I certainly spent a lot of time talking to
him and his wife Eve over the next week and a half, but in this game
that alliance simply wasn't going to work and I knew it instantly.
Andrew played me just as he should have.

<p>
We were so intensely into the game, though, that we missed the cafeteria dinner
and the game ended so late that we didn't think we could get any food anywhere
else either.
So, I dipped and went without dinner that night, except for some beer.....
In the morning, I was so hungry that even the dorm English breakfast (which
was not stellar) tasted wonderful.
I brought my little portable battery operated alarm clock so I made sure I
was up in the morning for the 9AM Team round even though David and Nick weren't
going to let me play..... 
let me explain.
My main reason for being sure about going on this trip was that a professional
organization whose board I am on was having its biennial convention in York
starting that Sunday.
But I had to be there for a board dinner on Saturday night, so I had to leave
the ManorCon venue at 3PM.
Though that allowed for 6 hours of dipping, David and Nick properly ruled that
I shouldn't play since I wasn't guaranteed to finish.
But partly to show that there were no hard feelings and partly because I thought
it would be fun, I wanted to track the battle between the ``Toby-Dave'' team
and the ``Superpowers'' (formed by merging ``Best Asians'' with the Irish
crowd).
But ONE team of Oxford players was one player short as someone overslept.
So, to get things started, Nick and Dave asked me if I would fill the last
game slot as Russia.
I shrugged and said sure.
It was going to be a VERY good game with Susie Horton as Turkey (on the 
``Toby-Dave'' team), Demis Hassabis as France (on the ``Superpowers''
team as I think the Punisher...), Mark Stretch as Germany, William Attia
as England, James Hardy as Austria, and John Stratford as Italy.
But just as I got started, the missing player showed up and in Dippus 
Interruptus, I bowed out and he played the whole position.
As Susie and I talked then, and more later, we would have had MUCH, MUCH
more fun had I played the position..... but I was back to my tracking
of the teams.

<p>
I forget what the ``real'' name of Toby's team was, but I thought of it
as the ``Toby-Dave'' team since Susie's husband Dave Horton and Toby
led the team, though it was quite deep actually.
Niclas Perez was playing Austria and Niclas ended up winning ManorCon.
He played a great Austria, growing steadily to 10 centers by 1906 (when
I had to head for the train station).
Dave Horton was England and he never got really untracked.... dropping
to four centers in 1904 and two by 1906.
The brilliant veteran German player, Thomas Franke, was the team's France.
He got stagnated after taking Bel, Spa, and Por in 1901 and was knocked
down to four by 1906.
1999 WorldMasters Champion Lee Simpson was experiencing his first FTF
tournament play and wasn't handling it any better than any player used
to the pace of E-Mail does the first time around.
He played Germany for the team and while he got up to five units in 1903
he was playing for his life and quite surrounded.
He also was down to two units and looking close to annihilation in 1906.
Toby himself was playing Italy and had to do it all himself.
I enjoyed watching Toby play a masterful balancing game, stabbing to 
eight centers in 1906, but I'm not sure he was able to hold that.
Other than Niclas, his was the best performance on the team.
Leif Bergman was the team's Russia and he got to seven units in 1902,
when things were looking decent for the team, but got stuck there.
He was down to four units in 1906 too.
Finally, in the game that I almost was in, Susie Horton was Turkey
in the game noted above.
Susie had great trouble with my replacement.
While I surely would have been stabbed by Susie (whose play I came
to respect a great deal over the two weekends) at some point, we
also surely would have worked wonderfully well at the beginning.
But Susie was down to her home three in 1903 and 1904 before 
staging a valiant comeback to five in 1905.
Alas, she wasn't able to hold that and also looked in bad 
trouble as I left.

<p>
Meanwhile, I was tracking the Superpowers (I don't remember all
of the attachments, but each team player had a T-Shirt for their
superhero).  WDC X Champ Simon Bouton (Superman) and Vick Hall (Captain America)
were having some trouble, but Gihan Bandaranaike had 13 centers
by 1904!!!
And Twerg (Flash) was close behind, getting to 11 by 1906.
Demis Hassabis had 9, Chetan Radia had 7, and Brian Dennehy had 6
at that same point.
So, though the ``Toby-Dave'' team had 36 centers to the Superpowers
35 at the end of 1903, the gap widened to 56-34 in favor of the 
Superpowers by 1906!!
I don't think any other team was even close to that.

<p>
But I was gone by the end and I don't have too many details clear
about the outcomes of ManorCon.
I do know that Niclas won the Dip (as mentioned), the Superpowers
won the Team, and Nick Parish won the Croquet!!
I'm sure these are or will be posted somewhere shortly.

<p>
After my conference, I had a ticket from York to London King's Cross
on Thursday morning, July 26.
That was to hook up with the EuroStar for EuroStarCon on the way to Paris!
Shaun Derrick was the organiser of this wonderful event that made it
really easy for me not to pay ANY attention at all to what the 
arrangements were for World DipCon in Paris. 
I just knew when I had to get to Waterloo Station to meet the group
on time.
So, I had been to King's Cross before and knew that I could try to
maneuver the Underground, but after dragging my luggage all over
Birmingham the previous week I had reached my fill of this, so
I wanted to take a taxi (hopefully one that wouldn't get lost!!!)
but the Taxi queue at King's Cross was huge.
As I contemplated this, I spotted a private limo driver off to
the side and hopped the queue to ride with him.
I knew it might be really expensive, but the last thing I wanted to do was to
MISS the EuroStar when I knew NOTHING about where I was going in Paris.
I don't think I even had the hotel name on me!
And who knew what midday London traffic would be like.
Well, the limo was very comfortable, the driver quite chatty,
and he sped across town with great speed.
So, as I wandered around Waterloo station looking UP for the ``balcony''
that Shaun described, behind me I heard the totally unmistakable voices
of Eve and Keith Smith calling me!
They were the first ones there and I was second after being worried
about missing it!!
We were soon met by Ivan Woodward; the Aussies Richard Orme and Sean 
Colman; Dave and Susie Horton plus their delightful baby!;  
Best Asians Chetan, Vick, Demis, and Simon; David Norman and Mark Wightman;
Doug Massie and James Hardy; the quiet Peter Richardson (whom the WM E-Mailer
types know well!), and the personable but NOT quiet Bear Barrow
(I think I have nearly everyone in there).
Bear was one of the other Americans and I discovered he is the son of Don
Treasure (who I see mostly in szines like Steve Koehler's) but I had not
heard of Bear himself before.
We were to become fast friends!
BUT, the one missing personage was our fearless leader Shaun Derrick!!
I and many of the others didn't have our tickets and I started to worry again.

<p>
But that fear was groundless as Shaun finally arrived and our big group took off
for the train (his train into London had been delayed by various line problems).
The EuroStar is, I believe, one of the longest passenger trains in the world with
more than 400 passengers on each trip and guess what?
Shaun booked us in the VERY first car which meant we had to walk the entire
length of the train.
Good thing I saved up energy with that limo.
I had a funny moment with the X-Ray machine as I struggled with my various 
parcels and packages.
I put my large bottle of water through the machine as David Norman laughed
and laughed..... ``Jim, they can see that there's nothing but water in that.''
Well, we got there anyway.
Shaun almost had us taking over one entire cabin, but there was a group of
four women at one end and a family at the other end.
The family in particular didn't know quite what to make of a very loud
pack of game players as we pulled out all of these strange games to play,
moving around switching positions to get us on the board of the game we
wanted to play.

<p>
I wanted to play Dip of course, and we played two quick standard FTF 
gunboat games while we slowly moved across the south of Britain (seeing
a beautiful dust devil in a hay field but mostly ignoring the scenery
while we focused on our games).
Then into the English Channel tunnel and from there we moved much faster
(probably over 150 miles an hour) most of the rest of the way to Paris.
After the gunboat games, Doug Massie brought out a German cycling game
that became one of the staples of the rest of World DipCon.  I know I've
heard of it before, but it is out of print.
I'd like to find a copy in the states someday.....
more on that later.

<p>
Before we knew it, we arrived in Paris and of course THIS time we were at
the very front of the train!!
I changed some of my remaining pounds into francs and we gathered the
crowd for the trip on the Paris Metro to the hotel.
After lots more luggage dragging ;-)
we arrived at the Hotel La Louisiane.
Xavier Blanchot's grandmother owns the hotel and his family VERY 
generously opened practically the whole hotel to the foreign contingent
for free.
Getting a hotel in the center of Paris like that on the weekend of the
end of the Tour de France is especially generous.
Xavier himself checked in a few times to make sure we were all set,
but he did not play in the tournament himself, which was too bad.
I talked to him twice for brief periods to thank him personally.
If you want to see pictures of the place and where it was,
Ray Setzer has lots of them up on his website at: http://www.cat23.com/paris
The hotel spent some time in the nineteenth century as an old soldiers
home and it is in one of the more medieval feeling sections of Paris
with lots of narrow streets and street markets (not as many as the area 
southeast of the Bastille on the other side of the Seine, 
but more than any American city).
It also is very near one of the gallery districts which you encounter
moving down any of the side streets toward the Seine.

<p>
Obviously our group was a significant proportion of the foreigners, but
Toby Harris and Twerg and others also were there when we arrived.
One never wants to get between an Irishman and his beer and Twerg
wanted some.
But it was about 9PM and the major markets were closed, so Twerg (Flash)
started using his superpowers to find beer.
He started dancing and darting down the street asking everyone he
saw where he could find a store with beer (this is NOT a good 
question to be asking in Paris).
Why would you want to drink BEER in Paris???
He kept getting what seemed like leads and he danced across streets
and took the dozen or so people who started out with him and began
to lose them.
Finally I and two other people, I think including Doug Massie gave up
as they danced and sped out of sight.
We headed back to the hotel.
I went down the street the hotel was on toward the Seine and just ONE
block down I found a store with beer, but it wasn't cold and they
didn't have any ice.
So, knowing Twerg would buy FAR more beer than anyone could drink and
thinking he might find something cold, I returned to the hotel.
Twerg quickly arrived with three cases!!
After some laughing and some talking and some beer drinking, I could
see that the best thing for me if I wanted to go to the Louvre in the
morning before the Tournament started at 2PM, was to head to bed.
So I did.

<p>
Since this story is going to get VERY long, this is a good point to
break it.
You'll have to come back next time for the story of my trip to the Louvre
and the World DipCon XI tournament itself.
That will be fitting material for my #250th issue in any case!!!
Comments from anyone else who was there for publication will be most welcome!
There already has been a HUGE amount of discussion of scoring systems via
E-Mail, which I couldn't possibly reproduce here.

Hi Jim:
M Barno and I were among the attendees at the Sun Prairie Madcon
last weekend.  We agreed not to discuss the NonLawyers game, and we got 
along just fine.
     
<p>
It's funny- almost all of us Madlads are 50 pounds heavier and all 
of us have lost our facial hair.  Rusnak is by far the greyest of the 
bunch, although he lies in the middle of our group agewise.  (I was 
second eldest, thanks to Bill Becker being there-whew!).

<p>
<i>((I, on the other hand, have KEPT all my facial hair and have LOST
some weight, well only about ten pounds, but a little.))</i>

<p>
Both Marc and Debi Peters are exceptional cooks, so the chow was
fantastic (and no beef roasts fell off the grill as one did 18 years ago 
in Chicago!).
I broke my 16-year ``retirement" from ftf Dip, and perhaps my lack 
of practice was telling-my power was the first out of the game.

Here's another mini-review, this one for my first big live music 
event of the year [sad to say]:
      
<p>
``Hickory Smoked Blues", a festival named for its site, Hickories 
Park along the Susquehanna River in Owego, New York.  This was Saturday 
July 28, all afternoon and evening.  Headliner was worldfamed Roomful of 
Blues, 
<i>((From right here in Providence, RI, I've seen 'em many, many times
and have most of their CD's.))</i>
along with eight other national, regional, and local acts.  All 
had both original songs and classic blues-related material.  Eight hours 
of fun.  There were only a couple of thousand people there at a time, 
maybe three or four thousand at peak for the Roomful.  The lineup:
      
<p>
The Hitmen, from somewhere around the area.  Next, the Owego Free 
Academy Jazz Band from the local high school.  They were the only act 
without originals but their director might have done some new 
arrangements.  Then Red Light District, from Syracuse; a funk/groove 
sound, primarily originals but also covered Son Seals and the Grateful 
Dead.  From New York City came Michael Hill's Blues Mob.  A lot of 
history buffs in this zine's readership would like the song ``Monticello 
Nights", about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings in light of the DNA 
evidence.  It's on their latest CD from Alligator Records.  Next was 
local band Mule in the Corn, sounding mostly bluegrass/groove.  Bob 
Margolin, formerly of Muddy Waters' band, brought his current band for 
the next set including new material and classic Muddy numbers.  Oldline 
Chicago bluesman Carey Bell played next, backed by Margolin and his 
band.  Bell led with harmonica and vocals.  The Ithaca-based Bluecats 
followed, fronted by 13-year-old Randy McStine.  Mostly the sort of 
mid-century electric blues that gave birth to rock'n'roll.  Some of the 
Bluecats have been together almost twice as long as McStine's been 
alive, but the kid played a searing lead guitar that proved he belonged 
there.  (He'd already shown proof by drumming on M Hill's first song to 
fill in for the Blues Mob's late-arriving drummer.)  Roomful of Blues
rewarded the crowd with proof that the horns are not dead in the digital 
age.  A fireworks display closed the festivities.  I sat (or 
occasionally danced, making a kid ask me to teach him ``that cool dance" 
which in fact had no form or structure whatsoever) through the whole 
event, other than a walk in the woods to refresh myself.  On the whole 
it was an excellent experience thanks to every band.

<p>
Jim-Bob,

<p>
As you're probably aware, ESPN is going to create a made-for-TV movie based
on John Feinstein's book, &#196; Season on the Brink", which details the year he
spent following the Indiana University Men's Basketball team around (I
believe it was the '84 - '85 team...which included the infamous chair being
hurled across the court in Bloomington during a Purdue game).  Needless to
say, this item has received a LOT of press around here, mostly centering on
who would play the head basketball coach.  Our local paper had an article
this morning on possible selections for the part, which I reprint in part:

<p>
<i>((This sounds quite fascinating, but you should know as a ``cableless
household'' I really don't pay attention to what ESPN is doing, so I
was totally clueless about this....))</i>

<p>
Robert de Niro.  De Niro (as Knight) to IU president Myles Brand:  ``You
talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me?"
<i>((For my less Indiana focused subbers, Myles Brand looks very academic, 
kinda like Goz actually, but smarter.... ;-) and just doesn't look right when
in the same room as ANYONE playing Knight....))</i>

<p>
Brad Pitt.  Pitt will connect with females ages 18-34, an important
demographic that Coach Knight misses.
<i>((Pitt will have to gain a whole lot of weight, but he has the 
impenetrable accent thing down perfectly.))</i>

<p>
George C. Scott.  Who was more commanding than Scott?  Ok, he's dead.  But
that won't stop Bob Knight fans from clamoring for the only man in Hollywood
who was man enough to fill Knight's shoes on the silver screen.

<p>
Vanessa Redgrave.  This is a bit of creative casting, but consider:  She's a
tall woman, controversial in her own way, and her first major hit movie in
the United States was ``Blowup", released in 1966.  She's a perfectionist who
brings a lot of presence to the stage and always speaks her mind.  Need we
say more?
<i>((I like this idea a whole lot..... Vanessa is stupendous.))</i>

<p>
The Rock.  The Rock is one of the stars in Hollywood's ``The Mummy Returns".
Neil Reed never would have lived had The Rock laid the smackdown on him,
baby!  Realistically, the new ESPN movie about Bob Knight couldn't be any
worse than ``The Mummy Returns" - actually both movies could share the same
title.
<i>((Huh???  Who is the Rock now??  I gathered from Steve Langley a few
issues ago that he is some kind of wrestler or something?
That should fit with Knight's penchant for physically threatening people
who speak against him.))</i>

<p>
Foghorn Leghorn.  Foghorn is a tall chicken who's always trying to justify
himself to others.  Foghorn's story so closely matches that of Coach Knight
that they could play each other in a double-bill.

<p>
A local sports radio show is soliciting ideas for other parts in the movie.
The best one that I've heard is Danny DeVito as Gene Keady.

<p>
There.  That's my basketball input for you for this millennium.

<i>((That's too bad, we love basketball talk around here....
the local Celtics look like they are moving beyond the Pitino years
with a flourish but Rick stays in the news in Providence by 
publically declaring that his ties with Providence College are
``cut'' over the firing of his friend, PC Athletic Director
John Marinatto.  
John is one of the good guys in the NE basketball scene and
we are sorry to be losing him (mostly internal politics at PC).
But the basketball team looks great for the coming year.
Point guard John Linehan is making preseason all-star teams
and the rest of the team from last year is largely back.
They will do well in the Big East and nationally for sure.))</i>

Jim-Bob,

<p>
When last we left the Indiana Quarter issue, I had assumed (there's that
dirty word) that the final decision had been made to choose the one with
Chief Little Turtle, who fought the white man, and then, like any good
businessman or Diplomacy player when he's been defeated, traded with him.
In fact, it appears that it was only the recommendation of the U.S. Fine
Arts commission that I'd heard.  Our Governor made the final decision
yesterday.  And he has chosen to have the one with a background of 19 stars
(Indiana being the 19th State) and outline of the State itself, and a
foreground of a race car.  Not just ANY race car mind you.  In fact, it
doesn't look like ANY thing I've ever seen.  Any hard-core race fan will
note that the front wing is very large, the rear wing very narrow, the
fuselage very small and very short.  Ugly.

<p>
<i>((You're kidding, right??? No, you probably aren't..... haha, 
well you won't be laughing at anyone else's quarters now, will YOU??
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Teach you to rag on another state quarter...))</i>

<p>
Every state has its quirks.  Indiana is a lot bigger than Rhode Island, so
we have a lot more quirks.

<p>
Didn't we deport you?  What are you doing back in-country?
How'd it go at the World's?  Who finished second to you?

This is an interesting new challenge for me.  I've spent the last 17 
years working on foreign policy issues in Congress.  I have at times 
felt like a Best Man at a string of other people's weddings (since 
foreign policy, to be effective, ultimately requires executive branch 
leadership).  I guess it is now time to explore more directly the

While on my travels in Victoria, B.C. I was surprised to find a 1999
album from Clan of Xymox called Creatures.  If you remember Xymox, they
went techno (and sucked) after their excellent Phoenix album in 1991. 
Well, the Clan is back (in The Netherlands) and the Creatures album is
very similar to their old style of haunting synth gothic rock,  like the
Medusa album, although it seems more darker sounding-even evil-and the
original lead singer now sounds like a possessed Peter Murphy. 
Particularly striking are the songs Taste of Medicine (nearly an 8 minute
jam), All I Have, Falling Down, and the instrumental Without a Name,
which sounds like a theme from some slasher movie.  If you're not yet
past the ``dress in black gothic rock stage", a.k.a. the Sisters of Mercy,
then this album is for you.  The Clan of Xymox also have a 1997 album
called Hidden Faces and a 1984 release called Subsequent Pleasures, which
predates Medusa.  Overall, the Creatures album is fairly good, and I plan
to eventually get Hidden Faces through Metropolis Records on the www
(www.metropolis-records.com), and you can check out the Clan's website at
www.clanofxymox.cybercomm.nl.

Man, I'm quite pleased (and surprised) to hear Xymox
is back.  Ever since I braved the `Metamorphosis'
album, I've considered them dead (the `Phoenix' and
`Medusa' and `Twist Of Shadows' albums were they're
very best of all I've heard!). 

<p>
Btw, Eric,
I saw Echo and the Bunnymen with Cortez a little while
ago in Chicago.  They were fantastic, however a
fleeting appearance- seemed like they rushed through
the set list.  But they were great nonetheless.  
The new album has really grown on me, I love it. Great
Bunnymen tunes.. Also picked up their new box set full
of unreleased "b-sides" and stuff.  Great investment
for any Bunnymen fanatic like us!  I have to say,
they're my 2nd favorite band now, after Church.

``Planet of the Apes" - a movie

<p>
Back in 1964 I was taking a class in Philosophy and the instructor 
recommended that we read Pierre Boulle's `Planet of the Apes'.  I had already 
read the book which had been translated to English the year before.  It was 
touted as exciting new Science Fiction, and in those days Science Fiction was 
all that I wanted to read.

<p>
I asked the instructor why he was recommending the book.  He said that it was 
an interesting Allegory.  You mean like `Animal Farm' and `Slan' I asked.  I 
could tell by the momentary blank in his eyes that he had never heard of 
`Slan'.  ``Uh, not quite," was his hedge of an answer.

<p>
Not even close is the real truth.  Both `Animal Farm' and `Slan' were truly 
interesting and allegorical.  `Planet of the Apes' was just bad science 
fiction.  Or, maybe it lost a lot in the translation.  Boulle's `Apes' were 
never recognizable as examples of human societal types.  His story never 
really made a lot of sense, and the ending, while a total surprise was only 
so because it was so totally off the wall.

<p>
In 1967 the book was made into a movie that improved only slightly on the 
book in that some of the `Apes' in the movie were interesting characters.

<p>
Now, a whole new version of ``Planet of the Apes" is out.  This one may be a 
bit closer to being allegorical.  The story itself is new, although the 
premise of a modern man thrown into a world where his species is not dominant 
is the same.  Different story, much the same off the wall ending, except that 
this time I wasn't surprised.  I might almost have liked it if Tim Burton 
hadn't gone for the surprise ending and had left his hero in the situation of 
leading the humans and the apes into a brave new world together.  I say 
almost.

<p>
Technically it was brilliant, although there was one ape lady who was way too 
humanlike in her mammilary development.  The tendency the apes had to jump 
and shriek when surprised was a good touch.

<p>

<p>
<i>((I'm sorry, Steve.
I would take all that a few steps further.
I really like Tim Burton, but I think he needs to have his Directorial
license revoked, possibly permanently.
And he should become a Production Designer instead.
I really was looking forward to this movie, since despite the major plot
flaws, I was one of the people that really TRIED to like ``Sleepy Hollow"
last fall.
But no, there was NO excuse to make this movie except that Tim and his
buddies decided something like: ``I think we can do some way cool sets
and costumes if we remake Planet of the Apes!!''
The main ``ape house'' set was imaginative and stunning, especially when
the apes bounced all around it when surprised or disturbed.
But it just WAS NOT ENOUGH to get past the lamest story I've seen in many 
a year - and when you're talking Hollywood that is really saying something!!
It was just a total mess from beginning to end.
And I know it was ``cool'' but that battle scene between the Apes and Humans
staged the way it was just left me cold.
The fear of water thing was played like a lame plot device and the sequence
of ``surprises'' at the end just became more and more incredulous.
It wasn't even funny!!
Bye, bye, Tim Burton, we loved ye, but unless you can get your head out of
your butt, we can't love ye no more.))</i>

``Legally Blond" - a movie

<p>
I have to admit I was sucked in by the trailer.  Turns out the movie was all 
the trailer promised, that is to say a really funny `blond joke,' and better. 
 There actually was a real plot with character growth, and a more than 
interesting character.

<p>
Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job of being the stereotypical blond, even 
teaching a short seminar on `blond' to the customers of a beauty salon.  She 
was also very compelling as a girl who realizes that no one ever has nor 
probably ever will take her seriously, because all they see is `blond.'

<p>
I laughed, I empathized, I had a really good time.  This has to be my pick of 
the week for the past two weeks.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Steve, Steflan of aol.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((Damned straight, Steve!!
There were a few of the jokes, especially some of the ones in the beauty
salon that went just that extra touch too far for me.
But on the whole this was a thoroughly entertaining movie with REAL
characters having complex back stories that you could see the glimpses of.
This is all too rare these days.

<p>
The scenes at the small college with the sorority at the beginning were
just tremendous.
What design work!!
And I generally hate lame animals in movies but Reese's character had
a pet dog that actually added to the movie rather than distracting from it.
Plus, as an academic oriented person, the slams of that environment were
right on target.
I think this clearly was one of if not THE best of the summer movies.
A real surprise!!
I suppose American Pie 2 is out now though..... sigh.))</i>

<p>
``Final Fantasy" - a movie

<p>
First let me say again, computer animation absolutely rules.

<p>
The animation was awsome.  It was also a bit distracting.  I was so into 
looking at how well things were animated that I was not pulled into the 
movie.  Of course, the movie as a movie wasn't all that compelling.  Maybe 
I'm just getting picky but I really do like there to be a decent story when I 
go to a movie.  The story was even simpler than the `Tomb Raider' story.  Oh 
well, for a while I guess they can get by on the superb animation.  Sooner or 
later someone will realize that they can make an even better movie if they 
have a good story, too.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Steve, Steflan of aol.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((Yeah, I didn't see this one, but I did see Tomb Raider and ALMOST
tried to like it until the story went over the lameness edge (Ms. Jolie
saves a guy trying to kill her with a special power 
for absolutely no reason I could see and with no consequences worth 
discussing afterward.).
I have been reading a bit of the Decameron by Boccaccio lately 
(Middle Ages Italian work) which has HUNDREDS of story lines that
I'm sure Hollywood could steal.
It actually has fun little short stories (all Hollywood has the 
patience to tell anyway) that don't sound like I've seen them all before.
And there is incredible variety..... sigh.))</i>

``The Score" ... a movie

<p>
Great cast.  Too little story.  This was a caper movie.  One of the rules in 
a caper movie is that there are lots of twists and turns to the plot.  This 
didn't twist and turn so much as sort of swerve a little as it progressed 
down a fairly predictable path.  The acting was excellent.  The caper was 
challenging enough.  The story was over while I was still waiting for the 
twist ending.

<p>
Robert de Niro kept threatening to not do the caper.  He never followed 
through on the threat.  One nice possible twist that was left out would have 
been for him to walk out only to find that his old friend Marlon Brando's 
silent partners had kidnapped his girl friend to use as a lever to keep him 
in line.  The silent partners were mentioned, but nothing ever developed with 
them.

<p>
Oh well.

<p>
Taking a ``cocktail" of AIDS drugs is complicated. The exact details vary
from patient to patient, and are changing all the time, but it's something
like this: you must take 15 pills every day on a strict 8-hour schedule for
the rest of your life. You take some pills with water, some on an empty
stomach, and some on a full stomach. Sticking to this schedule is hard, even
if you have lived your whole life in a culture where the clock determines
when you sleep, eat, drink, and work, where you are surrounded by clocks on
your computer, your VCR, your appliances, the wall, and your wrist.  In one
study of Americans who had been on the cocktail for two years, only 50% said
they always took the pills according to schedule. And, if you miss just a
couple of doses of a protease inhibitor, the virus can mutate and make the
drug useless.

<p>
<i>((Since I work in health care, I am well aware of all of this.
The facts of what has happened in Africa when the full cocktail is 
made available stuffs much of your concern in the can.
Perhaps because their lives might be less rushed than ours, 
this is NOT the problem that you and Natsios assume.))</i>

<p>
I don't think it's racist to suggest that people who live in a third-world
village or shanty-town (on any continent) will have even more trouble with
the cocktail regimen than the average American. 

<p>
<i>((Perhaps, but it also is untrue and that makes it racist in my view.))</i>

<p>
And this assumes they will
receive, understand, and believe correct information about the dosage and
schedule - which is a lot to assume in the context of very poor countries
with dreadful social services.

<p>
By comparison, the rules for taking antibiotics are dead simple: don't take
them unless you have a disease that antibiotics can actually treat, take one
or two pills a day until they run out even after you start feeling better.
Yet, antibiotics are routinely misused in poor countries (and in some groups
in rich countries, such as drug users with tuberculosis).
<i>((I agree this is a bigger problem in many ways than AIDS drugs.))</i>

<p>
It's easy to caricature Natsios's argument as ``black people are stupid", but
he raised real problems that we can't just wish away. Treating AIDS in
Africa won't be easy.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>

<p>
<i>((Sorry, but the argument is really about corporate power and money.
The problem with treating AIDS in Africa is that it might be expensive,
but worse it will require the multi-national pharmaceutical companies
to expose practices that may have repercussions elsewhere.
It is quite simply a huge moral outrage.
A complex issue, to be sure, but let's make sure we understand the 
chief barriers and not get confused by assumptions from far, far away.
That includes mine, by the way.
I believe people who I've met that have walked in the moccasins there.))</i>

He said he'd talk to him.  Gonna start a church where you can save yourself,

You can make some noise, When you've got no choice...

You told me useful things, what people think of me, I guess I should thank you.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>REGULAR Diplomacy Game Opening for E-Mail Oriented Players: Tim Miller,
Daniel M&#233;hkeri, Jim Sayers, Allan Heikkinen, 
Adam Mitchell, and Chris Lockheardt are signed up. 
This game is FREE, but you have to be pretty active on E-Mail or I won't
let you in, we need just ONE more player.....

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage but they have turned us down.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.
HELP!!!

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
I've decided to kill the Star Trek Diplomacy opening.  
It clearly wasn't resonating.
I think I'll try again when Colonia ends.
Sorry about that everyone.
I owe Chris Trent $20 back, but according to my records I don't 
have money from anyone else.
If you think that is incorrect, let me know.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED game.
The Breaking Away game is starting below, get me names, riders and cards!!!

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at:

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) This game from negotiation hell seems to have been joined by the Duck.
Welcome, Mr. Williams, so nice of you to come and play.
Some interesting, even fascinating press.... none from YOU though,
unless YOU are the mysterious Black Presser.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY to ALL): Due to recent events, the French leader will no longer be
called by name. He will now be simply referred to as ``that gentleman who
spoke the other day".

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): Does that impact me too??

<p>
(ARCHDUKE FERDINAND): I'd apologize to my allies (and my enemies) for a lack
of communication this season, but since I am to be assassinated in 1914
anyway to set off World War I, why bother?  Musical picks for this issue -
Haunted by Poe, Terrorizing Telemarkets by Jim Florentine, and the upcoming
CD by Kay Hanley.

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA):  Sigh.  Nothing for so long.  I feel so unloved in
Vienna.  So I might as well make the most of it.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE NATION OF AUSTRIA):
A Declaration of War is now in effect between your nation and my own.
A lack of communication and the attempt to take Rumania by your country has 
brought this about. God save your people!

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE):  For the record, a move to the Ionian Sea will be looked
upon as an act of war.  Note that I don't think that you'll get there, but
you apparently do.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-PARIS): The fleet in the Channel doesn't have anything better to do
than head south and watch the upcoming fireworks in the Med.

<p>
(ITALY to AUSTRIA): Sorry about that. I needed the fleet.

<p>
(EDINBURGH-WORLD): The German delegation has been found!  Hoping they're not
Something to Be Scared of.

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND): Fall 1902 is when it happens, right?

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): You mean, when Don Williams starts negotiating??

<p>
(CHICAGO CALLING): The Cubs are still in first and actually traded like they
meant it.  It's almost too exciting to not believe it.  I didn't follow the
Red Sox..are we still on track for the Anti-futility World Series?
<i>((I'm not sure, the Red Sox can't get pitchers back fast enough
before losing some more.
They are definitely on a downturn and need some kind of shake up.
We'll see what happens before they play the Yankees head to head.
I'm sure that they have to win the division to get in the playoffs
though technically they are closer to the wild card.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The concession to Turkey fails.
A seven way DIAS draw is proposed.... and hey, it might even make sense.
Please vote on it with your Winter orders.
If you fail to vote, it cannot pass.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TUR to ALL): Gee. A DIAS eh? I've never participated in
a seven way draw before. It should please the French
and Italians at any rate...

<p>
(ENG - AUS): If you want a seven way draw then you better 
rescue Fra. Also, a correction, we (the West) are not playing for a six 
way draw. 

<p>
(BOOB to ENGLAND): Perhaps they just have done that very thing!

<p>
(LONDON, OCT 31, 1906): ``For my next crusade", intoned Saint
Edward VII, ``I shall lead my fellow monarchs, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Czar 
Nicholas II and (that pipsqueak) Victor Emmanuel I and do battle to 
depose the anti-Christian Emperor Paul I of Austria -Hungary, who 
consorts with the heathen Sultan Abdul Ahmid Ellis III." 

<p>
(LONDON, NOV 1, 1906): Prime Minister John Beale scowled, 
as he read the headlines in 
the Times newspaper. ``What is that insufferable, sanctimonious pest 
Edward planning to do now?"

<p>
(NOTE FROM BUDDY): I had developed Adult Type II onset diabetes, so the doctors
said, and then diverticulitis.  I then took 5 colonics, and 9 foot
reflexologies.  In addition, and you must buy this small booklet ... The
Master Cleanser by Doctor Stanley Burroughs ... , did the lemonade cleanse.
Lost weight, from 186 pounds [hey, you do not remember me above 112 pounds]
to now 148, and waist line from 58 down now to 36.
Further [and you must buy this book also ... Hiatal Hernia Syndrome by
Theodore A. Baroody, N.D., D.C., Ph.D.] I discovered about the Hiatal
Hernia, had my stomach adjusted, meaning taken downward in the body, and got
rid of all of those body pains I had in one fell swoop.
Do these things for yourself.
I don't mind you publishing the above.  Might help a lot of worn out dip
players.

<p>
1) As I worried, there were a few mistakes in the adjudication last time.
Sorry about that.
Goes to show you what happens when you adjudicate at warp speed.
Thanks to the players who assisted in discovering the problems.
I hope we're all set now.
The ``changed moves'' are listed before the Autumn and Winter adjustments.

We say goodbye to Terry (thanks for all the fish!) and Jim (thanks for 
the Aussies....).
There might not be much more time left....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to ALL): Can we please kill Austria so we
don't have to look at his insipid press anymore?

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE NATION OF FRANCE):
You frogs unt must move against the Mad Pope in za East NOW or all is unt 
lost!!! Do-not take your unt time about zis....vee are all falling around 
like dominoes....

<p>
(BOOB to AMBASSADOR POLLARD): I fail to see why this is insipid....
lame? perhaps.... ethnically insulting? probably.....
but not insipid.....

<p>
(RUSSIA to BOOB): Hey, what happened to our map?
What, we don't rate one anymore?

<p>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): The rules have always been.... you always get a Spring
and Fall map and get Summer and Winter maps according to space
considerations and page counts.
You missed out on that one.
Save your issues and you had a map after Spring!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DESIGNER'S COMMENT):  Ironic that having removed the upper limit of 
15 on the value of players' replacement cards, the highest replacement 
card last turn was ... 15!
<i>((Indeed, but we broke through that this time with one of your
riders and three quadrilaterals taking the honors!!
At first, I thought the seven was going to be blank, but you shored
that potential hole up to make things for your other two riders.))</i>

<p>
(BRIT PACK - QUABBIN RESERVOIRS): Weird fact for you.  As you probably know, I 
produce a board game version of Breaking Away through a small games company 
called Fiendish Board Games.  It's a two-man company.  My partner lives in 
Greenwich (the name of your ``C" driver) whilst I live in Enfield (your ``B" 
driver).  It is now safe to exit the Twilight Zone.

<p>
(BOOB to TWILIGHT ZONE): Not really, since you are aware that none of those
Massachusetts towns exists any longer, having been flooded by the aforementioned
reservoir??
Hope it isn't making a prediction for the company, unless you are to be flooded
with orders.

<p>
(QUADRILATERALS to BOOB): I knew there was some rule I was forgetting!

<p>
(BOOB to QUADRILATERALS): It looks like you had it all planned to me!!

<p>
(FIELD to 1-PLAYERS): Don't you know a bicycle won't stand up if you ride too
slowly?  Now get back on and start pedalling!

<p>
(QUABBINS to BOOB): I'm gonna bet we get some larger cards played this time.

<p>
(RICK - DAVE): Well, the Tinamou was Jim-Bob's idea.  The original bird was
going to be an ostrich.  

<p>
(ERIC to TINAMOU DAVE): They don't fly so much as <i>plummet.</i>

<p>
(STORIES OF THE BORDER RIDERS): First off, please accept my apologies.

<p>
I have been slowly wading through Sir Walter Scott's Waverly Novels as
bedtime reading.

<p>
When I signed up for this game, I was part way through `The Monastery'. 
In it, Simon Glendinning is a feudal subject of the Monastery of Saint
Mary, presided over by the abbot, Boniface.  Simon dies at the Battle of
Pinkie-Cleuch, leaving a widow and two sons, Halbert and Edward
Glendinning.  Sometime after the battle, Walter, the Baron of Avenel,
also loses his life whilst skirmishing with the English.  The
Glendinnings take in Walter's widow, Alice, and daughter, Mary.  During
the subsequent period of unease, Walter's younger brother, Julian, with
his follower, Christie of Clint-hill, occupies the Castle of Avenel,
preventing Alice and Mary from returning.  Eventually, Alice dies, and
Halbert, Edward, and Mary grow up.  Halbert gets himself into a scrape,
runs off toward Edinburgh and falls in with the Earl of Murray. 
Protestant England sends a force to lay waste to the Monastery.  Before
Murray, with Halbert acting as scout, can arrive, the English defeat the
forces of Saint Mary's, with the loss of Julian, Christie, and Julian's
hand-fasted wife.  Halbert finds their infant on the battle field. 
Halbert's scrape is resolved; for his services to Scotland, he is
married to Mary Avenel and given possession of Avenel Castle.  Edward
joins the monastery.

<p>
Queen Mary of Scotland never appears in `The Monastery'.  It was at this
point in my reading when I answered your queries.

<p>
Secondly, apologies to everyone who made guesses on the source of my
rider's names, for most of you were accurate at least to some degree.

<p>
Then I commenced reading `The Abbot', Scott's sequel to `The
Monastery'.  In it, an orphan, Roland Graeme by name, is adopted into
Halbert Glendinning's household as a page to Mary Glendinning, nee
Avenel.  The page is spoiled and eventually let go.  He meets Catherine
Seyton, is transported to Edinburgh, interferes in a brawl on the side
of Catherine's father, and meets Murray.  Murray assigns him to the
household of .................... the deposed and `sequestered', read
`imprisoned', Queen Mary.  This, halfway through `The Abbot'.  Roland
finds Catherine in Queen Mary's service ahead of him.  After some
intrigue, Mary is freed from her imprisonment, and many of the Catholic
Barons flock to her service.  However, they are a fractious lot, and
whilst removing Mary to a `safer' location, are engaged by Murray's
smaller but better disciplined forces.  The protestant's win, Mary flees
to England, which accepts her person only - no retainers.  Roland is
revealed to be Julian's son, Julian is shown to have married Roland's
mother, Catherine Graeme, who was also nobility.  Roland and Catherine
are forgiven their involvement in the escape and insurrection, marry and
will eventually inherit Castle Avenel, as Halbert and Mary never had
children.

<p>
What of the Abbot, you ask?  Boniface had resigned, to be replaced by
Eustace.  Upon Eustace's death, Edward had been elected Abbot.  He
appears but briefly in `The Abbot', making several appearances as a
behind-the-scenes manipulator, working in favor of the Catholic
partisan, Queen Mary.

<p>
<i>((I think somewhere I had heard of <i>The Abbot</i> and that's what
came to mind.... that story of Mary in Prison (or detained,
or whatever she was).  I think they might have made a movie
(in the 50s or so) loosely based on that part of the story
too that I saw on TV as a child.))</i>

<p>
That, and my having not quite got there, would explain the
answer-almost-fits-but-not-quite scenario we played...   :)

<p>
(I.K. BRUNEL to THE REST): If you'd taken my advice and built a broad gauge 
instead of the standard gauge of 4 foot 8 inches, there would have been no 
overcrowding on square 1 last turn.

<p>
Talking of railway gauges, I received an interesting e-mail the other day 
which presumably originated on the internet. It went something like this:

<p>
1: Why do American trains run on railway tracks some 4'8" apart?

<p>
2: Because that was the standard gauge in Britain, and the first trains in the US 
were built to British designs.

<p>
1: Why did Britain use a standard gauge of 4'8"?

<p>
2: Because that was the width of the wagonways and tram (trolley bus) lines in 
Britain, which pre-dated the advent of the railways.  It meant the machines 
that had been used to produce wagons could also be used to produce train 
engines.

<p>
1:Why were the wagonways 4'8" wide?

<p>
2: Because that was the width of the ruts in British roads.  Prior to the 
invention of Tarmac, the state of British roads was so bad that the only way 
to ensure a smooth ride that would not lead to destruction of the wagon wheels 
was to use the well-worn ruts created by previous travellers.

<p>
1: Why were the ruts 4'8" apart?

<p>
2: Because that was the standard size of the wheelspan of Roman chariots, and the 
Romans built most of the early roads in Britain.  The width was roughly 
equivalent to that of two horses' arses.
Thus it can truly be said that a couple of horses' arses are responsible for 
the rail gauge used in the UK and the USA today.
But wait, there's more!  The booster engine thingies on space rockets are also 
about 4'8" in width.  They'd be a lot more efficient, apparently, were they 
bigger, but the company that makes them transports them by rail through a 
tunnel that is only 4'8" (and a bit) wide.
Thus the design of space vehicles is determined by the design of Roman 
chariots some 2,000 years ago.

<p>
(Footnote: I.K. Brunel's Great Western Railway used the much safer and more 
efficient broad gauge until forced to change by an Act of Parliament.  VHS 
defeats Betamax, Nintendo Gameboy beats the Atari Lynx, Windows proves more 
popular than Apple - it's been happening for centuries!)

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
I think we might do it with ``wings''.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Sex is a commodity, to be bought and
sold like rock `n' roll."
From ``Club Mekon'' off of <i>The Mekons Rock `n' Roll</i> album.

<p>
(BOOB to WORLD): Carry over press first.....

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG ``WELCOME HOME''): The Romulans as promised have returned
Mr. Spock and Mr. Chekov.
Mr. Chekov can't seem to wipe the smile off his face.
He looks good and has said he'll probably spend his retirement years on
Vulcan.
Spock looks a little frail and he has said he may never ever go home.
I had a conversation with Spock.  For the record:

<p>
Kirk: Welcome back!

<p>
Spock: Thank you sir!

<p>
Kirk: Congratulations on your diplomatic initiative!

<p>
Spock: Initiative?

<p>
Kirk: It has been assumed that your presence on Romulus inspired a 
pro-unification effort that led to the unraveling of the Romulan/Ferengi
alliance, the Ferengi panic and subsequent attack of Romulus.
Starfleet command is recommending you for the interstellar Nobel Prize.

<p>
Spock: I think not!

<p>
Kirk (puzzled): Why not?

<p>
Spock: Because nothing you said is true.
I spent all of my time locked up with Chekov.
I didn't even meet with my pro-unification allies until after I was released.

<p>
Kirk (even more puzzled): Do you have any idea why the Ferengi betrayed the
Romulans to join the Cardassians?

<p>
Spock: To put it in human terms, ``the Romulans' check bounced''.

<p>
Kirk: Maybe I should turn on my universal translator.

<p>
Spock: That won't be necessary, I'll explain.
The Ferengi market was always split as to the decision to merge with Romulus.
The Romulans had to bribe a Ferengi top level executive to seal the alliance.
The transfer was handled by a midlevel Ferengi administrator who is an
expert Dabo Game gambler.
He had an arrangement with a Dabo girl (Ferengi prostitute) to 
fix the numbers on the Dabo Game wheel.
When the administrator would receive the Romulan bribe money, he 
would go to the casino and make a killing at the Dabo wheel
before he would transfer the bribe.
The casino authorities got suspicious and interrogated the girl.
She gave up the administrator but was unaware of the Romulan 
connection.
The Ferengi casino had the Dabo wheel reset and the girl led the
administrator to lose the bribe money and all of his subsequent
winnings back to the casino.
When the Ferengi top level executive failed to receive his
monthly bribe, he took it as a prelude to a Romulan invasion, 
so he got together with the Cardassians to attack Romulus.
Why they never contacted the Federation on the verge of collapse
is still a mystery.

<p>
Kirk (pausing in disappointment): So, what you are saying, Spock,
is that the United Federation of Planets was saved from annihilation
by a Dabo prostitute, a corrupt Ferengi administrator, and a 
superparanoid Ferengi chief executive?

<p>
Spock: That is essentially correct!

<p>
Kirk: Spock, if it's all the same to you, I'm going to change
the log and go with the Vulcan/Romulan reunification story!

<p>
Spock: As you wish, Captain.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): What do you think of Babylon 5?
I think it is the best science fiction series ever.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to JEFF): I've commented on that before in various places.
I really, really found the first season or two of Babylon 5 extremely
annoying, especially what I saw as badly written dialogue.
The key underlying plot line between the Shadows and the other super
long=lived races as it finally developed was far more interesting
than that, but still suffered from the ``take a complex group of 
traits and let each race take one of them to a nauseatingly 
extreme position!'' science fiction syndrome.
I would think that any adaptable and diverse race would have clearly
dominated things in the Babylon 5 universe.
So, anyway, while I do think it finally turned into a watchable series,
I never was really hooked.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): Kim Cattrall; wow!
I'll give you that one.
I mean, I know Vulcans only mate once every seven years but she'd be
worth the wait.
I forgot about her.
<i>((How could you do that??))</i>
You never mention Yeoman Rand.
She is at the top of the list too.
<i>((I don't dispute Grace Lee Whitney....))</i>

<p>
(KIRK to STARFLEET): I got an unusual message from ``Q''.
It seems the Continuum is having a ``Q Contest'' to determine
who's the best ``Q'' and to see which race is the best at
dealing with ``Q''.
I received my ballot.
All of the ``Q's'' listed are unfamiliar to me.
All of the races listed are from other galaxies or alternate realities.
I'll vote but I have no idea what I'm doing (kinda like our war effort).

<p>
(SPAIN-BRITAIN): Change of plans, do as you see fit.

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Let's take him.

<p>
(SPAIN-UKRAINE): Let's also take him.

<p>
(PARAMOUNT NETWORK to TREK FANS): ``Both of them''.
We postponed last week's episode of ``Star Trek'' to bring you
the wonderful world of Heidi.
We hope you enjoyed.....
