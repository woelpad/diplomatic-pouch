This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Let's get the new Diplomacy game going.
Since Doug may be winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

I think most of you have seen it, but David Hill's article on being
smoked at World DipCon (see: 
http://grantland.com/features/diplomacy-the-board-game-of-the-alpha-nerds/)
has been generating lots of commentary, along with the appearance on

<i>((If anyone from <i>TAP</i> or <i>ES</i> has ideas 
for more things to talk about here let me know.
I do have five or six ideas lined up here already that I just have to write.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, you will recall that I wrote these words a few issues ago about my
nephew-in law Mark Abraham's band Enter the Haggis: "pondering this question 
about whether they want to keep being a rock and roll band or a roots band."
I hadn't talked to Mark about this, but when I did a few months ago, he
admitted that they'd been pondering it and that they decided to change
their name to release their new record. 
This would cement their move to being a rock band.
I didn't say anything about it last issue since I didn't want to be a leak
source, but a few weeks ago they broke the news on their facebook
page that they are now Jubilee Riots.
It is a fascinating problem, you start a band, play Irish/Scottish tinged
music with bagpipes, and name your band something very specific.
But you grow and change, and when you really become a rock band, the name
holds you back.
I think they made the right decision to change the name, you can see their
web site or facebook page.  This article I also liked:
http://961wodz.com/enter-the-haggis-is-jubilee-riots/?trackback=fbshare.
The big issue though is all those people who tattooed ETH on their bodies...
oh well, just another reason why tattooing is so interesting, and so
risky. 
The more things change... the more they change.
I'll review the new record and say a bit more in a few issues.
Up next issue, Ghod is touring the US with his new acoustic album,
see where Richard Thompson is appearing near you and go!))</i>

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
And then I could have soloed the second game, but well, I can't exactly 
say how I did it, but the Canadian player soloed there, with help from me.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals SHOULD start 
soon, everyone has been queried.
But you also still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!
Word is we may cancel them, I think the finals should reignite interest.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) We have a game start.  The players have been notified, Tom Howell (the BNC) has given
us a number (the first of the year), and we even have some Winter 1900 press.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The game is a memorial for the late Don Williams.  The 57 comes from our shared ages,
I turn 57 next week and Don would have turned 57 precisely a month earlier on August 29.
I expect press will take the 57 number in all sorts of directions.
I'd like this to be a good press game, let's see if we can keep up the good Winter 1900 
start.
Reminder, press around here is black, let me know if any other house rules need
explaining.
Most of this press was in "E-Mail to all".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILL ABBOTT, GERMANY) I never had the honor of playing with Don Williams. 
I have not appeared often in the pages of <i>TAP</i>. 
Nonetheless, I avidly read <i>TAP</i> when it comes out, even the game reports. 
The games with Don were usually the ones with the most entertaining press. 
Even in the items he did not write, he was often a leading character, 
and he seemed to bring out creativity in others. I can only hope to write press as entertaining as that which I read in his games. 
I also encourage my fellow players to strive for this level.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I strongly believe that Diplomacy can be a spectator game. 
I have been around the championship game at Gencon several times, 
and it always attracts not only other players from the tournament, 
but wandering gamers who may not have played for years, or ever. 
I find the showcase games in Diplomacy World, with their commentary, 
extremely interesting and entertaining. In a game like this, 
without the commentators, the best way to make it a spectator game is through press. 
The readers can't see our negotiations, but we can make it a 
fun game for them by entertaining them in the public press.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRED): Is Heinz 57 sponsoring this game?
A year's worth of the red stuff?
Seriously, bless Don - was in a number of games with him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PAUL to FRED): We could use Heinz 57 to simulate "blood" if you want to....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KOBLENZ, GERMANY) The town is draped in black. The anarchist organization, 
the Black Spleen, successfully assassinated every living Hohenzollern. 
The resilience of the German Empire, though tested, was not broken: 
the Imperial Guard rounded up the entire organization. Most are no longer 
among the living. The remainder envy the dead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yet what is an empire without an emperor? Various relatives of the late 
Kaiser Wilhelm II remained among the royal houses of Europe, especially 
in Britain and Russia. Yet the princes of the various German states, while 
they might consent to the rule of another German, 
were more likely to choose independence over rule by a foreign house. 
The unity of the empire demanded a German on the throne. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But which German? Prussia would never accept one of the princes of the 
southern German states, let alone a pretender to a throne they 
extinguished before 1870. And so the Imperial Government was 
looking everywhere for someone to put on the throne. A pedigree was not necessary; 
papers showing an appropriate lineage could be easily forged.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And so, three agents of the office of the Imperial Chamberlain are standing 
on a doorstep in a small city of the West Prussian Rhineland. 
The name above the door says, "Fedewa". They knock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Gruess dich. Wie kann ich Sie helfen?" Greetings. How can I help you?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Ist Wilhelm hier?" Is Wilhelm here?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Ja, Ich bin." Yes, that's I.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Kommen Sie bitte mit uns. Sie sind der neue Kaisar unseres Volk." 
Come with us, Sire. You are our people's new Caesar.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILL): I am honored to be in this game honoring Don Williams, 
and to be playing against such esteemed players. 
I only ask that you keep your knives sharp, as that will make 
your stabs simple and painless. :-)
It might be interesting to work the number 57 into any ongoing press storylines. 
Also it might be interesting to work in references to Don.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PAUL to WILL): You are asking me to stab you?  I have been known to stab 
people "long distance" (diplomatically) - essentially "playing the board" - 
but I don't like doing it in a knee-jerk manner.  Really!  
But if you want a knife in the back... well, you can ask.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MELINDA): *takes a deep breath*  *slowly looks at the opposition*  *evil smile*
"Let the games begin".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MARK): I am honored to be in a game named after Don, what a great guy!   
You guys (and lady) on the other hand... 
are a bunch of scoundrels, cutthroats of the highest order... 
in other words, my kind (and Don's) of people!
Looking forward to this one!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DAVID to MARK): Scoundrel... Cutthroat... Thanks for the compliment!  
That's the nicest thing anyone has called me in a while...

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The DIAS game ending proposal failed.  
New draw proposals, to vote with your Winter orders are:
DIAS, EF, EFR, and concession to E. 
If more than one proposal passes, the SMALLEST one that passes goes.
If you fail to vote, you veto any proposal you do not vote on.
Methinks there are changes afoot, but that's up to you all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Still send all good thoughts to Heath Gardner, but he is doing a bit better.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA -– ALL): At least if I was in some forest and 
I fell a tree would hear me.  
This is more like starring in Alien...in this game no one can hear you scream.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JAMES to WORLD):  OK, who didn't vote for the DIAS?  Seriously?  
OK, I guess we are going to keep playing.  I'm good with that...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MOSCOW -– WORLD): Maybe if I just veto every draw and try to screw 
this game up as long as I can, SOMEONE will reply to my emails.  
But, I doubt it.  Sack McHugh gets more emails in a true Gunboat game than I do here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JAMES to JIM):  Am I the last of the original 7 in the game?  
Exactly when did this game start anyways?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JAMES): Not at all, more than half the players are original.
My brother David and Johnny Crow each have been in this since the beginning
as well, which was September of 2006.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Wow, no one replenished above a total of 17, and two of you had the minimum
replenishment of 12.  When will the pack reform, or will it?
Remember that the next Sprint Line is at 80 (getting to 81 to score).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to RIDERS): You CAN write press, you know, even if it is to yell at Rick
as he pedals out of sight.

Kendo Nagasaki games in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> 
continue to multiply like weeds...
I'd like to get more people engaged here, not just the usual suspects from Doug's games.
The full rules for Where in the World is Kendo Nagasaki are
in: http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/es58.pdf.
The player who was closest for Turn 8 has been notified by E-Mail.
Note that the official rules say you're supposed to get this by TURN 10,
time to get a bit closer on WHO Kendo is.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
The deadline for <i>Diplomacy World</i> is coming up at the end of September.
Can I inquire if we can get some more interest in writers to write things for it?
Someone seems to have awakened Larry Peery and reignited the monster.
If it was you, can you please try to write as much as he writes?
Even if it wasn't you, how about trying to write us something.
Of course, we all know that notes like these in my last word essentially have no effect.
But prove me wrong.
The International Diplomacy Hobby is really heating up, if you've never been to
a Diplomacy convention in Europe, think about making a caravan trip over there to 
partake of the joys of FTF Dip in another country.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
More locally, we are trying to organize a local house game.  Is anyone who is close to 
me or Boston willing to get together to play?  I think it is time for the fifth 
reinvention of the local New England hobby.
Come on, I know some of you are close, E-Mail me and join us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Last note: keep thinking good thoughts about Heath Gardner as he fights through his
troubles.</b>
