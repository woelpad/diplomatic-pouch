<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What if they gave a baseball season and Summer decided to not show up?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The good news is that it looks like we could be talking about the 
Bruins and Blackhawks well into June.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The bad news is that they might be able to play the Stanley Cup Finals 
in outdoor games at Wrigley and Fenway.  
Actually, given the Cubs' and Red Sox' predicted fortunes that might 
be good news.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So where do we start this year?

<br /><br /><i>((OK, so what do I have to say about this year of baseball?  
I have always been a "the enforcement of the rules on PEDs are the 
enforcement of the rules" guy.  
I think the baseball writers are some of the most hypocritical
lame writers on the planet if they won't vote for anyone for the 
HOF who they wrote positively on when they were playing and refused 
to see the glaring evidence in their faces.  
Within the power of the baseball writers
was to force an end to the PED era.  
But they were enjoying the HRs too much.  Period.  
Nevertheless, A-Rod's physical problems could not be
happening to a more deserving guy, and you all saw where 
Manny is playing right?  Yeah.  Are PEDs out of baseball now?  
Of course not, though they are less pervasive, and it seems that 
those still using, like A-Rod, are mostly reaping the downside of PEDs.  
Yet, eternal optimist that I am, I really am looking forward to a 
great season of baseball this year!  Who do I think will prevail?))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL East: I think this "love of the Blue Jays" is way out of line.  
Did they see how these players screwed up the other teams 
they were on before?
But they still have enough talent to finish third.  
And the Red Sox don't have enough hitting, but they DO have 
enough pitching, the second best
pitching in the toughest division in baseball, behind the Rays.  
So, that's the order.  Rays, Red Sox (WILD CARD), Blue Jays, Orioles,
Yankees, but only 13 games separating top to bottom in the division.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL Central: Tigers, Indians (Yes, Tito IS a good manager), Royals, 
White Sox, and Twins are useless in last.  
The Tigers are the class of the
American League and it will be fun with such great managers going up
against each other.  
The Indians don't have the talent to win, but they have the talent 
to make it fun.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL West: Rangers and then the Angels yet again, taking the second WC.
The A's magic is only enough to be third.  
Then a big jump to the Mariners, and finally the
Astros, who aspire to be the worst team in baseball again now, BUT watch
out in three years.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Tigers and Red Sox go to the ALCS, and Tigers win.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL East: Everyone thinks the Nationals go for it again, history suggests
some regression to the mean and a WC spot.  I really like the Braves team.
So Braves, then Nationals, then Phillies, then Mets, and the other team
that wants to be last, the Marlins, taking up the rear.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL Central: Cardinals surprise and beat out the Reds, with both teams
doing poorly enough so the Reds don't get the WC.  Then Pirates, then
Brewers, finally Cubs, another team playing for three years from now.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL West: Giants, then Dodgers as WC, Diamondbacks, Padres, and Rockies
take up the rear.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Playoffs: Giants and Braves come through to play in NLCS, and the Giants
win again as Tim Lincecum makes a brilliant comeback.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Giants repeat World Series.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((A-Rod is waived by the Yankees, they keep paying people to try to get out
of the basement and spend $300 million.  Verlander and Lester vie for Cy
Young in the AL, a Nationals pitcher does NOT win it in the NL, probably a
Phillies pitcher wins it, if Lincecum doesn't.  MVP is Miguel Cabrera in
the AL, unless it is Longoria; NL I am tempted to take PED superstar Ryan
Braun, but bet he gets injured and Bryce Harper surprises here.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I'm looking forward to it!))</i>

<br /><br /> <b>Rick Desper (Sat, 30 Mar 2013 20:19:28 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You're picking the Yankees for last?
<i>((Why not??))</i>
Well I guess that's not as weird as picking the Blue Jays to finish ahead 
of and behind the Red Sox.
<i>((Yeah, I fixed that typo above.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: Rays, Yankees (WC), Orioles, Red Sox, Jays
really, I have no idea.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: Tigers, White Sox, Indians, Royals, Twins

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: Angles, Strangers, Aaaas, Mariners

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: Nats, Braves (WC), others

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: Reds, Brewers, Cardinals, bad teams

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: Giants, Dodgers, whatever

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim is pretty badly wrong about the Nats, who have the best pitching in the NL.
Strasburg should be able to give the team an entire season this year. 
Regression to the mean doesn't mean that the team with the best run differential 
should suddenly get worse. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((UPDATE at Press Time: As of this date, my predictions for the NL East
are right on... we'll see how it goes for the rest of the season.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OTOH, the Orioles are likely in trouble, since regression to the mean 
does mean that a team that won an unusually large number of close
games is likely to lose more. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll randomly pick an Angels-Nats WS, that the Nats win.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Red Sox are not going to make a huge comeback this year. 
Some of the pitchers should rebound under Farrell's management, 
but others won't, most notably Lackey, who is about five years removed 
from being a strong starter. 
But Lester and Buchholz will be good. 
Too bad they don't have any good young power hitters. 
Well, I suppose they had to let Adrian Gonzalez go to get rid of two hideous 
contracts (Crawford and Beckett).

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Sun, 31 Mar 2013 19:30:37 -0400 (EDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So in a very unpredictable year it surprises me that my predictions 
really aren't all that different from either Rick or Jim-Bob.
For a change I see a leveling of the playing field, and for a change
I see a lot more teams in it.
I did have to alter my philosophy of picking teams that spend the most 
money to picking the teams that spend the most money to players who will 
actually be playing, and playing for those teams paying them...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: Sitting down?
I think NEITHER the Yankees or Red Sox make the playoffs.
In fact I think that, to their eventual detriment, the Yankees stay close 
enough in a very down division to NOT be sellers at the deadline, 
even though they should be.
I'm not sold on the Blue Jays either, but I am on the Orioles.
Baltimore, Tampa Bay, Toronto, NY Yankees, Boston.
NO wild card from this division.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: Ok, it's Detroit and then everyone else.
But some of those everyone else's aren't bad, Twins excepted.
Detroit, Cleveland (WC), Chicago, Kansas City, Minnesota.
Royals get to 80-82 by losing their last 6 games, after being 
in it most of the year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: The Astros move took 4 wins away from each of the other NL Central 
teams and gave them to the AL West.
They might have BOTH wild cards, but I'll take Los Angeles, Texas (WC), 
Oakland, Seattle, Lastros.
Is that trademarked?
Houston could break the record for futility this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: I think the Nationals come together BETTER than last year, 
and might wind up with the best record after 162.
Washington, Atlanta (WC), Philadelphia, NY Mets, Florida.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: The only division worse than the AL East. 
Cards are down, Brewers are down.
Pittsburgh can't get enough wins without Houston.
Cincinnati, Milwaukee, St. Louis (below .500), Pittsburgh, Chicago.
My Cubs are better than last year's 61-101...so make it 67-95.
Tell me about this Theo guy again?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, well, we'll see, won't we??
We in Boston think we're doing just fine without Theo.
I like him as a guy, but maybe he really isn't such a good GM?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: 3 legitimate WS contenders.
Here I think the Giants take the dive far enough to miss the playoffs.
Los Angeles, Arizona (WC), San Francisco, San Diego, Colorado.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS: Tigers over Angels.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS: Dodgers over Nationals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS: Detroit.

<br /><br />This is also the first tournament in the regional sub-Grand Prix tournament 
that is in its fifth year that we've dubbed the "Nor'Easter".  
The next tournament in that group is the new Philly Massacre in Philadelphia the
first weekend of July;
the new NYC/Brooklyn con in September; and Carnage, November 8-10 in Vermont,
now at Killington. 
We will again have a First Place Nor'Easter prize to be awarded and with more help from
Robert Rousse (Carnage co-organizer) we should have Second and Third Place prizes as well.  
More on that to come.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Drop Dead Time Deadlines: These worked like a charm as usually, this is the way to play
tournament dip, you're always moving, no waiting around while people write orders.  
The games really moved along, I again used my loud voice with reminders to people 
as needed, and people respected other players' space with need for order writing time.  
And the atmosphere was great.  I ended up going again with the 17 minute spring, 15 minute 
fall continually running clock that gives more time for beer after the games.    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
More experience on selling Diplomacy on site: I was still not as successful as
I would like to be here.  I was very careful to post notes on the game forums on the 
web site so that people knew we were there. These generated discussions but only
one actual player.  I did a lot of my usual tricks, trying direct 
E-Mails to Judge players and other players I could identify as being in the area, 
this again was not successful, but I will keep trying again.  
I didn't try walking around the Con playing Edi Birsan's 
Teaching Videos from You Tube again like I did a few years ago.... don't believe me, yes, 
I really, really did this a few times, but it didn't really gain anything but laughs,
especially from the miniatures players, so I didn't do that this time around.

doesn't get the travelers that it might.  We all agree that an early year northeastern
tournament is a good idea, but we wondered if we should have just held it ourselves
outside of a gaming convention.  We will continue that discussion as the year progresses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some time I'd like to run a DipCon or World DipCon, but that probably won't be able to be at 
TempleCon.

<b>DIPLOMACY WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT IS ONGOING - YOU CAN STILL JOIN!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started in January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my next game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

 Standby lists:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mike Barno, Dick Martin, Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Glenn
Petroski, Steve Emmert, Mark Kinney, Vince Lutterbie, Eric Brosius,
Paul Rauterberg, Bob Osuch, Doug Kent, Sean O'Donnell,
Heath Gardner, Paul Kenny, and Jeff O'Donnell
stand by for regular Diplomacy.
Let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF given the new policies.

I'm going to start the game opening list over.  Under the new regime, who wants to
play?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
DIPLOMACY: First off, another regular Diplomacy game is open.  Doug Kent and Brad
Wilson are in, anyone else?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BREAKING AWAY: Also, a new Breaking Away game is open. 
Currently Andy York is on board.
This is the game I really like running and want to start another one.
It's easy, very low maintenance.

1) Congratulations, Al, for sticking this
out to the solo!!!
I'll have a Supply Center Chart next time and I still am interested in
endgame statements.
I know this has been hanging for a while, and I might have some endgame statements in
hand, if you think you sent one and you're unsure if I have it, check with me.
