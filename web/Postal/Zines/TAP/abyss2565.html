<p><br><p><br>AN OCCASIONAL ERRATA ISSUE: Well, there goes the idea of setting a deadline
for myself and sticking to it no matter what. 
I wanted to get the last issue out BEFORE the NCAA Basketball Tournament
Sweet Sixteen games started.
I was not watching or listening or monitoring on the Internet, but I knew
that the first two games had started, including the game that Duke ultimately
would lose as I was writing out notes trashing Duke's chances, and that
it already was late in the first half of those games.
I rushed the issue out, posted it on the web page, E-Mailed it to the
list, and printed the text.
I grabbed blank copies of the maps and ran out to my car for the hour
drive home as I would get to listen to the Duke/Indiana game
on the trip.
I listened to Duke's collapse and Indiana's comeback and then when
I got home tried to fill out the maps and spotted my mistakes in 
Fantastic Voyage.
Whoops.
I had partly adjudicated the game with only some of the orders in
awhile back and had not returned to finish it up after dropping the
other orders into the game.
I did not spot my mistake in Fear and Whiskey until David Partridge
E-Mailed me to point it out.  
There, I adjudicated it correctly, but forgot to put some of John
Schultz' orders in the szine.
While we could wait until Summer (which still goes ahead in both games
as scheduled), I thought I would put out this revision, along with
a reiteration of my support for Maryland in tomorrow night's NCAA final.
After screwing up a lot of other picks, it would be nice to have
the final winner right from the beginning.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Buddy complained about me not underlining orders which fail of
execution, rather than italicizing them, which is not visible 
on E-Mail, but is visible on the Web and in print.
The problem is that TeX (the program I use to print the szine)
makes it very, very hard to underline text.
So, put simply, I can't do it, or perhaps more accurately
I won't do it.
I still am using the lower case ``s'' instead of the upper case
``S'' for support orders that are cut or fail, as Mike Barno
previously had suggested to me.
I'm sorry that isn't easier to see than it might be.

<p>
2) The main thing that happens here, once all of the orders are submitted
and entered correctly, is that Turkey cuts the support of the convoyed
attack on Tuscany, and Austria doesn't manage to get out of Tuscany
to permit the move to go unsupported.
Then the move from the Mid-Atlantic can't go since Spain is not 
vacated.
Sorry about that!

1) I adjudicated correctly, but forgot to record John's moves in the north.
Everything was right on the map and now is right in the orders.
Sorry about that!
