<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website when diplom.org is back up.
Yes, you are NOT dreaming, the whole site unfortunately presently is unavailable, but
we WILL get it back up.
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> which is running down to a fold.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: /Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html (still disabled)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />YOU can still join Kendo Nagasaki, hop in!!!
But it's ALMOST over...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i> in
<i>NSWG</i> #16, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  
Since Terry's passing, we lose our thirty year fervent hope that someday <i>NSWG</i>
would have been resurrected and I could go back and swear my fealty to the Toadfather.
The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more,
especially when I feel better.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I'm having trouble with the upload interfaces, part of the 
diplom.org site move consequences.  I'll get it fixed as soon as I can.
I need to stay within the security of the site (which is very important!!!!)
while getting access to change the web site's index and files for the szine.
It shouldn't be that hard, but my first, second, and third attempts didn't work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The website address is still:
/.
I had a glitch in the webpage update process, but I hope that will be fixed when
the site as a whole comes back.  I was hoping to provide an update today, but as
I write, I STILL don't really have one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 77 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, which is
starting to come back up, I hope.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the current list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
I'm trying to add some of the newer subscribers who aren't there. 
It's really easy, just click on that link or copy and paste it into your browser. 
If you have questions or problems, PLEASE ask.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, I see that does help.
Please let me know about other issues, but it puts priority on getting the link up again.
Apologies for the recent confusions.

<i>((For upcoming cons around the world: /Face/cons/index.php, 
success, we have badgered all the Con directors to post their Cons, so it is reasonably
up to date now.
And there remains lots of interest in the FTF community, and linking E-Mail/Web players
to FTF.  
Also, the Facebook page for European Tournament Diplomacy, https://www.facebook.com/groups/1500292310187264/,
Diplomacy in Europe, has been really active and the place to be in the hobby these days.
If you're on Facebook, hook up there!
The Nor'Easter sequence of four tournaments will be continuing next year, culminating in
North American DipCon this next year at Carnage in Vermont!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Remember that I'm leading TotalCon again, which has MOVED!  TotalCon will be February 24-26, 2017
at Best Western Royal Plaza Hotel, 181 Boston Post Road West, Marlborough, MA.  For those following closely,
this is basically where the Boston tournament was last year, before Randy and Alan Levin moved it to 
Cambridge.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
TotalCon is New England's largest general gaming convention and is one of the places that we as a hobby 
reach out and make the Diplomacy tournament circuit known to other gamers.  We picked up quite a host
of brand new players last year, and expect to do more of that this year.  
Thanks to the entire TotalCon staff for their hospitality and helpfulness.
The Rounds will be: Round 1 on Friday night at 7PM, Round 2 at 10AM on Saturday morning, Round 3 at 7PM on
Saturday, and Round 4 at 1PM on Sunday, with an ending by 5PM.  The first three rounds are unlimited in length.
Please think about making plans to come.
Pre-registration for the whole weekend is 65 dollars or 75 dollars at the door.  
But we do have a special 50 dollar deal for this convention!
Check with me if you're coming to make sure you get this great deal, which includes a 15 dollar voucher!!!
I will be having two crash rooms with pay what you can, feel free to start reserving your spot now!
Brad Blitstein was first to claim a spot.
Commitments are slow, any of you interested in coming???))</i>

I'd love to do another game of Spy Diplomacy, but it requires commitment that seems in short supply.
Especially with Doug Kent bowing out, is there some other Variant in which there is interest?
Please ask!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
REGULAR DIPLOMACY: Two games continue.
Is there something else we want to start?
I have some ideas on how to do "By Popular Demand" differently...
Let's see if there is interest in a new regular game.
Signups please?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BREAKING AWAY: 
I will start a new game after next issue, Andy Bate was first to sign up.
There also is interest from others, can we get that nailed down for next issue?
I was warned about a game with seven players, but I liked the way this one came off,
so we will be looking for six or seven, and I'm inclined to do another game with seven
if we can find enough of you interested.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I moved everyone, but we're done, so I didn't do any replenishment.
Brendan Whyte kicked butt in placement so he was most efficient in his
replenishments.
Note that Rick also was pretty efficient with his replenishments leading to points.
Hank Alme was least efficient.
And some of you (not naming you) really had some pretty shocking numbers of
your riders getting dropped.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Lots of you signed up for the next game, I'll do some checking for next time and see if we can get
started again quickly.
Other TAP players who want to play also should let me know by February's deadline!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Official order of finish is: <b>Brendan Whyte, Rick Desper, Jim Reader (each of these three JUST
a POINT apart!!!), Marc Ellinger, Andy York, Hank Alme, and Andy Bate.</b>

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
So, cancer treatment remains just as much fun as you think it would be.  My back pain remains bad only just before
I take medication, which works. 
I'm also completely off the opioid medication - like everyone who does this, I sort of just figured out taking myself
off it on my own.
This is a problem in our field - I study this stuff partly for my work, and I still was not feeling comfortable with the procsss.
What happens to people less knowledgeable?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My treatment also is causing lots of skin problems, I'm not good with fixing that, but with great help from Charlotte,
I'm really staying ahead of that.  The worst remains the digestive problems which cause me difficulty in gaining weight.
I try and try, but you only can eat so much, and I don't think my body processes it all.  
Well anyway, you keep fighting forward and this is probably too stark in black and white.
My attitude remains good and my oncologist thinks I'm a dream patient.
I'd like to be a dream patient who survives.... ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm trying to push this out the door to get into Doug Kent's szine.... so I didn't draw maps this time.  Go back to last
issue and I'll try to be better about maps for next time.  I'm just going to leave half a page blank and get this out
so Doug has it...</b>
