<p><br><p><br>This issue is dedicated to Gary Coughlan, longtime publisher of the
hobby megaszine <i>Europa Express</i> and to the memory of Gary's
father.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I think we should be back on track for the new year now!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are preparing to ``take over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
As Michael Lowrey already has announced, <i>Carolina Command and Commentary</i>
will be opening a Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
This will give me better coverage of the Dixie hobby and provide Michael a 
congenial place from which to publish.
Don Williams' new subzinny appears below, but he already has had a 
defection from this stunning collection of retread old farts in that
the great and powerful Steve Langley has decided that his karma
would be reduced by conducting Diplomacy negotiations.
My karma is still much increased by continuing to keep you guys
on the mailing list for the szine though!

<p>

<p>
the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen's more extensive efforts at (note the new address):

The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (in a MUCH, MUCH improved way!)
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
John and Kathy Caruso are now up on E-Mail and if David responded to the
pressure from Dickie poo Martin to update the page recently!
I'm going to have a tanking rebuilding year myself.

<p>
2) For the most recent issue of Pete Sullivan's subszine 
check out (this address will be changing shortly):

Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARK BERCH</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>A number of people have tried to contact Mark, but none have hit paydirt
yet.  I hope this one will be solved very quickly!!

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
Jim; I'm again impressed by the breadth of your knowledge, experience and 
publishing acumen.  Another great issue.  Thank you.  Soon Saddam will 
be over and you can finally stop sending me the zine by snail.
    
<p>
I had not realized that <i>Tinamou</i> had come out with an issue, and so 
missed your comments about Milk and Cookies.  My hat is off to someone 
as venerable as you are who can still think clearly, type, and does not 
appear to rely upon Depends.  Your experience with Snowball Fighting 
goes nearly to the Big Bang.  Yes, we are all star stuff.  (I went to 
the Hayden Planetarium in Central Park the day of the NY Marathon.  When 
I was a wee lad I went, and believed my brothers that the dome 
retracted, and even though it was daytime when we went in, that they 
blacked out the sky so that we could see the starts.  I don't think I 
would have had any greater trouble believing them now that I was taken 
back to the big bang.  Anyway, one of the quotes in the presentation is 
that we are all composed of ``star stuff."  Heady.)
    
<p>
So, we shall play snowball fighting again.  Reducing the dirigible 
factor.  That's good.  No reason why one strategy should take 
predominance, including being somehow less fun.  Sort of as if Diplomacy 
had been designed with Turkey starting with 4 SC's.

<p>
Jim Boob, I got <i>TAP</i> #240  last week. 
Hey Happy Xmas and Merry New Year to you too. 

<p>
So you got me involved in this World Masters Diplomacy Tournament
and you don't even mention my game???!! Geez, after I agree to pick up a
stand by position you wouldn't even take, that's gratitude for ya. Us Hobby
Phoobahs gets no respect. Is the game in your szine the one you are running
in the WMT tourney or what?
<i>((Actually NO, it is NOT in the tourney itself.
It is a ``challenge'' game amongst some of the popular low lifes (heh, heh, hee)
from past tourney years.
I've mentioned you now, happy??))</i>

<p>
How come you feel closer to the Brits than the US hobby lately? We
don't even feud anymore. I like that title by the way, the ``Amateur PBM Zine
Poll." Does that mean there is a ``Professional" poll lurking about
somewhere?
<i>((Sort of, this was done, I believe, to keep some of the professional
game publishers out of that poll.
This was a problem in the 1980's or so for them(?).
One of the Brits should feel free to enlighten Jack more definitively.))</i>

<p>
I'm not surprised that the AI for a computer diplomacy game isn't
very good. Most computer wargames have the same problem. Diplomacy makes it
worse because you'd have SIX computer AI instead of just one.  The only
computer game based on an old AH game that seems to work is the one for
1835. I suspect that has to do with the mathematically basis of a stock game
and the lack of any dice or other unforeseen events in the game.

<p>
I'm considering going to DipCon XXXIV because of Manus Hand's
letter. Anyone that enthusiastic deserves some response, even if I am
cynical enough to still be appalled(!) by that enthusiasm. Are you going
JimBob?
<i>((No, but don't let me hinder you in any way, GO!!!))</i>

<p>
I like Goz's comments, but I have to say I did like where A-Rod
ended up. The only team I like in Texas is the Rangers. They remind me of a
mid-west version of the Phillies. People talk about the Cubs and Cleveland,
but those teams having nothing on the Phillies, a 100 year history and five
trips to the World Series, 1915, 1950, 1983, 1993 and one world championship
in 1980. That's like a slow decade for the Yankees.

<p>
Anyway, I've given up on major league baseball. The games are far
too long and there's no strategy left in the game. One or two Earl Weavers
is interesting, 28 is a bore. Every game is about waiting for two walks and
homerun. Between the body armor that batters wear so they can crowd the
plate to the tiny strike zone to the constant expansion of the league (thus
watering down the talent pool), it's amazing that pitching is still
considered a separate position. 

<p>
There are two power pitchers left (Martinez and Johnson) the Braves staff
that gets a pass from the league umpires (a.k.a. the Umpires Strike Back,
coming soon to be in a stadium near you) and then everyone else. The strike
zone gets any smaller you'll need a large screen TV just to see it.

<p>
The only good thing is around here there are several minor league
teams to choose from. Camden, Harrisburg, Reading, Trenton, Wilmington all
have minor league franchises. Cheap beer, cheap parking, good baseball..sign
me up.

<p>
I found your election analysis interesting. As I said in my last
letter, neither of these candidates strikes me as particularly worthy of the
office so their inability to put the country before their own ambition was
about what expected. Having watched these two in action made me wish, oddly
enough, for a candidate with Nixon's willingness to put country before
politics. 

<p>
As I'm sure you know he conceded the 1960 election to Kennedy despite
knowledge that it was stolen by Mayor Daley in Chicago and LBJ in Texas.
Still Nixon refused to fight the results feeling it would damage the country
by eroding the President's ability to govern as well as Nixon's own stature.
Certainly both candidates have proved Nixon correct on that score.

<p>
I still think it matters little which candidate wins. The Congress
is deadlocked, which means lots of boondoggle spending for voters back home
assuming you're in the right interest groups and neither candidate
articulate much of a different vision. The media actually got the election
right in the beginning by saying the candidates were virtually identical.

<p>
After the conventions when the polls began to come together, i.e.
each candidate got a convention bounce and then lost it, the media began to
push the idea of ``differences" among the candidates. This of course was a
joke that the media used to basically get interest up in a close election.
The fact that the candidates couldn't be told apart was, to the media,
irrelevant. And all this bogus soul searching by the networks over getting
the election wrong, I'm sure they cried all the way to the bank with their
huge ratings. I'm sure they usually get tens of millions of people watching
network TV on a week night after 1 a.m.

<i>((Next up, Rick Desper comments on the resignation of
Rick Pitino as Coach and GM of the Boston Celtics....
Ricky P's Travelling Salvation Show heads for the next
stop - could it be the bright lights of Las Vegas??))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Sun, 7 Jan 2001 13:31:22 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
Now let's hope the C's can undo the damage he's done to the team
relatively quickly.  Peter May is really down on some of the
personnel they have, most notably Kenny Anderson, Vitaly Potapenko, 
Tony Battie, and Eric Williams.  But at least they aren't stuck
with Pervis Ellison any longer!

<p>
I think Battie is a functional center or forward, but of course
they need another player to play ahead of him.  The Potapenko trade
was Pitino's worse, esp. as Andre Miller has developed into the type
of point guard that Kenny A. isn't anymore.  Pitino has made
countless bad trades.  The ex-Celtics (Wesley, Fox, Mercer, Billups)
seem to be doing well.  

<p>
What do the Celtics have?  Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce, and not
much else.  One ESPN writer mused the idea of a  three-way trade
which would jettison Walker and bring in Vin Baker.  This is a
horrible idea.  The last thing the C's need is Vin Baker and his
attitude.  
Walker at least works hard.  The C's need a center (who doesn't?)
a strong power forward, a quick young point guard and a bench.
They have a great shooting guard, a talented small forward with
passing and rebounding skills, a reasonably good backup power forward
who starts at center (Battie) and an overrated point guard.  

<p>
Are they better off than they were when Pitino arrived?  Possibly,
but only marginally, if that.  Walker has not developed a lot under
Pitino's tutelage.  Pierce was a great acquisition, but everything
else Pitino has tried to do has backfired.  I'm glad to see him go.

<p>
The only good thing is that they have a lot of draft picks.  Of
course, that was also true a few years ago.  But they really are not
a playoff team, nor are they even close.  

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Rick, rick_desper of yahoo.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((Indeed, though Interim Replacement Jim O'Brien is making
good progress with more of a set lineup (two players at Center
[including new starter Mark Blount],
Antoine playing essentially the whole game at Power Forward
[with a couple of blow minutes for first round draft pick
Jerome Moiso],
three players led by Pierce [and including Eric Williams] 
rotating at the 2 and the 3, and two players at the point).
Unfortunately none of those players are David Wesley or 
Rick Fox (when ML Carr TOLD Pitino that these were THE two
players he should keep at the beginning and Pitino jettisoned
to sign.... Travis Knight!!).  While you are correct that Pitino
could have hung onto the pick that became a very talented
Andre Miller, and David Wesley is now playing the off-guard
in Carolina,
I think keeping Wesley might have kept Bobby Phills alive
and been better for Wesley's career in the long run.  Wesley
could have been a great Pitino player and point guard.
And successful point guards are the name of the game in
the NBA right now - following an older trend in college.))

<p>
((O'Brien is being successful being more of a standard
NBA ``let the superstars - Pierce and Walker - run the
game" coach.
Walker's been pulling off triple doubles and in at least
some games the opposing shooting percentages have been
down and the Celtics' shooting percentages have been up.
O'Brien is even at 3-3, with most of those games on the
road.))

<p>
((Why couldn't Pitino see it and have the team play better, 
being such a great college coach, and with previous success
with the Knicks???
Pitino's book ``Success is a Choice'' proves that the team
couldn't make that choice - this is NOT especially shocking,
that rich basketball players might not be willing to make the
self sacrifices that lead to winning.  The concepts that make
any team successful - even a basketball team - are a choice, 
but not a choice that even a Rick Pitino could make happen.
I've studied Rick for some time, since he was a coach at Boston
University way back in the early 1980's and especially since
he came to Providence College in the mid-1980's, watching his
manic transformations.
I basically like him, I like him a lot.
But he is a Diplomacy player - in all the senses of the word.
He is always playing the game at a higher level than those around him.
While the Celtics might be able to play .500 and barely make
the playoffs under the new loose style under O'Brien, they
won't go farther.
Pitino was looking to challenge the Knicks, Heat, and the Western
Conference powers for the NBA Championship - which generally 
requires more defense, more discipline, and more attention
to the big picture than he was going to get from the team.
Walker and Pierce are not good defensive players and they
saw that they could do what they are doing now.
And why not do that, play .500, and be a star every other night?
Indeed, why not?
But Pitino wanted to challenge his former Graduate Assistant
at Providence College (Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks coach) and
teams like the Knicks to play .600 or .700 basketball.
Retread types like Billups and Mercer (who play even less
defense than Walker and Pierce) weren't going to accomplish
that either, though I agree with you that Fox and Wesley
could have helped.
With Fox taking Eric Williams' place, Wesley and Brown
sharing the point guard position, and the rest of the team
as it is now, that could have been a decent playoff team.
But ultimately, with the team he actually had,
that was too far out of the sphere his players
were in and it was better that he get out now,
much as I like watching him.)) 

<p>
((Still, Pitino undoubtedly has made some bigger mistakes,
that made it impossible for him to be more successful.
His impatience hurt him in just the same way that impatience while
playing Diplomacy has hurt every single one of us at one time or another.
And the nonsense about guaranteeing the playoffs and promising to leave
if the team didn't play great defense just became a self-fulfilling 
prophesy.
Yet Rick did turn away from nearly 25 million dollars in resigning his position
with the Celtics.  
He is to be commended for this financial sacrifice (though he really
doesn't need the money), but he is to be condemned for HOW he led himself
into failure.
He did many good things (putting the public blame for losing on himself
and thus protecting his players), but many more bad things (like guaranteeing
playoff appearances and promising to leave the team if they didn't make
the choice to improve - play team defense - that he knew was required).
Most people, when offered such a scapegoat, are only too quick to accept it.
Pitino, for the first time in his life perhaps, is a complete and total
failure, and because his players couldn't make the choice to want to win.
In his player personnel moves, he made a wholesale move to players with
so-called ``upside potential'' (what we used to call underachievers).
The problem was, upside potential too frequently was potential for
very good reasons.
It's sad, because he is a great personality, fun to listen to, and a great
basketball coach in his more humble moments.
I watch with great interest to see what will happen next - will he learn 
from these mistakes that we all make or not??
On the more prescient side, note that I mentioned John Linehan of the 
current local Providence College team last issue and he went out and led a defeat
of UConn and was named Big East Player of the Week!
We will have a fun team to root for as the season plays on.
Put a bag on the selfish Celtics.
Jim O'Brien has made the smart choice to just let Pierce and Walker shoot
selfishly and see how many shootouts he can win.
But the PC Friars play brilliant team basketball that is infinitely more fun to
watch!!!
That's what I will be doing for the rest of the basketball season.))</i>

Jim,

The stunningly-talented and sadly-overlooked Neil Innes wrote The
Rutles songs, *in the style of* the Beatles. Listen carefully now! Then
seek out The Innes Book Of Records.

<p>
<i>((I am a HUGE Neil Innes, Bonzo Dog Band, etc., etc. etc. fan.
I did know this, sorry if I wasn't clear enough about that!!))</i>

<p>
I trust you will have researched Kirsty MacColl as I suggested. I'll
leave it to you to comment.

<p>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Salut!  Rip, ripgch of yahoo.com</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<i>((I didn't really have to research Kirsty MacColl because I was
a huge fan of her ex-husband Steve Lillywhite's production work and
so although she made almost no US splash I was aware of her singing
talents on weird songs like ``There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop
Swears He's Elvis'' (from the early 80's album <b>Desperate Characters</b>)
and her duet with my favorite singer with the worst teeth known to man -
Shane MacGowan - ``Fairytale of New York''.  Her other albums have made
fair to middlin' impacts, but I have been listening a lot to 2000's 
<b>Tropical Brainstorm</b> which is going to hit my top music list of
this past year somewhere.
This stunning Latin-flavored pop album probably was going to launch her
into some degree of stardom (if for nothing else than that she was
prettier than Ricky Martin), but tragically, she died on December 18th,
2000 while swimming off the coast of Mexico.
I've seen and heard a variety of conflicting stories about the accident,
including some hints that some kind of ``excess partying'' played a 
factor.
I make no judgment except on the quality of Kirsty's singing and wish 
condolences and the best to her two sons 
(who now presumably will be raised by their father Steve Lillywhite).
Feel free to add anything I've missed, Rip!))</i>

<i>((I'm sorry to keep up something of a theme, but
this last letter of this issue is very special to me, and led to the
dedication at the top.
I've known Gary Coughlan in the hobby for 20 years now and Gary was the
publisher of one of the szines that influenced me the most.
I don't live up to Gary's standards in handwriting notes at the
end of the szine anywhere near as much as I would like, but the
space is there and I try.
I know many of you (like Mike Mills and Bruce Linsey) already saw this
message, but I asked Gary if he would let me publish it in the szine
where more of you could see it and he generously agreed.
As I have large proportions of friends outside the hobby who 
are gay (since my wife works in the theatre),
I know many hobby members are gay, and many of the rest of you
I know have been involved with PFLAG there are many similar stories 
I have heard that are not quite so uplifting.
And this is true on so many levels of family, politics, and life and death.
So, I wanted this one to be heard in a wider forum.
Thanks, Gary, and best wishes!))</i>

Parental Reconciliation and My Father's Passing On December 31, 2000</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Hello everyone,
         
<p>
I hope you don't mind being part of a group mailing because I 
don't want to write the same painful things several times.  The fact 
that you are getting this means that you are someone that I would like 
to know what has happened in my life during the past few weeks.  The 
whole story is summed up in this email's subject heading if you don't 
care to read the entire email.  All of you know parts of this story but 
only a very few know it all and I wanted to share this part of my life 
with you.  This is also the reason that I haven't had time to email 
answers to some of your letters.
       
<p>
Not sure if all of you know but 8 years ago, I told my parents I 
was gay.  This led to a rift between us and we had no contact for 8 
years.  For the last 6 years I have shared my life with my partner, 
Tony.
        
<p>
In November 2000, 2 first cousins who are like sisters to me, 
Donna and Pat, contacted me to let me know that my father was in very 
poor health.  Then my mother's best friend, who I call Mrs. Doris and 
who has known me since I was 7 years old, called me confirming what Pat 
and Donna had said.  To each I had said I wondered why my mother wasn't 
calling me about something so serious. The situation was that my father 
had gone in for a simple test which is usually out patient but the 
doctors considered him so frail that he was kept in the hospital to do 
it.  While there a random test discovered that he had spots on the lung 
and liver and it was thought to be cancer.
         
<p>
Then my mother called me on Wednesday, November 29 and we had a 
long talk about our differences.  She said that Tony and I were welcome 
in their home anytime and she wanted to reestablish our relationship. 
I let Tony and my mother talk to each other and we decided to go that 
same afternoon to see them.
      
<p>
We stayed about 2 hours and had a wonderful time.  I am excellent 
at picking up hidden hostility and my parents were very warm and 
honestly welcoming to us.  Tony took the picture of my parents and me 
that several of you have seen.  My father was frail but he was able to 
walk by himself without a walker or a cane at this time.  We made plans 
to go with them on December 8 to hear the doctors' report on what to do 
next.  We were and are fully reconciled and are a family again and this 
definitely includes Tony.  My mother loves him!
      
<p>
On December 7, I went to the monthly meeting of PFLAG (Parents, 
Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), a wonderful support group (for 
those of you who don't know about it) for both gays and lesbians and 
their parents.  For several years I had shared my story with them which 
was mostly about the estrangement with my parents and I wanted to share 
the good news of our reconciliation with them.  (I LOVE PFLAG!!!!!)
        
<p>
On December 8, Tony and I helped Mother take Daddy to the 
doctors.  Unlike Nov. 29, this time he had to use a walker with us 
helping him get into the car and up to the doctors' office.  The news 
was not optimistic.  The cancer was malignant and in the lungs and 
liver(and Mother said the chart also said in the brain).  The doctors' 
consensus was that no radiation or chemotherapy would be helpful and 
that the cancer was terminal.  What was best was to make Daddy as 
comfortable as possible and let him stay at home.  We would have the 
help of the Trinity Hospice to help with Daddy 3 times a week and a 
Trinity nurse who would check in on him twice a week.
       
<p>
I was also able to take advantage of the Family Medical Leave 
Act (which Bill Clinton and the Democrats finally passed in 1993 after 
years of obstruction by President Bush and the Republicans) and take 
leave from work to help my parents.  This also deepened the newly 
reestablished bonds between us.  And Tony was the biggest help of all.  
He showed us how to change my father's bed linens with the least amount 
of discomfort for Daddy, how to change his bed clothes, took vital 
signs.  We would have been lost without Tony and Mrs. Doris.
      
<p>
As the time went on, it became harder and harder to get Daddy to 
swallow his daily dose of pills or to eat very much and this was very 
frustrating to all of us. Tony was the first one to get him to take 
Ensure and he would also get him to talk more than anyone else.
     
<p>
On Wednesday, December 27, we got an oxygen machine to help with 
Daddy's breathing and to enable him to be able to cough up the 
congestion in his chest.  It seemed to help at first but he still seemed 
to be steadily weakening. 
       
<p>
I spent the nights of Friday and Saturday(Dec 29-30) and Tony 
came over and stayed all day Sunday, December 31.  Around noon he was 
still able to tell us his name but by the afternoon Daddy really seemed 
to be suffering and we felt so helpless.  We were able to get a suction 
machine late that afternoon and Tony and Mother used it to help with 
Daddy's chest congestion.  At one point Tony took his vital signs and 
his pulse was 64 and his blood pressure was 140 over 60.  This was 
better than we thought but it was very clear that Daddy couldn't go 
through much more much longer.
      
<p>
We all said our goodbyes and Mother, Tony and I were all in the 
room when Daddy passed about 9:30PM and Mother hugged Tony and told him 
how much it meant to have had him with us.  I was so grateful to have 
these last precious weeks with my father and to have my whole family 
together and I'm very happy he is at peace now and no longer in pain. 
Tony took charge of preparing my father before the funeral home people 
arrived.  At his direction, we cleaned him up, put new clothes on him 
and put lotion on his face  Then we ate a late supper that Tony had 
prepared for us.
       
<p>
Those of you who are in Memphis know how awful the weather was on 
that Sunday, December 31....heavy snow, icy roads, bitter cold.  When 
the funeral home people took Daddy out on the trolley exactly at 
midnight, the door was open with the cold wind chilling us and fireworks 
were sounding off everywhere.  It is a New Year's Eve I won't soon 
forget.
        
<p>
My father's name was Leonard T. Coughlan and he was 78 years 
old.  The funeral will be Thursday, January 4, at Forest Hill East 
Funeral Home on Whitten Road. Traditionally the flowers that go on the 
casket are from the family and have the family members' names on it and 
my mother has told me that Tony's name was going to be on it with hers 
and mine.  This sweet gesture has touched me so much and it means so 
much.  I know this has been a long email but I did want to let you know 
what has been going on. Thanks for letting me share what has happened 
with my family with you.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
REGULAR DIPLOMACY GAME OPENING: Why not? I find them cake to run,
let's open another regular game too..... I especially encourage
foreigners to join and others with E-Mail.
Matt Sundstrom, James Alan Tretick and Don Williams are signed up.
The other Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings'' rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Jack McHugh claims the Federation,
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
The other races in the game are the Klingons, Cardassians, Species 8472,
and the Vulcans.
We ONLY need two more, let's get this one going.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED and Breaking Away games.
I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.
Breaking Away has Jim Tretick signed up thus far.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of meurglys.com
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p>
(RUSSIA): Happy New Year to you and your'n, Jim Bob Boy!

<p>
'Twas the night before Christmas, and everyone was making Merry!  So, 
Mary got up and left.

<p>
My older sister was named Mary.  If that was her, she would have stayed.

<p>
(GERMANY): Happy New Year, Jim! We had our New Year celebration
here in Maryland, but we used Rio de Janeiro time so
as not to have to stay up so late. 

<p>
(ANKARA to BERLIN): Have mucho cervazas for me Senor. You live a most 
interesting life it would seem...

<p>
(POPE to THE WORLD): Deny me Rome and you shall all burn in gravy you hell
sucking pigs or something like that.

<p>
(MAR(relocated French Capitol) - WORLD): This will be interesting.
    
<p>
(MAR - LON): Hope this doesn't disappoint you to much. 

<p>
(TUR to RUS): You DO have an interesting style of play, I'll say that for 
you... 

<p>
(LONDON (OCT 1, 1904)): Prime Minister John Beale condemned, in Parliament,  
the unholy alliance between the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman Empires. 
``With the ascension of the Emperor Paul, the Christian Powers in Europe hoped for, 
in fact, encouraged a change in the foreign policy of the Emperor's government. 
Alas, the Austro-hungarian government appears determined to subject Europe 
to a reckless and adventurist war. The Emperor is blind to the growing might 
of Sultan behind him. This preposterous policy does nothing for Austria-Hungary 
and everthing for the heathen Ottoman Empire. It is not the Sultan who is the 
`sickman' of Europe. The sickman is the Hapsburg Emperor. He must surely be insane!" 
His majesty's leader of the opposition replied, ``I do not believe
the head of his majesty's government, the Prime Minister, should be declaring 
anyone sick or insane. Is he now a psychiatrist? 
He, himself, is insane for insulting a foreign head of state."

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Unless superceded below, all rules are as in regular Diplomacy.

<p>
2) The game lasts seven game years (measured Winter to Winter, 1901 to 1907), 
with each player rotating through the powers in alphabetical order (AEFGIRT),
playing each power for one game year.  At the end of each game
year, the game board and positions are fully reset to the initial
positions.

<p>
3) Initial Positions: All units and supply center ownership are as in
regular Diplomacy, except that each player has five nuclear weapons
(except for Russia which has only four nuclear weapons).

<p>
4) Firing Nuclear Weapons: Each nuclear weapon (nuke) is fired 
at a specific province (land or sea) according to 
orders submitted by their owners immediately FOLLOWING the Spring
moves (nuke orders are submitted with those moves and cannot be made
conditional on any outcomes or moves in the Spring turn).
Nuclear weapon strikes destroy the supply center in the targeted
province, if any, as well as any units in that province following
the Spring turn.

<p>
5) Effects of Nuclear Weapons (Black Hole Variant): The effects of
the nuclear weapon strike are equivalent to those in the Black
Hole variant designed by Conrad von Metzke (Conrad is the unofficial
ombudsman for adjudication of paradoxes caused by this rule).
Any provinces adjacent to a nuke strike province are now themselves
adjacent.
The effect of nuke strikes on adjacent provinces creates a cumulative
effect such that all provinces adjacent to an a contiguous string of
nuke strike provinces are all simultaneously adjacent.
This effect applies to moves, supports, retreats, and convoys.
Coastal provinces that are nuked transmit their coastal status to
all adjacent provinces, which also is cumulative in effect.
These coastal status changes do not interfere with any army supports,
retreats, or moves between two land provinces separated by
a contiguous string of nuke strike provinces.

<p>
6) Victory Conditions: The game ends at the end of the seventh winter
adjustment season.
Victory points are garnered by cumulatively adding supply centers owned
at the end of each of the seven game years.
The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.
Ties are broken by sequentially comparing victory points owned in
1907 followed by each preceding year.
Players earning precisely the same number of victory points in each
of the seven game years remain tied.

<p>
7) Note that Jody wins the game by the victory criterion since he 
had more centers in 1907 (coming from behind counts for more).
Everyone else lined up very nicely (perhaps with a bit of plotting??)
with no tie breaks needed.

<p>
8) I am taking reservations for the Edward Teller game, which will
be the next NYEED 7x7 game in this series.
Since it was asked, I'll remind everyone that we will again be
playing the Black Hole Variant.
Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.
Karl Muller, Harry Andruschak, and Sandy Kenny are on board.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Apologies for not responding sooner.  I have had a hectic time
since returning from my European vacation on 12 November.  I had three weeks
worth of mail to catch up on that included quite a few Dip zines - er - szines.
Before I could do much about it, I was hit with the flu and out of things for
three weeks during which I NMRed way too many zines.

<p>
Now, normally I would have had a flu shot before going on vacation, but this
year the vaccine was in short supply, and at my age and with all my health
problems it was serious indeed. By the time it was all over, my physician
diagnosed me with the onset of gynecomastia. I'll let our resident quack, Dr.
Weiss, explain what that is.  Perhaps gynecomastia is God's way of punishing
me for the Sara Reichert hoax. And on top of all that we have had the usual
Christmas crunch at the Post Office and the annual effort to help newcomers
to AA through their first Christmas holiday sober.  I really could have done
without the last two months.
          
<p>
(GM-ANDY): You have to admit the gynecomastia is at least a little
amusing!!

<p>
(ANDY-GM): For an older adult, it can have its moments.  For a teenager, it can
be a living hell.  Kids can be cruel, teenagers even crueler.  You know the
statistics of teenagers committing suicide, and some of those are sufferers
of gynecomastia who couldn't take it any more.  The social problems of trying
to hide the breasts, or wearing a bra, can cause a crippled life to those in
their 20s and 30s.  Many opt for surgery, but the results can range from OK
to hideous, and few medical insurance programs will pay for it. Even for
older adults, being caught wearing a bra opens you to being attacked by
queer-bashers. Not to mention the social problems. Having said all that, I
suppose a 56 year old curmudgeon like me who does not suffer fools gladly
may have an easier time of it.  In any case, I have only grown from size AAA
to AA, and we may be able to find the cause before things get too bad.  At
the moment, my main problem is the tenderness and pain.    
                               
<p>
(RUSSIA):  Arf!

<p>
(ENGLAND-TIES ARE LIKE KISSING YOUR SISTERS): Cackle, cackle, 
heh-heh.  If I can't win, I can keep others from winning.  Scheming is 
so much fun.  Thanks all for the great fun.  Congrats to those kissing 
their sisters.  Thank you Jim-Bob for the fun time.  And my last Dip 
Variant ends.  Ciao to the ``Hobby" for now.

<p>
(SANDY to GM): Thanks for giving me the opportunity to play in this game.  It
was a lot of fun despite not winning.  Even though I'll be busy with the new
baby in May (our third!!), I would still like to get involved in another
Nuclear Yuppie game.  Let me know if there are any openings!!

<p>
(BOOB to MOM WITH THE REAL THINGS): Way to go!
Congratulations on approaching number three!!
Good to speak with you briefly too.
You're in on the new game.

<p>

the Austro-Hungarian leadership will fill this gap.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note Paul Rauterberg's new E-Mail address.

<p>
2) Does this game wanna go on the RAG?  
If so, then vote for that three way draw.
If no one votes for it then someone's gonna RAG on you!!!

<p>
3) I think it's kind of amazing that all seven powers are still on the board.
Admittedly THREE of you only have a single solitary unit, but you're there,
and who knows what can happen then?

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOZ to JIM-BOB): As I understand it, the premise was to get a game of
Professional Liars going.  Why are you excluding Marketeers and Used Car
Dealers?

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): That's a damned good idea!
Especially since we can't seem to find any damned lawyers who want to play!!
Any thoughts from the organizer???

<p>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND): What is a man who has conquered the world but lost his
home?  Or something like that...

<p>
(RUSSIA - TURKEY): I sense some bitterness here. I don't understand, all I did
was make a last minute change, you're the one that taught me how to do that
(twice in this game alone).   
  
<p>
(GOZ to STEVE): Hey, my Blackhawks are actually making a run!  Look for them
to get the 8th seed in the West and then get swept!

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ITALY): Sorry again, but I could not resist.
I assure you that I will take good care of your wine
stocks when in Rome (hic!).

<p>
(AUSTRIA - TURK-IN-EXILE): No reason. I'm just being a dork.     

<p>
(GOZ to JIM-BOB II): I missed a couple of days' worth of news...did Bud
``Puppet" Selig actually make the suggestion that I thought I heard?  The
bottom 8 teams get to draft a player off the roster of the top 8?  But the
top 8 get to protect 25 of their top 40?  So the bottom 8 don't really get
much, and if they do they can't pay them anyway, so have to trade them for a
prospect that will go elsewhere in 3 years if he's good.  Is that about right?

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): You got it about right, and I think it will be totally cosmetic.
Crap!

the triplets a distant fourth.  The four horsemen just ain't what they

Where's the beer?
<i>((Damned if I know, you must really be out of it, you can't 
even spell your own name right!))</i>

<p>
(BRIT PACK): Happy new  year to you.  I presume it is still 
politically correct to say that 
without offending the people who worry about offending the Chinese and others 
who work to a different calendar to (most of) the western world?  Most of the 
Christmas greetings I received from Americans wished me ``Happy holidays" which 
was very kind of them, but I think of my holiday (vacation) as the long break 
I take in the summer so it took me a while to realise they were referring (in 
my case) to Christmas.
<i>((I find the ``happy holidays'' to be happy crap and avoid it whenever
possible.
This year I was a bit more wishy washy than I am some years though.))</i>

<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``It looks like an accident,
caused by the government.''
From ``Tina'' off one of the year 2000's very best recordings
by the greatest rock and roll band extant - The Mekons!
Said recording is <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>.

<p>
(JEFF to BOOB): This <b>IS</b> Palm Beach!

<p>
(SPAIN-WORLD): We marching ten by ten errah! Errah! We'll marching 9 by 9
errah! errah! we'll marching 8 by 8 errah! errah! we'll marching errah!
errah! We'll be marching 7 by 7 errah! errah! We'll be marching 6 by 6 errah!
errah! we'll be running 5 by 5 errah! errah! We'll be running 4 by 4 away
away far far away errah! Ahhhhh!
I know I have a weird sense of humor.

<p>
(EGYPT to WORLD): Send help!

<p>
(BRITAIN-GERMANY): Guess you didn't trust me either, huh?
Oh well, I'm sure Sean wouldn't have appreciated the fleets
off his shores.

<p>
(EGYPT to UKRAINE): And Germany, wouldn't it just be great if Ukraine
took Izm and Serbia and Germany took Croatia and Mil and Mar?

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): We'll have it thanks for the pepper jack sauce we stole from
the Pop though didn't he say it was sinful to eat.

<p>
(EGYPT to SPAIN): The ink wasn't even dry on the Spanish National News
rejoicing over Mar before Italy retook it.
No more rejoicing unless you can hold the center. 

<p>
(SPANISH TRIBUNE): The loss of Mar is said will not falter the Spanish
Egyptian lines drawn around Italy, though the Klingon Strike force was
destroyed in the attack on Mar, so the people of Spain says down with the
Star Trek press: Mister Few the Proud the Star Trek fanatics. Though I'm an
X-Men fan and they met Picard first in the ``Time's Arrow'' and again in 
``Planet X''. 

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG CONFUSED): The Romulans and Cardassians have been involved
in a few skirmishes and the Romulans have inexplicably left open their
flank for a Cardassian or a Bajoran invasion.
The Cardassians have also destroyed the Federation starship ``Calamity'' 
while they were defending the Klingon front.
The Klingons lost a starbase and I may be tactical necessity be forced to
give the Klingons another one of our Federation bases.
The Cardassians with apparent Bajoran approval have sent a starship toward
the Klingons' rear frontier.
If the Cardassians continue, the Klingons may fall before we do (not that
it matters).
I have been able to maintain our front lines by cutting Romulan/Ferengi supply
liines.
This won't last long.
My ``spies'' behind Romulan lines have informed me that the Romulans have tortured
Spock and Chekov together by injecting Spock with a hormone to induce 
Pon Farr, the Vulcan mating ritual.
Then they locked them in the same room, hoping that Chekov would talk.
As it turns out, Chekov really didn't mind.... (who knew?!).
I've also heard that Captain Janeway and her crew escaped in escape pods and
are in hiding. 
I understand Commander Tuvok has been demoted.
As often as Voyager had been taken over by hostile aliens, Janeway decided to 
change his title from Security Officer to Hospitality Officer.
Kirk out.

<p>
(FEDERATION ``HIGH'' COMMAND to PAUL): Under the terms of the Organian ``Peace''
Treaty, the Romulans can cloak anything, the Klingons can only cloak Scout Class
vessels, and the Federation is basically screwed.
To make matters worse, the Klingons have broken the treaty more times than the
US government ever did to conquer the Indians.
Or, more to the point, as David Kirk (Kirk's son) was quoted as saying right before
a Klingon cut his yuppie throat, ``there's never an Organian around when you 
need one!''

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG #2 KIRK to STARFLEET): Please send us a trained counselor.
I believe the Cardassian Commander may be suffering from multiple personality
disorder.
We need to find out if any of these personalities could be turned pro-Federation.
