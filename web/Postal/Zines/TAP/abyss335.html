<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.  
Join the tidal wave of Dippers going to 
World DipCon in Chicago in August, we still can overwhelm Shark Chum with 330 warm bodies!

<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug will keep us on schedule so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

Turns out getting Allan B. Calhamer, the creator of Diplomacy, to attend the World Diplomacy Championship at Weasel Moot VI was as easy as:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Dropping by his home in LaGrange Park on official business for Edi Birsan and another hobby luminary who wishes to remain anonymous for now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Leaving a letter in his mailbox when no one answered the doorbell.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) And exchanging emails with his youngest daughter, Selenne.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mr. Calhamer, his wife and perhaps Selenne will be joining us for a few hours during the third round on Saturday, Aug. 11. Don't miss the opportunity to meet the man who started it all!

It's an interesting question as to who is a better manager, Little or Valentine.
Little just seems like a bit of a dummy, while Valentine is a jerk.
For all his faults, Francona is far and away the best manager I've seen in 
Boston.  But they've really had a lot of stinkers.  Don't get me started on Zimmer.
I'm with Bill Lee: he's a giant gerbil.
