<div class="p"><!----></div>
One could say I'm late because I'm sick, but that really would be wrong, I feel
incredibly much better than I did last month, so let me say that first.
You also may be coming here to read this knowing what I've already announced in 
<i>Diplomacy World</i> and that is that after a lot of angst on my part not 
knowing what was wrong with me, I finally was diagnosed with Cancer of the Small
Intestine (Just below the stomach) at the end of February.
I'm getting chemotherapy treatment every other week, completing the third treatment
this week, with three more to go before reassessment.
But my oncologist tells me (and my body is telling me) that the chemotherapy is working
really well.  
I was down to barely being able to consume a pure liquid diet.
My stomach processing capacity on "real food" is back to about 50% of normal, 
so that just means eating six meals a day instead of three, but I'm actually hungry
again.
And after losing 25 pounds originally, I've gained five pounds back.
Nothing ever is guaranteed with the course of cancer and treatment, and of course
I'm VIVIDLY aware of the journey I just went on with my best friend in the Diplomacy
hobby, Don Williams, that ended so poorly last year, he had a much more global type
of intestinal cancer.  Mine is more localized, though there are some worrisome "spots" 
elsewhere that we're going to have to watch as we assess how the chemotherapy progresses.
As Steve Cooley says, "We Hate Cancer", and we do.
But I'm doing pretty darned well and planning to get through this and move on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My other good friend Mark Fassio (and the three of us, Don, Mark and me last were
together at the Baltimore World DipCon a little over a decade ago) also is an
abdominal cancer patient, currently in some optimistic but still dangerous level of recovery.
He's been through what I'm doing now, plus other things that may be in my future,
like surgery.
I certainly welcome prayers and good wishes from you all, and I partly delayed telling 
you all about this (given what happened to Don) so that I can tell you and also be so
much more positive about how everything is going than I was a month ago.
For those of you who were with me at TempleCon, where I ran a very encouraging 
(in the sense of GRABBING lots more people into the FTF hobby) Diplomacy
tournament (reported on last issue), I felt REALLY horrible there, about five
times worse than I feel right now.
The tumor has to be smaller, unless it is just hiding and not bothering me very much,
either way, that's fine and it is how I feel that matters.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It took a long time for me (plus various physicians) to figure out what was going on,
at least partly because a tumor in this place is relatively rare.  You hear a lot
about colon cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, all FAR
more common, and some of you may not have even thought duodenal cancer (the technical
name was even possible).  Well, of course it is, and bad luck for me that I have it.
But I'm feeling really positive, I had only ONE really bad day so far a few weeks ago
since the diagnosis, and mostly feel FAR better knowing what I'm battling.  
That's much better than NOT knowing.
If you send me notes about this, let me know if you'd rather they not be published here,
otherwise I will likely publish an array of them next issue as a way of stimulating 
comments from me.
My intention, rather than use Facebook or other platforms to update people on this,
is to do the "old fashioned" thing of using my Diplomacy szine to convey monthly
information.  I may respond to notes as desired/needed, but mostly I will give monthly
updates here.
Someone way older in both age and hobby experience, Larry Peery, was surprised that was
what I plan to do... really, Larry?  ;-)
What is this thing the Internet?  Facebook?
Szines are THE thing...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, I plan to keep doing everything I like doing, which includes all of the hobby
things I'm doing.  But don't hold me to deadlines.  I'm in about five Diplomacy games
on various platforms (well, I guess I have to stick to deadlines there, but Michael
Cuffaro in particular has found I can be challenged with that, so far) 
and I will keep playing in all of them (not calling attention to this
so if you're in games with me, realize you can talk about it, but some fellow players
may not read <i>TAP</i>).
I plan on being around for a long time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Doug may or may not be winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.
My intent right now is to do that.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to do that, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
If you looked before, I was having some problems with updating, but I've corrected
them, so you should be able to see everything there.  The address is still:
/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped, including my brother
and Paul Rauterberg.  I'm not sure why.  They need to resubscribe.

(2 Final 4, including my overall champ, out in the first weekend), it's at least a sport I know something about...

NL East:  What the heck happened in Philadelphia and Atlanta?  Nats, Mets (WC), Marlins, Braves, Phillies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Hey!  The Cubs are back to the point where they can break my heart in September instead of May!!!  Still a year away though.  Cards, Cubs (85-77), Pirates, Brewers, Reds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Sooner or later I'll get this one right:  Dodgers, Giants (WC), Padres, Diamondbacks, Rockies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 AL East:  What if they gave a division and no one won?  I think everyone except the Rays could be a Wild Card, but I don't think any of them are world beaters.  Blue Jays, Yankees, Red Sox, Orioles, Rays.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  Sooner or later my Cleveland friends won't be influencing me.  Indians, Tigers (WC), White Sox (also 85-77), Royals, Twinkies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  One of these years this division will make sense.  This won't be it.  Mariners, Angels (WC), A's, Rangers, Astros.

  Seattle over Washington in the WS.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For some reason the Red Sox purged their locker room of all their best starters last summer.  I didn't understand why they did that.  
They could use Jon Lester right about now.  Or John Lackey or even Felix Doubront.  (I won't go as far as to say Jake Peavy.)  
But hey, they've got a lot of hitting now!  Every week they seem to find a new Cuban to join the team.  
But apparently Rusney Castillo isn't going to start because Farrell is old school and going to keep starting Victorino, 
who's had a dreadful spring.  Well, he'll be injured soon enough.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have no idea what's happening in baseball these days - apparently the Nats added Bond villain Max Scherzer to 
their already-great rotation.  (You can tell he's a Bond villain because his eyes are different colors.)  
If the Sox had the Nats' pitching or the Nats had the Sox' hitters, that would be an awesome team.  
Also, if I had wings and webbed feet, I would be a duck. 
<i>((Quack, quack, always makes me think of Don....))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I predict large market teams will dominate, small market teams will be plucky, and 10,000 trolls will continue to 
insist that David Ortiz must have done PEDs in 2003 because some anonymous phone caller told them so.

<i>((OK, well, THAT'S encouraging.
I am quite torn about the Red Sox, but I'm NOT going to take Dave's position.
With my other favorite team, the SF Giants, it's an odd year for them, which
always means THEY fail miserably.
So, I'm going to go with the model that pushes the Red Sox forward and restrains myself
on the Giants.
We'll see how that works out for me.
Now to MY useless predictions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: Red Sox (yeah, really!  I honestly don't understand why anyone's that worried about the rotation,
the Red Sox WILL make a deadline trade, and everyone thinks [with lots of reason] that this will be a really
active midseason deadline trade market, plus they have this secret weapon knuckleballer that we've been 
watching in Pawtucket for some time [Steven Wright] who could turn out as good or better than Tim Wakefield
and Matt Barnes also has looked great.  And the hitting is going to be incredible, it will be fun to watch), 
Orioles (WC, the Orioles showed the way to how to win without an "Ace" which seems to be the biggest knock
on the Red Sox this spring, they will be real good this year too, but not as good as the Sox. Matt Wieters
has to come back and show Christian Vasquez how catcher Tommy John surgery can work, and same with Machado
and Davis.), 
Blue Jays (Great young new pitchers on the Blue Jays, they could upset the apple cart ahead of them, if
they can support the strong hitting.), 
Rays (Unfortunately, a shadow of the Rays teams of the past, the loss of one of the top 5 managers in baseball
most definitely doesn't help), Yankees (Can we all root against Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira?  Won't have
to, they'll break down on their own, ditto with Tanaka and Sabathia.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: Indians (I'm going with Goz's friends on this one! Plus, I still love Terry Francona. Watch Corey Kluber
and the rest of that rotation, especially Trevor Bauer and TJ House - like the Red Sox, there are questions,
but I think they will be resolved.),
Tigers (Aging, yes, but I think they squeak into second, but not enough for a WC.  We had to trade them Yoenis Cespedes, and he will be 
pretty good, but NOT as good as "our" Cubans...), Royals (Too many losses, small market teams make their
run and then come back to earth), White Sox (I'm probably underrating them, they added a lot of people.), Twins
(Watch their young hitters, but still last, Ervin Santana's penalty won't help.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: Mariners (Taijuan Walker got a huge amount of buzz out there in the Cactus League this spring, we
haven't really seen him in action, but if he is the real deal to add to a much better lineup and King Felix
plus Hisashi Iwakuma this could be a World Series team, I'm not quite picking them to go there, but 
they're on the edge), A's (WC, I always like the A's to find a way, and I think they will again given all
the other weakness and uncertainty around the AL.  The whole team seems different again, and some young
guys like Mark Canha and Billy Burns had great springs, Coco Crisp's injury should only keep him out the
first month or so.), Angels (expect MORE upheaval like they've had this week with Hamilton, this will
be the soap opera team of the West), Astros (yes, Houston is finally accumulating enough young talent to make
some noise - could be a surprise challenger for a while and beat out a wiped out Angels team), Rangers (sorry,
Doug, but this team is a mess, not sure what they're doing or why).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: Nationals (Gotta be the WS odds on favorite... best rotation in baseball, really good lineup, nuff said), 
Mets (Matt Harvey looks good and a great mix of experience and some great young players, could be a WC), 
Marlins (drifiting down, not exciting, classic team of thinking they're better than they are, though Giancarlo 
Stanton should have another great year), Braves (WOW, in rebuild mode for the first time in 25 years!  Not 
much here, but anything will beat the Phillies... they need to keep Craig Kimbrel until they get good
again and have great young pitchers - keep the eye on Alex Wood!  They are all young, then they just need
to find a lineup, but not this year), Phillies (when or when and who or who will get Cole Hamels, the smart
money always is on the Yankees, unfortunately, which could upset the applecart where I hae them finishing last in
the other East.  But the Yankees will get off to a poor enough start to dampen their interest in Hamels, and the
Red Sox still might get him - or the Phillies may blow it and not ever get the deal they want, in other interest,
who will they trade Papelbon to?  The Red Sox apparently have a small amount of interest in getting him back too.
What actually happens on the field, who cares?).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: Cardinals (the best team in Baseball's best division, they will beat each other up, and a Wild Card will 
go to the West, but the three of the NL's five best teams clearly come from here.  The Cardinals still look like the
clear favorite though. Adam Wainwright needs to stay healthy though.), Pirates (WC, this team has a lot of good
feelings about itself, and they could make another leap this year; A.J. Burnett and Francisco Liriano are the
keys to anchoring the rotation, but I think they again to WC and the one game risk), Cubs (as Goz says, the 
Cubbies will battle for a WC this year, perhaps, but fall short.  The tough teams in this division will beat each other up a bit.
The big news at the end of training camp was a bit of roster manipulation, just what Theo likes to do to
Scott Boras, but that won't matter much.  The real issues are that they still have some rotation and lineup
holes and not enough experience, but they'll get it this year), Brewers (solid fourth place team, if Ryan Braun stays
on the field, he'll have another monster year, possibly MVP level, and I like Wily Peralta's chances at a great
year in the rotation.  But they won't challenge enough to move up, I don't think.), Reds (This is NOT a last place team,
but is by default in Baseball's best division. They didn't make a lot of changes, but already had a good team
that had 2014 injury problems, if they don't trade away Cueto and have some good injury luck, they can finish
second easily, so watch out!!!).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: Dodgers (let's get it straight, I hate everything about the Dodgers, but there they are), 
Padres (WC, Along with some others around here, we are the charter members of the Will Middlebrooks fan cl
Of course Will won the starting third base job, relegating Yangervis Solarte to the super-sub role he is best
suited to, other things are coming together for the Padres, and as long as their three injury prone pitchers:
Andrew Cashner, Brandon Morrow, and Josh Johnson mostly stay on the field, they will be a WC shoo-in and beat
the bad luck Pirates in the WC game.), Giants (my real favorite team for forever and forever, I'll be rooting,
but let's be honest, this is an ODD year and the Giants don't succeed in ODD years.  Beyond that, there is some
rebuilding to be done and I think they really will end up in third, even as I root all season for the Padres and
Giants to bounce the Dodgers out of the playoffs on their butts.  Is Casey McGehee a surprise solution?  Probably
not.), Diamondbacks (Wow, look at all the Tommy John comebacks!!!  Nuff said.), Rockies (Some really big offense 
out of Coors Field, Corey Dickerson in particular!!!  Can Carlos Gonzalez make a full comeback?  Still, the obvious
last place team here.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WC: Padres beat Pirates; A's beat Orioles

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS: Boston Red Sox come out on top, not guessing how, but Mariners likely ALCS opponent if they don't have to
beat them in the first round.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS: This is the Nationals year, although I have the Dodgers on top they aren't going anywhere and I don't think
the Cardinals have enough.  Padres could make it to NLCS to face the Nationals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series: I think the Nationals win, probably NOT against the Red Sox though that's my pick to get there, more
likely against the Mariners.... see how I cheated there?  Tough, them's my predictions.
We now have some more back and forth from our commentators to finish us out.))</i>

Baseball started testing for PEDs in 2004 and Ortiz has passed countless tests, including from the years 2004-2007.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The only reason to think that Ortiz used PEDs is if you look at variation in his stats and think that PEDs 
are the only possible explanation.  But there were injuries along the way, esp. a serious wrist injury that held him back for over a year.

I would point out that Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte did not fail drug tests.  
So it seems more than likely that masking agents are 10 years ahead of drug tests.  
Heck, the masking agents could probably keep MLB from detecting Red Kool-Aid in Jim-Bob's system.

"So it seems more than likely that masking agents are 10 years ahead of drug tests."
Well, there <b>weren't</b> any drug tests before 2004.  2004 was also Bonds's last MVP season.  
In 2005 his OPS plummeted to 1.071, which is admittedly great but is also <b>.350</b> below his previous season's number.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2004 was also Clemens's last Cy Young season.  He managed to also pitch at a high level in 2005 before 
essentially becoming a part-time pitcher.  Were they still on the juice?  They didn't have to be.  
Steroids are for <b>building</b> muscle mass.  It's not clear to me how much they are needed to <b>preserve</b> muscle mass, 
esp. if a person keeps a serious workout regiment.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That brings us to Manny Ramirez, who had his first positive drug test in 2009, for a masking agent.  
He also had two positive tests in 2011, at which point he retired.  
My theory about Manny is that he started using when his skills started to decline.  
After all, he tested negative for five years or more.  And as we saw later, he wasn't 
the most skilled at using masking agents to avoid positive results.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Best example ever of "Manny being Manny".))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My basic gripe about the 2003 list is that it was based on league-wide testing using a test 
with an unknown false positive rate.  The false positive rate could have been as low as 1% and there 
still would have been players listed as "positive" simply because of statistical noise. 
That's what happens when you test over 500 people at once!  And that's why that round of 
testing wasn't supposed to be used to isolate individuals.  
At one point I did a bit of research on steroid tests, and I think that a 1% false positive rate is 
likely a low estimate, certainly for what was being used in 2003.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The thing about the false positive rate is that, as long as you don't care about which individuals are 
testing positive, you can still use such a test to measure the league-wide proportion of players using PEDs.  
If your false positive rate is 1%, and you test 500 people, and you get, say, 100 positives, 
that's going to indicate widespread usage.  As long as the observed positive rate 
is much higher than the (known) false positive rate, that's strong evidence.

<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Fri, Apr 3, 2015 at 6:05 PM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For Bonds, Clemens, and Pettite, there is testimony linking them to steroid usage.  
For Clemens and Pettite, that testimony comes from Pettite himself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Barry Bonds' trainer at BALCO was a guy named Greg Andersen, who supplied him with "the cream" and "the clear".  
Bonds claims that Andersen lied to him about what was in these substances.  I think it's reasonable to be suspicious about that.  
Bonds was indicted for perjury for claiming that he hadn't used PEDs.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Brian McNamee was the personal trainer of Clemens and Pettite on the Yankees and has claimed that he provided both of them with steroids.  
Pettite even admitted this was true, and said that Clemens had also used them.  
Curiously, when called upon to testify under oath about Clemens, who was facing Contempt of Congress charges, Pettite's memory became faulty.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sammy Sosa was apparently on the same list as Ortiz, and there is no other evidence against him.  
However, he is known to have used a corked bat, and has not protested his innocence as vehemently as Ortiz.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I would say that the evidence against Clemens is pretty strong.  Pettite has admitted to steroid use.  
As for Bonds, it really requires a good deal of credulousness to think that he had a trainer who was giving other people 
steroids, but Bonds didn't know about the steroids in what he was himself getting.  Also, the Bonds power surge <b>at the age of 36</b> 
in 2001 is nothing like we've seen from any other player, ever.  From 2001 to 2004, Bonds was the best hitter in the history of baseball.  
Over the prior 9 years, he had been an elite slugger, with OPS above 1.00 and above 1.1 a couple times.  
His OPS starting in 2001: 1.379, 1.381, 1.278, 1.422.  What baseball player peaks <b>in his late 30s?</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In contrast, the statistical changes with Ortiz have non-suspicious explanations.  
His numbers for the Twins were lower because it was known he couldn't hit an inside curveball.  
When he got to Boston, he did the work to fix that weakness, and became a much better hitter.  
He had a dip later in 2008 and 2009 relating to a serious wrist injury.  
As the wrist healed, he got his power and bat speed back.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If anybody wants to take the same attitude with Sosa that I take with Ortiz, that's fine with me.  
There's not a lot of evidence there.  But there's plenty of evidence against Bonds and Clemens.

<i>((Yeah, my feelings about Bonds are complex, and go way back to my history as a Giants fan and a
Bobby Bonds fan in the 1970's.  
I think in the end my feelings are best placed in what I always thought was Goz's feelings as well,
that the big cohoonie of the Steroids Era was Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig.
I am strongly in favor of the idea that "reality is never known, all we have are the rules and the
enforcement of the rules" and that's what we should rely on, bastardized and incomplete as they are.
Records set under the rules are the records that were set and should be relied on.  
You can't reinvent history, people made decisions based on the incentives present at the time,
one should not reinvent that past based on present incentives.
All is different only by degree today.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick, you can pull out any studies or reports that you want, but the basic issue is that MLB has really not had any incentive 
to have any drug testing that does anything beyond catch an occasional superstar and the more occasional utility infielder.  
Has that cleaned things up?  Yeah, some.  Did it catch 100% of the cheaters since 2004?  No one believes that.  
What percentage *does* it catch?  No one knows, and MLB isn't interested in knowing.  They want drugs to go away, 
but they still know that if too many superstars get A-Rod'ed the profit goes down.
To this point you cannot convince me that the game is clean, only "cleaner".  Are Ortiz' numbers from 10 years ago tainted?  
Can't prove one way or the other, and never will unless he writes a "tell-all".

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DISTRICT 12): Looks like Team Froggy should be dominating the final sprint.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BICYCLING MASTER): We have six more point scoring slots to go, and that should happen next turn.
Remember that you DO NOT want the lowest card default, so send me orders!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BICYCLING MASTER LOOKING BACKWARD): We now have SEVEN riders dropped from the pack, that might
be near a record!  No one else will be dropped before we're done, maybe even just one more turn,
if six more riders get across.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BICYCLING MASTER LOOKING FORWARD): Yes, well assuming we finish next time (and we should unless
you guys screw up royally), this will be the last calculation of total replenishments and then
I'll calculate the efficiency score next time.
In terms of total replenishments, we rank like this.
Rick, David, and Andy Bate are the top three, but I don't think the final order will be David, Andy Bate,
then Rick in third as you rank in total replenishments, but we will see.
Andy York and then Hank Alme come next in that order in total replenishments, but look like they'll
flip in points.
Brendan looks like he trails the field in both.
Again, final orders matter though, clearly.
Good luck, riders!!!

<b>So, another thing going on in my life lately has been the passing away of my father.  I've heard some of the rest of you
describing what that has meant to you, and for me of course that is still evolving.
I've accepted this was where we were going quickly with him for at least six months.
He had his own (as they all are) type of Lewy Body Dementia that took one of the most social and communicatively engaged people
I've ever known (though he was old school, never got into this cell phone internet age much) and put him in a silent world where
he understood fully who everyone was and what was going on, but couldn't really speak or communicate much.  
He fought hard and tried to stay positive (again, something I am experiencing and understanding really well right now),
but through December of 2014 realized he wasn't going to get better and then slowly came to accept what was happening.
Since among the many things I study as a Health Economist is palliative care, and I've gone through these issues a number 
of times in my wife's family, I then knew what the process was going to be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think it worked as well as such things can for my brothers (I have three, you mostly all just know David), my mother
and the rest of the family, but so many of us do not understand how "passing away" in our society works these days.
He ended up having only one real hospital stay in his life (at the early part of the very end over his fractured elbow from
a fall) and passed away quietly in the middle of the night with my mother at his side.
If you look at my Dad's obituary and of course that only partly describes his life, you will note how I (as best I could) tried
to sum up his life in my remarks at his funeral.  Buried in the long obituary is one of his achievements he was most proud of,
getting the Vigil Honor in the Order of the Arrow as an adult leader in the Boy Scouts of America.  As a scout, though I am
an Eagle Scout, I only got to the Brotherhood Honor in the Order of the Arrow (OA), but OA was very important to me as well.
In thinking about this in his life and my own, I realized how much the "Leadership in Service" challenge of the Vigil Honor
defines our approach to such a large amount of what he did and what I continue to do.
I'll miss my Dad incredibly and I thank so many of you who already have passed along condolences.</b>
