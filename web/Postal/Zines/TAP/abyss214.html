<p><br><p><br>``So I called up George and he called up Jim, I said let's make a deal.

<p>
He said he'd talk to him.  Gonna start a church where you can save yourself,

<p>
You can make some noise, When you've got no choice...

<p>
You told me useful things, what people think of me, I guess I should thank you.

<p>
It's true, then I agree... I'm all alone, I've got no choice,

<p>
I'm all alone, I've got no choice."

<i>Mark Cutler and Useful Things</i>.  Julie McGinnis does a heavenly cello
on this song and longtime readers just KNOW what I think about cello backings
for rock songs!  This quote will replace Mykey's contribution as the header

<p><br><p><br><i>In My Neighborhood:</i> [still blatantly stealing from Tom Howell]

<p>
Since I was talking about local actor Richard Donelly last issue,
I reminded myself of my favorite Richard Donelly story that I just
can't keep from recounting.
Recall, Richard is an actor AND a plumber.
Well, one of his clients lives on Blackstone Boulevard, where the
house they feature in the TV series Providence is, and these houses
are all pretty pricey.
One Saturday night Richard gets an emergency call from this woman
client because she's having a party and the furnace doesn't seem
to be working.
Richard arrives and rings the front doorbell as he usually does,
but some guests are already there and the hostess asks him if he'd
walk around to the back and go in the back door to the basement.

<p>
Richard complies and goes in the basement and finds the furnace
totally blocked and just minutes from exploding.
He knocks the safety valve off with a wrench and releases the 
pressure just in time, then he cleans the blockage and gets
the furnace up and running, saving the party.
The hostess hurriedly thanks him and pushes him out the backdoor,
still trying to hide Richard from her guests.

<p>
A month or so later, Richard was in a starring role in a play downtown
and after a show goes in our local ``Players Corner Pub" where much
of the acting community hangs out.  
This same woman is there with a big group of friends who had just 
seen the play.
She calls him over, with ``Richard, Richard, come here and meet my
friends, your performance tonight was a real work of art!''

<p>
He walks up to the table, and in his best theatrical voice, intones,
``Lady, what I did to your furnace last month during your party,
THAT was a work of art!" 
Then he walks away.

<p>
<b>THE DEADLINE FOR <i>TINAMOU</i> IS FEBRUARY 21ST</b>

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
I am going to defer rate increases for the moment, but
only until the current series of game starts is completed.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.
These prices are due to increase in the near future so take
advantage of them now.

<p>
<i>More Postal Musings:</i>
I didn't think too carefully about it, but most of you probably noticed
how I made the 99 cent price for the four ounce szine.
When I presented the stack of letters to the postal clerk, the first
comment was, ``wouldn't you just like to buy dollar stamps and take a
one cent loss on each letter?"
I said, ``well, no, I really wouldn't."
But then she figured it out.
``Would you rather have self-stick 33 cent stamps and just put three on
each envelope?"
Ah-ha!
That would do it!!
This turned out to be really easy since the self sticks come in six 
groups of 3 plus two on the card, so you can scoop up the three 
stamps and paste them on in one motion.
Only us pubbers with 100 issues to mail at one time can understand 
the joy at such time saving benefits!
This will really work, especially since the advent of self-stick stamps
has meant that the post office has forgotten how to make lickable
stamps that stay on envelopes (e.g. see the one cent make up stamps
which are another disaster - ha, ha, doesn't bother me, I've used up
all my 32 cent stamps already).

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR AL PEARSON (by #215) AND BERNIE OAKLYN 
(by #220)</center><br></b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>One last issue to find Al Pearson!  
Come on, you guys, someone should be able to find him.
I think it is funny that I seem to get just about half of the 
people I search for, but very few from ``open'' searches.
Most of them come because someone knows where the person
I'm looking for is.
I wanna see more detective work here.
Time for another ``shut down'' threat.
These seem to work.
I'm SHUTTING THIS SZINE DOWN AND FOLDING if someone is not found
very, very soon.
You have six people to choose from at the moment.
Some detective has to get going here.
Why not YOU!!
I've heard that Dan Stafford is just looking for the right
``inducement" to convince him to write to me.
If you gave me his address, I'd send him an issue and if
he responded to me, that would count as YOU winning.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Dan Stafford is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
Jim,
I must remember to vote in your Music Poll. Over here the bull-pen is
something we keep bulls in but I think I get the general idea - it's a
subs bench, right?
<i>((Correct, this is a term from our game of baseball.
It might have evolved from days when stadiums were used for both 
bullfights and baseball games, but probably not.
Anyway, this is the area where the excess pitchers wait to see
if they need to come in and replace the pitcher on the mound.....
stop me.... It's all Emmert's fault.))</i>

<p>
You might also be interested to know that some form of concerted attempt
is being made to revive the postal hobby here in the UK.  For a long time
we were unaware that the postal gaming flyer was no longer being inserted
into the UK Diplomacy box - owing to some confusion the packers at
Gibson's Games were putting the wrong flyer into the box, namely a plug
for Games Games Games mag.

<p>
Anyway, the flyer is back in the box so hopefully we'll start getting
some fresh meat through that.
<i>((I hope so.
I, too, have been trying to be more aggressive about promoting the
postal hobby over here.
I sent a couple of people your way, including our <b>Zine Register</b>
publisher.))</i>

<p>
I spoke to Roger Heyworth of Gibson's and so far as he is concerned his
company's contract with Avalon Hill is still valid and Gibson's can carry
on selling Diplomacy and Civilization in the UK, so if anyone in the USA
is worried about the disappearance of these two classics they can rest
assured that in the worst case scenario they can always import the UK
versions.

<p>
Finally getting to the point I meant to make at the start of this ramble
about the UK hobby, one of the ideas we have had is to set up a web-site
with game openings on it (both Dip and non-Dip).  There's no reason why
this should not be a worldwide thing.  I seem to recall in the last issue
of <i>TAP</i> that someone in the US already does this but is looking to offload
it, in which case they (and anyone else interested in staving off the
extinction of the hobby until the end of the next millennium) might like
to join the Diplomacy Mailing List Stephen Agar has set up on

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/uk_pbm.htm

<p>
At the moment this project is still at the ideas stage.  Ryk Downes is
the one who intends to host the project and the only drawback with Ryk is
that he does an incredible job running umpteen zines, zine polls, hobby
publications for 9 months of the year and then goes missing for 3 months
(I am sure we can all sympathise with those occasions when real life
takes over).  So if we can figure a way to have joint custodianship of
the game opening database that would be my preference.

<p>
<i>((Keep us updated!
I'll join that list.))</i>

<p>
Enough of this, it's time to do some work.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>It also is time to ask for your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
I plan to have my list in NEXT time.
I'm a bit rushed at the moment, but two subszines will keep this issue huge.

<p>

<center>***TIME TO VOTE***</center><br>

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
two songs (5 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
You also get ONE B-52 song vote (although you can add votes from your
main allotment if desired) and THREE Drug Song votes which will be
held in a separate category.
The other ``special'' bullpens must be voted on from your main allotment
of votes.
I decided that I WILL print running totals and print the names of the
people who have voted.
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!

<p>
I have one vote in, but I want to wait until I have at least two before
I start printing them.
Do I have to give things away to get you to vote?
OK, five voters at random will receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff).
I will take these voters at random every other issue, starting with
next issue, and draw one randomly, so early voters get FIVE chances
to win, but no one will be allowed to win twice.
That should do it!

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's

<p>
Dear Jim-Bob (GM version) -

<p>
Today I have taken a step away from the cozy, comfortable
world of government service, and have accepted an offer to
work in the private sector.  You have no idea how I agonized
over this; it's a good financial opportunity, but it will require
that I (eventually) start doing something I've never done before
- rainmaking.  But never mind that; it's off to the world of
chasing dollars.  (Sigh.)  What am I getting myself into,
Jim-Bob?
<i>((I don't know.
I probably will take that leap somehow, some way, some day.
Right now, though, I have two jobs and can't even think about
bailing to the private sector.
But I know what you mean.))</i>

<p>
Hey, anybody out there need a lawyer?
<i>((You should know better than to ask about that with
this crowd.
Can you do anything about Mike Tyson???))</i>

<p>
I am off to Montreal on Friday for a slightly long weekend. 
Tickets to Canadiens-Hurricanes on Saturday afternoon, and
to Canadiens-Penguins Sunday afternoon.  ``Weather
permitting," that is; I think you have to add that language
when you're talking about flying into Quebec in January. 
Despite the fact that the Habs are having a terrible year, I'll
have a blast.  I'll think of you when I go to dinner at Troika, a
Russian restaurant.  Last time I was there, I had pepper
vodka, sevruga caviar, and roasted wild boar.

<p>
Michael Jordan has retired since the last deadline, and now
we're enduring all the paeans to him as The Greatest
Basketball Player Ever, The Greatest Athlete Ever, . . .
really, he might be The Greatest Marketer Ever, but I doubt
the rest of it.
<i>((He certainly doesn't match up against the greatest
cricketers ever....))</i>

<p>
Exhibit A:  Wilt Chamberlain.  How many 100-point games
does Michael have on his resume?  How many times did he
average 50 points a season?  Did they ever change the rules,
to make it fair for the players who played against him?  (They
did that for Chamberlain, widening the lane considerably. 
Otherwise he could do anything he wanted under the
basket.)

<p>
Exhibit B:  Bill Russell.  I'd like to see Michael's ten
championship rings, earned in twelve seasons, please.  And
none of this nonsense about comparing their supporting
casts.  I agree that Cousy, Jones, Jones, etc., were
excellent.  But Pippen and Rodman are, too.  Russell made
everybody on his team better, offensively and defensively.

<p>
Oh, as to the ``Greatest Athlete" nonsense, I usually assign
that title to the reigning world record holder in the decathlon. 
(When Jim Thorpe won the decathlon AND the pentathlon in
the 1912 Olympics, he was awarded the decathlon gold
medal by the King of Sweden, who said, ``Sir, you are the
greatest athlete in the world."  Thorpe replied, ``Thanks,
king.")  But over time?

<p>
I subscribe to the ``mutants" theory.  In every sport (well,
maybe not curling) there is a player who comes along and
blows the old records away by such a margin that you have
to assume they're mutants.  Maybe their records get
gradually bested over time, but these guys raised the bar by
such an enormous margin, it's like they're men playing
against boys.  Chamberlain was one such; nobody could
cover him, with the possible exception of Russell.
<i>((Oh, why not in Curling too??
That's a GREAT sport!!!
Have you ever played it?
It's weirdly fun.
Unfortunately, the only time I really tried to play it, 
I was too young and weak to really ``get the rock off''.
You are really bad, you know...))</i>

The best example of this theory is probably Babe Ruth. 
Eventually, Maris and Aaron and now McGwire and Sosa
have surpassed the most glamorous of his records.  But
Ruth changed the game forever.  Before him, slugging was a
rarity.  Ever hear of Home Run Baker?  He got that nickname
when he hit an incredible number of homer for his day -
something like eleven in a season.  Ruth blew by that record
and didn't break a sweat, hitting 29 in a year and then going
straight to the 50's, ultimately hitting 60 in 1927.  NOBODY
had done anything remotely like that before.

<p>
We are lucky enough to see a mutant right now, actively
playing (albeit toward the end of his career) in Wayne
Gretzky.  Sure, there are guys (usually from western
Pennsylvania - this means you, Fassio) who insist that
Lemieux had better skills, or some from Detroit who say that
Gordie Howe was tougher.  But what it comes down to is
scoring.  Gretzky is SO far ahead of everyone else, it's not
funny.  Last year, he reached a point at which he had
amassed more career assists than anyone else (Gordie is in
second place) had points.  Howe had, I think, 1,851 points
over a long career; Gretzky has something like 2,700 now. 
And he's still playing.

<p>
Jordan probably qualifies as one of the ten greatest
basketball players of all time, but I don't know if I can go
beyond that.

Jim, We're already suffering from Prince's ``1999" overkill in the UK.  I
suggest you remove it from your party list as I think we'll all be sick
of it by the eve of the millennium, but I guess the people will decide.

The ``establishment'', which includes the radio stations, over here really

Thanks for <i>TAP</i> 213. Music of 1998? Well, the best album has to be Beautiful
South's ``Quench", with ``Perfect 10", the single from it as the single of the
year. And having seen them at the forum, I can include them as the best gig
this year. [Yes, I am a fan, by the way.]

Susan Tedeschi - I am going to see her 2/17 in 2,000 seat venue - getting
bigger.  Stole your thunder huh, she has a great voice and does great
shows.  We will be able to blow our own horns about recognizing talent.
<i>((Yeah!  That's OK, actually with your knowledge of blues rootsy
stuff, I would have been surprised if I uncovered something you'd never
seen.))</i>
	
<p>
Stones opened their tour here last night - supposedly amazingly great, as
powerful rock and roll as ever.
<i>((Hmmmm, [raised Spock eyebrow] indeed.))</i>

<p>
Lucinda Williams will be soon after Susan Tedeschi - I liked Graham
Parsons, and will see her not expecting greatness but touchingness.  Those
will be the only two names I will have seen this year.  Not even much
dancing to locals.
<i>((Yeah, Lucinda's on my list too, but she's been around for awhile.
As has been true in recent years, my list will be female top heavy.

Providence the TV show.  I have a TV so Alexander can play games.  I never
turn it on, even for VCR movies.  Across the street from me is the ``police
station" for Nash Bridges and there is often filming going on.  I've never
seen the show - and thought it was a take off on Madison County Bridges,
until Alexander told me Don Johnson was the star - and I do remember he is
in the macho detective mode.

<i>((I'm usually there too.
I've never heard of Nash Bridges and think I could pass Don Johnson on
the street without recognizing him.
The only reason I know about Miami Vice was that I was a Jan Hammer fan
from back in the 1970's.
Well, that's it, another issue down.
Usually, this is the last page I type before printing, and it is this

That's why there can be lots of foreshadowing in the letters section
on what comes after.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>One more regular game will be started now, then there probably won't
be a regular opening for a very long time.
You can send your $15 for your life of the game sub and
game fee with NMR insurance.
Richard Pinelli ($15), Jim Sayers ($20), Roland Sasseville, Harold Zarr, 
and Dan Gorham are currently in line for the next regular Diplomacy game.
Send money now and sign up!
Only two more are needed.
Show Conrad von Metzke that he is out to lunch as usual.
The postal regular Dip hobby is not dead, there just aren't
enough GMs opening game starts.

<p>
I also am trolling for players for Colonia VIIb (we need nine in 
total - Austria, China, England, France, Netherlands, Ottomans,
Portugal, Russia, and Spain).
I have direct interest expressed from Scott Morris,
David Partridge, Robert Stimmel ($15), Heath Gardner,
John Power ($15), Paul Rauterberg, Gene Prosnitz, and 
Stan Johnson.
I need just ONE more player to begin.
It's definitely time to send money and preference lists if 
you haven't already.
Do I have the right listings up there from people who have
paid already??
Remember that if I don't have preference lists from everyone
it will be a random draw.
I think I only have two preference lists so far.

<p>
Ummm, never mind.... you may have noticed that I left a bit of
the Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Black Hole game start in this 
section last time. 
No, I am not opening a second game....
I also changed the game name at the last minute because one
of the players objected to the Nelson Mandela name.
I thought who better deserves a Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire
game named after them than Saddam?
After all, the original Evil Empire is just a bit of a joke now.

<p>
Breaking Away has continual openings, see the sign-up list under 
the game below.

<p>
I have an opening for a game of Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I'll take input on this idea.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Species 8472 has been in two segments of Voyager and is a very intriguing
diplomatic race (their episodes are the only Voyager episodes I've liked
in the last year) and the rest of the races should be well known to all.
No interest in this game?
I really want to run this.
I guess I gotta work on my map and publish it.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke is the editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117
(E-Mail: metzke of san.rr.com).
Conrad is discussing folding this service.
I think actually it needs someone to pick it up with a web page
where it can be posted.
I'd like to nudge Stephen Agar into talking to Conrad about taking
it over and putting in the postal section on <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i>
page, where this szine also resides.
This appears to be happening, though it is not official yet to my knowledge.
This could serve both the Brit and US hobbies!!
I realize that I should probably volunteer to do this since I'm the most
active contributor to that page, but I'd really rather not.
What we need is for the postal openings to be accessible on the Net.

Flashman - ``Damn it, you know I don't like being alone with you,

<p>
Pope - setting aside his beloved, dog-eared copy of the 
<i>Song of the Bhagavad-Gita</i> but not bothering to get out of bed.
``Oh, quiet!
You know I'm not all THAT bad!
Now I need to know what these vagabonds about us are up to.''

Flashman - strutting about the grotesquely over-decorated room, Fingering
various flashy trinkets.
``Hrumph... Quite tacky..." (noticing a peevish look from the Pope)
``Oh!  To business then!
It would appear that to our north we have some unsettling news.
The Frogs and Germs appear to be trying to expand by leaps and bounds,
and I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it.''

<p>
Pope - Rolling onto his side and scratching his ass gratuitously,
with a look of pleasure working its way across his face.
``What the Hell do I care?
As long as they STAY north, I don't give a damn... Oh yeah....
That's the spot...'' (remembering himself)
``Ahem!
Now, what about those heathens to the east of us?
You know, the `Vun Vith the dumb accent' and that Turk with the
wild hair?''

<p>
Flashman - obviously appalled, but trying to ignore the sweating heap
of flesh on the bed.
``The turk appears to be unconcerned with our beloved Italy.
A good thing in my opinion.
As for the Austrian fellow, he appears to be a bit `off', you 
might say.''

<p>
Pope - with the emitting of light flatulence.
``How do you mean?''

<p>
Flashman - fighting back tears.  Deciding to open a window.
``I'm afraid he can't be trusted.
A completely unstable individual.
Ahhh...
That breeze feels good....
Reports have come in suggesting more than a mere erratic thought
process going on over there.
He appears to be in his own world, sir.''

<p>
Pope - Sitting up, a surprisingly quick movement for him.
``Damn it!
I knew something was up with that guy!
Do the military advisors suggest any course of action?''

Flashman - Charming grin in place.
``But of course, your Holiness....''

(CURIOUS PERSON to MIKE BARNO): Do you really have a dog named
MaryJane?

<p>
(MIKE BARNO to HIKERS LIKE THE CITY-BOY OZOG BROTHERS):  Thanks to my
dog I walked 384 miles in 1998.  All but 20 of that was with my dog, but
she probably made up that much ground running around in long loops when
I could let her off the leash.  Together we hiked canyons, walked atop
high rock fins, camped in tundra and desert, wandered through woods. 
Before turning on to Yellowstone I hardly walked a mile a year.

and will have a new e-mail address to give you then.  If you
want to zap me at this address, you can probably do so until
about March 31-April 1 or so.  For the month of April, well,
don't count on it, as I'll be away from home most of the time,
but you can try me at:  semmert of concentric.net.  I just don't
log on at that address every day.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ITALY): Gee, I sure didn't change your plans!

<p>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND/GERMANY): You may think I am out, but I have
not yet begun to fight.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ENGLAND): What can I say?  You were right!

<p>
(AUSTRIA - GERMANY): Okay, scratch that idea.  I admit, that was a bit too 
visionary coming from Austria.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ALL): Hey, a perfect theme song for this game would be ``Dogs'' 
from Pink Floyd's <i>Animals</i> album: 
     
<p>
``You have to be trusted, by the people that you lie to... 

<p>
So that when they turn their back on you... 

<p>
You'll get the chance to put the knife in..."

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE):  I take it this means you'll try
to schedule TWO deadlines for the month of April, just to
bedevil me.

<p>
(PROVIDENCE to VIRGINIA BEACH): I don't know, probably.
You can count weeks as well as I can.... 

<p>
(SPIDER to ORANGEMAN): How's it looking for March Madness? 
I think you can count Richmond out this year (10-8, and no
real prospect of winning the conference tournament), so
maybe you guys can make it to the second round.

<p>
(BOOB ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL): Syracuse actually looks in some trouble too,
after losing a flock of home games at their usually safe Carrier Dome.
My prediction is that they still will make it into the NCAA tournament safely,
but they will have the lowest seed among the Big East teams (six of them?
UConn, Miami, St. John's as complete locks; Rutgers, Villanova have now
made it in if they don't stumble; and Syracuse takes a spot from the A-10
since the A-10 gets just three - Temple, George Washington, and Xavier).
Sharp-eyed readers will realize that this leaves BOTH local RI teams on
the outside looking in as the top Big East and A-10 entrants in the NIT.
This past weekend pretty much sealed the deal as Providence lost to
Rutgers and Rhode Island lost to Temple.  In each case, they needed to
win those games to stay in contention with the teams they lost to.
This is true, even though Providence was one of those teams that beat
Syracuse in the Carrier Dome (those of you who know us, know this is
a ``brother vs. brother'' rooting battle, as David is a Syracuse grad).
Both teams share the burden and blessing 
of a superstar that could be an All-America
selection and are near certain NBA stars (Jamel Thomas for Providence
and Lamar Odom for Rhode Island), so anything can happen in the last
three weeks though.
Both Thomas and Odom are great players who also play unselfishly for
the team, to a fault.
Also, sometimes their teams will get out of the game while watching
them play.
The college game is NOT a superstar game. 
And both teams also have real serious weaknesses too.
Providence is still playing a 6'5" center, Erron Maxey, who should 
get an MVP award for best player in the country playing out of position.
Rhode Island still has only one consistent guard, Preston Murphy, when
he isn't injured or sick - which makes him not very consistent.
I'll be rooting for both down teams down the stretch and then in the
conference tournaments.
Coaches Jim Harrick and Tim Welch have done great jobs through lots of 
adversity.
A couple of other notes, Mike Barno, pay attention!
The UConn women's team has been through a bit more adversity than usual
this year, but they finally handed the ball to my favorite Husky, 
Shea Ralph (who amazingly made just her FIRST collegiate start)
against Boston College this week and she scored 36 points!
As I said a couple of years ago, if Ralph stays healthy and plays,
go UConn!!!
She missed the tournament as a frosh, the entire season last year, 
and NOW (with UConn's other injuries) finally gets to be a starter.
Finally, everyone noted the game of the year the other night?
Penn was leading Princeton 33-9 at the half, 40-13 with about
15 minutes left and LOST THE GAME by one!!!
Whoooo, boy, baby. 
Ah, college basketball, it don't get no better than this,
even with Brother Ricky P's Traveling Salvation Show back
in action on the parquet.
Hmmm, every time I go on and on about college basketball, it
leaves the Brits scratching their heads, what to do, what to do??

<p>
(EQUAL TIME FOR CRICKET NEWS!!!!): Kumble takes all 10 wickets as 
India rout Pakistan

<p>
NEW DELHI, Feb 7 (AFP) - Leg-spinner Anil Kumble grabbed all 10 wickets
in an innings as India crushed Pakistan by 212 runs in the second Test here
on Sunday to square the short two-match series. 
Kumble emulated Englishman Jim Laker's feat against Australia 43 years
ago, finishing with 10-74 from 26.3 overs in a sensational finish to Pakistan's
first Test series on Indian soil in 12 years. 
The 28-year-old computer engineer proved unplayable on the dusty
Ferozeshah Kotla track as Pakistan, chasing a mammoth target of 420,
were shot out for 207 an hour after tea on the fourth day.

<p>
(BOOB to LESS THAN CRICKET SENSITIVE TAPITES): This is a HUGE accomplishment.
Only two ten wicket performances in hundreds of years of cricket?
It's more rare as an individual performance
than a perfect game in baseball, 100 points in a game in
basketball, or ten goals in one game in hockey!
Four days for a game, gee, I don't know....

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY):  Gee, I don't know what you mean.  I'M
friendly.

<p>
(ITALY to GERMANY):  You ask too many questions.  Let's just
say I want Russia in Sweden and leave it at that.

<p>
(TURK to TSAR):  Sorry for my insistence that we bounce.  But
my way, neither of us can possibly get stabbed.

<p>
(SULTAN to KAISER): I will keep my end of the communicating
bargain (with the possible exception of parts of April) as long
as you do.  Ain't it great when Dip players write to each
other?

<p>
(ANKARA): The sultan today announced the next step in his
policy of liberalizing the nation's traditional prohibitions, by
proclaiming that henceforth, the official single malt scotch of
the empire will be Laphroaig.  We figure this is proprietary,
as no one else will be able to pronounce or spell it anyway. 
Harry Andruschak is hereby appointed the Keeper of the
Official Liquor Cabinet.  Hey, if we can trust eunuchs in the
harem, we can trust Harry with the scotch.
<i>((Indeed!!!))</i>

<p>
(TURK to HAPSBURG):  How did you get that swell collection of
Italian soldiers?  Neato-coolo.  Are you gonna collect green
boats, too?

<p>
(SULTAN to MONSIEUR LE PRESIDENTE):  I figure you can avoid
losing any dots if you just send in reverse orders from what
you submitted for the spring.  Order everybody back home,
and you keep it all.  I'll waive the normal fee for this advice.

<p>
(PUNSTER): The two ten-year-old boys really didn't like the
neighboring beekeeper.  He was always shooing them away
from the hives, and in a very unpleasant way.  They decided
to play a trick on him.  One day, they set up a fake hive right
next to the real one, and threw a blanket (camouflage variety)
over the real one.  They then hid nearby to watch.  Sure
enough, when the honeybees came back from their long day
at the office, they flew right at what they though was the
entrance to the hive, and BAM! they slammed into the
painted wooden ``door" to the fake hive, sustaining fatal head
injuries.  A steady mound of dead honeybees thus grew at
the base of the fake hive - honeybees are far too stupid to
learn from each other's mistakes - much to the glee of the
kids.  A passerby, noting what was going on, muttered to
himself, ``Lord, what bees these mortals fool."

<p>
Endure your PUNishment with dignity, Jim-Bob.  There's
more coming.  Best wishes.
<i>((Hey, no prob, bro.
I love puns.))</i>

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> GM):  The Russian player's name is ``Russ Russnak"?  
Who are you trying to fool?  What next, a Turkish player named Turkey
Lurkey?  An English player named ``Tall Man?"  

<p>
(BOOB to FAILING THIRD GRADER CARTMAN): That's Rusnak, not Russnak and
sure Russ is real.
I've met him, been in his house, ridden in his czar.... I mean car.
I think they invented the concept of retention just for you....

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> RUSS RUSSNAK, IF THAT REALLY IS YOUR NAME): 
So excited to see the Livonia opening!  My fav!  

<p>
(BOOB to SHOWING HINTS OF PASSING CARTMAN): Well, at least you have
good taste in openings.
What will we see as the next move in that opening, Mr. Smarty Pants?
Send it in for next issue and if you get it right, we'll think about
letting you move on to fourth grade.
Oh, yes, all triple entendres are definitely on purpose.
Take that, Emmert!!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I bet I got everything right this time!!
Onward ho!
Looks like some people are going to cross the first sprint finish 
line next turn.
Note it lies between squares 40 and 41.
Also note that I process things from the front to the back of the pack.
I put the three riders on Square 29 in the order they are likely to
move next turn, Curly will certainly move first since he is the
Stooges ``A'' rider.

<p>
2) Since I like this game and am learning how to do this and have to
put my new knowledge to good use, I will start another game.
I'll keep the sign-up list here so that interested parties will see it
as they peruse the szine.
All games will start when they have precisely six players and for the moment
I will keep the game opening list always on.
This game will continue to be free, like Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire.
Currently in line for the next game are: 
David Partridge, Rick Desper, Eric Brosius and John Schultz.
No problem with almost all of you current players playing another one.
David has volunteered to run the game in <i>Tinamou</i> if I want to
play.... I'll think about that.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font

<p>

falters.  However, some Stooge looks like he's about to steal some of the

too.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
2) Some background discussion occurred this season on the use of wings.
The air arm rules are documented on the Modern Dip web page cited above.
Though it was pretty obvious that everyone would not agree to adopt
wing rules in the middle of the game, and indeed at least one person
vetoed the idea, I think the discussion convinced me that if I run
this again (probably not until this game ends), I will try the wings.
Thanks to all for their input!

<p>
3) I want to thank all of you for some truly exceptional press this time.
I like this kind of stuff that is easy to mix into a great story!
Keep up the good work.
Sorry for the semi-sour note that it ends on.... but all great stories
have their tough times.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): I have a guest artist this issue.
Stanley Matis is a character in the Providence based rock and roll
movie <i>Complex World</i>.  
This is a really neat movie, should you be able to locate it in a
video store.
Anyway, Stanley is this really weird guy who is looking to blow
up our local rock and roll club, Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel.
The Mekons gave one of the greatest concerts I have ever seen in 
Lupo's, so.....
 
<p>
``You know what's wrong with you people? You're ignorant. 
 
<p>
You don't know anything. But there's hope for you yet. 
 
<p>
You're all going to die - someday. Death makes you smart.

<p>
You can take a complete idiot and kill him (or her) and 

<p>
he knows more than the smartest person alive: he knows what death is. 

<p>
So don't worry. Help is on the way.''

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> GM):  Oh, and now I'm supposed to believe that the guy
playing Poland is named ``Roland".  Right!  

<p>
(BOOB to PESKY CARTMAN): Believe anything you like, this szine is
reality. 

<p>
(UKRAINE - RUSSIA): Haven't heard from you since the first game year.
Hope you got my note.  Hopefully it is appropriate to welcome you back
to Mos.

<p>
(BOOB to DAVID): I guess the lines were down or the generals failed to
give the order to attack.

<p>
(THE PEOPLE to THE PROPHET): O voice of the Desert.
O magnificent voice from beyond!
Speak to us.
Speak O Barno!

<p>
(WILLIAM REHNQUIST to U.S. SENATE): ``The Law is the true embodiment
of everything that's excellent, it has no kind of fault or flaw,
and I, my Lords, embody the law!''

<p>
(BOOB to SUPREME COURT WATCHERS): Hey, it's not me, it's Barno.
Barno embodies the LAW!
Hyork, hyork, hyork!!!

<p>
(UKRAINE to GENERAL STATEMENT): Have you tried extrapolating that
theorem on two front wars to four front wars?  I'm doing some lab work
for a thesis on that at the moment!

<p>
(BOOB to UKRAINE): Let's ask the all time expert on four front wars....

<p>
(FILE ARTICLE #207): It would seem that I was incorrect.
Saddam still lives!
I was hoping the Egyptians had taken care of the man.
Now he begins trouble near Turkish borders.
Perhaps it is time again to contact the Americans....

<p>
(UKRAINE to GENERAL STATEMENT (II)):  I strongly recommend that you give
the Colonia game that Jim is offering a try.  With powers having
colonies, the concept of independent allies becomes almose normal, and
one even has the very real possibility of fighting a particular power
on one front while working with it on another.  I've only played one
full game of it and part of another and that has happened to me!
<i>((One last spot is left, first volunteer gets it!))</i>

<p>
(BERLIN to KIEV): Our receipt of your threat to ``throw the works to
Turkey" if we double-crossed you did the trick: we want to see if you'll
follow through with it!  It would be so silly to throw dots to the
Sultan, necessitating more Ukr removals, when you are standing against
invasions from all sides: that is something a snot-nosed kid might
threaten, sure, but a decent player?  Really?

<p>
(LATIN BLACK PRESSER-GM): Utinam barbari spatium proprium tuum invadant!
May barbarians invade your personal space!

<p>
(BOOB opines):  The question is whether barbarians are decent players!!

<p>
(ME-THE PERSON TAKING/GIVEN CREDIT FOR THE LATIN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE): 
It is I who have provided you with foreign quoteds and excerpts from
<i>The Prince</i>.

<p>
(ARMY PRUSSIA to WARSAW): We don't like Kielbassa, Pierogis' and Blood
Soup, anyway.  We'll stick to good, wholesome German fare until the
Ukrainian chow finds its way to our table!

<p>
(ERIC-JIM-BOB): This is one of the rare moments when I did not
``Triple-flip." Woe to Ukraine!

<p>
(TURKISH 3RD ARMY to THE UKRAINIAN ARMY IN VOL): In the infamous words
of the renown personage of Mike Barno, we scream with all our might:
``Get Dead!!!''

<p>
(ERIC-DAVE): Sorry, but there was just too much anti-Ukraine inertia coming
from the rest of your neighbors and I was sucked into this  maelstrom of
the Dark Side.  It is a whirlpool of evil.  Release the dogs of war!

<p>
(THE SULTAN to THE WORLD POWERS): By Allah's Grace we shall overcome!
I wish to thank all of the Brave Souls who have joined us in this ``Mother
of All Battles''.
May Glory find its way to you and your people....

<p>
(AMBASSADOR PARTRIDGE to AMBASSADOR POLLACK): Thank you for your kind
praise.  While the policies of your government left us no choice but to
go to war with your nation, we will gladly attest that you have always
been an honorable and worthy foe.  You are sir a true gentleman.  I
apologize for the lack of correspondence, it has not been anything
personal.  I was going to say that I've been no better with my allies,
but looking around I'm having trouble finding anyone who qualifies for
that label.  Hmmm, maybe there's a correlation here?  Four on one odds
might be a bit long even for the students at our War College!  What's
that phrase, win the battle and lose the war?

<p>
(ROME-KIEV): I still have doubts about how allied my allies will be with me
in the future, but I'm a gamblin' man.  Hopefully I won't end up getting
squeezed between them, but I know you won't shed any tears (and
rightfully so) if I do.  I think Italy is damned either way but believe
that it will be later than sooner.

<p>
(P to U OR PU): I am truly sorry.
It was the Huns I should have been more wary of and now perhaps I die.
I go knowing that I have some friends left on the board.
I never go without a fight.
<i>((Looks again, me hearty.
You ain't dead yet!!))</i>

<p>
(ROME-PARIS): Yes, we are evil.  And Paul is the evilest of us all!

<p>
(FILE ARTICLE #415): The People of Iran are outraged!
A call to arms is immediate.
Too many foreign invaders have dared to cross into their nation!
It is an ill omen....

<p>
(ROME-ANKARA &amp; CAIRO): Okay gentlemen, I've cast my fortunes with the
likes of you for better or worse-we shall be nourished and grow strong
on the flesh and blood of Ukraine.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR AT&#196;TURK P&#214;-LLARD to THE WORLD): It is my intention to
simply hold on to as much Turkish territory as possible this year.
Buy time and hope that New Alliances, New Coalitions will carry my people
through these trying times...
I pray that I have done well.

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): In Madeliene Albright as Russia I was expecting a war 
since I am terrible with Russia. I'm better and would have picked Italy 
over Russia any day so it wasn't a surprise and I resigned after the 
spring move due to reasons of discussion with Sara and I felt that it 
was not worth playing with it plus the fact I have no money to keep 
playing a lost cause which me and Russia is S01 so oh well. My ego is a 
0.00 it goes quite well with me self esteem which is abnormally high at 
the present times.

<p>
(OJ SIMPSON to U.S. SENATE): Have Clinton try on Lewinsky's dress.
If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): I did notice, but am hoping that you stay north of me 
please? Is it ok to demilitarize the Mao to keep from any 
misunderstandings?
<i>((Did you forget that he has a fleet SOUTH of you?
Just checking....))</i>

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> PLAYERS): Folks, check out the Modern HoF homepage, address
listed above!  The champ for '98 was a guy named ``Eric Person".
Sounds like yet another of Burgess's fake people, doesn't it!
Vincent Mous is going to try to organize a Modern game for WDC at
Namur.  Maybe we'll use air units!  : 

<p>
(FILE ARTICLE #420): Mr. Andruschak!
It is with much regret that I must inform you that because of this recent
decree, I am forced to extradite you back to my country!
There are several young women who have filed complaints against you 
after your recent visit.
I am afraid you will have to participate in several tests which will
reveal if indeed you are the father of several unborn children...
Forgive me.
It is the will of the Sultan....

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Another time scramble.
Maybe this should be my last game in <i>TAP</i>???
(Other than standby for 3, 2, or 1 dot positions.)
<i>((Well, I certainly hope not!!!))</i>
Or at least my last game until I retire, run out of money,
or otherwise have to stay put.
Yes, I went on my vacation 17-30 January, and it was wonderful.
Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, Inc.
really delivers the goods.
Yet I wonder if Windjammer can stay in business?
They took a huge financial bloodbath with the loss of S/V FANTOME to
hurricane Mitch last October, and now the liability lawyers are moving
in for the kill.
<i>((Is it not allowed to be insured because a hurricane is an act
of God?
No business at risk like that would stay uninsured willingly, I wouldn't
think.
I know Lloyd's of London always used to insure things like that, have
their financial problems led this market to collapse??
They should have had both liability insurance AND insurance for the
loss of the ship itself.))</i>
And the grieving for the lost crew members of FANTOME cast a deep
shadow over the cruise.
Two of the female crew members of MANDALAY had fiances on the FANTOME.

<p>
Yet the ship I was on, S/V MANDALAY, was packed full with the usual 72
passengers and 28 crew.
Windjammer has an astonishing repeat rate.
<i>((The fact that it has a high repeat rate is not the same as an
astonishing one.
Knowing both people who do this as crew and passengers, I am less than
surprised.
I would have thought it was even higher!))</i>
Over 60% of its passengers have been on a Windjammer cruise before,
and that figure rises to 80% for MANDALAY.
No other cruise line has anything like this loyalty, and that loyalty
may be what saves Windjammer Barefoot Cruises from the liability lawyers.
<i>((Perhaps, and I certainly hope the business survives, but
other types of cruises are an entirely different animal.
Sailing ships like Windjammer and Carnival cruise ships 
share almost nothing as vacation entertainment 
other than that they both travel on the ocean.))</i>
R.I.P. S/V Fantome, 1927-1998.

<p>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to WHOEVER): So, thanks a lot for the explanation
of what <i>TAP</i> stands for.
So I have just one more question, what does <i>TAP</i> stand for???

<p>
(THE BOOB to EVERYONE): To some degree, we are about to find out.
We have a difficult one here, and here I go.... I think it stands
for fairness, balance, and respect for others.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to HARRY): I now see some sense of what the background
was on the press you wrote last issue to Jeff.
He has a written a detailed response, which I was going to
print, but finally decided not to print.
I want to state pretty emphatically that I am not at all interested
in having abortion debates in the szine, so I first thought
about not publishing Jeff's press and then thought I decided
that he had a right of response.
After I started to type it, I realized that he was getting so
detailed that you would not want to abide by my further decision
that was not going to permit further responses.
Abortion is one of those issues that is so polarizing that
it destroys the forum in which it is discussed.
I don't intend to have that happen here.
I won't print any further discussion by either of you 
on that subject, though
you two are of course free to do whatever you like elsewhere.
Remember that us on the coasts sometimes have little idea what
society is like elsewhere in our country..... this is why some
people call this cultural war as dangerous as the Civil War
was in the last century.
I hope you understand my position.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to JEFF O'DONNELL): I know you won't like my decision
not to permit your response to Harry to be published here.
It isn't often that I censor press, but I am protecting the
szine here.
I will fall back on my house rules which require you to abuse
the GM to a greater degree than you attack the positions of
Harry's.
It also requires you to keep things in the spirit of the game and fun.
You have not done that, though certainly you are discussing
extremely serious issues.
You may choose to attack the GM in response to this press item and 
are free to do so.
I will be pleased to print any attacks you have to make on me,
as always, as long as you stick to the premise that I don't intend
to permit debate on the substance of the issues surrounding abortion
rights.
I am extremely sympathetic to how difficult the issue of abortion
is for all sides (individuals as well as groups) and this type of
format is a terrible way to debate them, sure to raise hard feelings,
and sure to destroy the forum.
Please don't take this action personally, and actually, 
I thought you put some careful thought into your press.
But sometimes you just have to slam the door shut.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to ANYONE OFFENDED BY HARRY'S COMMENTS LAST ISSUE): I 
apologize to you for not catching where this was going sooner.
Usually I am more vigilant.
I cocked my head at it, but didn't really think about it.

<p>
(JIM-BOB to THOSE TERRIBLY CONFUSED AND HAVING NO IDEA WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT): Never mind, on to the next game....

<p>
1) Thanks for the increased press!
I hope there is equivalent movement on the negotiation front!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> GM): So in this game, Britain is played by a 
``son of York".  
Geez, could you be a little more inventive with your fake names?

<p>
(F-WORLD): The French colonial government continues 
to mourn the passing
of the British monarch. We question the judgement of the apparently
inbred King Andrew who has became the successor.
The diversion of resources to the British front is an unfortunate 
necessity.
                        
<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> F):  Paranoid?  

<p>
(F-A): Oh Andy dear, o did you hear the news that's going round...
when you take a spot that others had... 
you must really play it sound.
Why did you not even entertain the plans previously made by the 
English king?

<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font

<p>
(F-J): Glad to see you in the electronic age.

<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> J):  Hiya!

<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> T):  Shall we start addressing you as The Egyptian?

<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> R):  Trade positions?

<p>
(R-R): I guess our coordination could have been better 
but it is working out so far. 
I still insist that my prediction is true. You have not
commented on it, so you must still be considering.
  
<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> C):  Shall we start administering last rites?  

<p>
(H -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> H):  Look, you can write reams of material about the ``Trial of
the Century"  (the second one in the past 5 years) but can't come up
with decent press for this game!  Lame!

<p>
(SKYWALKER-BOOB): Sorry, Jim, I just don't have much to say anymore.
<i>((Well, some of the others do....))</i>

<p>
(HOLLAND): The Dutch government would like to regret the 
lack of good press emanating from its offices in recent days.  
Since the kids went off to that bike race, we can't even, 
um, even, finish um,...

<p>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) All draws and concessions are still rejected.
With summer orders please vote on a concession to Germany, and FG, FGT, GT, and
FGTA draw proposals.

<p>
2) Note that Rick Davis has changed his address.
This is just a bit interesting now.
Let's see what happens next, shall we?
On to some more great press!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GM to PLAYERS): ``A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!!''
Here we go with some world class GM abuse.... keep it comin' guys!!

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM BOB): I wanted to show Richard that I not only
knew what draw lines were but had broken a few on my way south.
If I got to type them in, then the least the GM should do is
happily and cheerfully type them in also.
<i>((But I categorically REFUSE to admit the existence of stalemate
lines.
They are a figment of the imagination and I will go to any lengths,
yes, any lengths, to destroy them.
If you like, I could type them in and THEN ridicule them.))</i>
I answered Richard's press and in fact blew him away with my knowledge
of stalemate lines, and superior knowledge of the game in general,
and you ruined my wonderful press release.
<i>((I will not perjure myself, nor will I obstruct justice.
I fully and completely admit to ruining your wonderful press release....
ummmm, but I guess it wasn't so wonderful.))</i>

<p>
<a href="/Online/StalematesAtoY/">
Stalemates A to Y</a>

<p>
(BOOB to STALEMATE DRAW LINE AFICIONADOS): These fingers will not
type out draw lines, but they will tell you where to find them.
The enclosed pages (courtesy of Manus Hand's <i>The Diplomatic
Pouch</i>) direct anyone with Internet access to MORE than they
ever wanted to know about these alleged lines.
They disappear just like lines of coke....

<p>
(TUR-GER): You are aware, and apparently wrote out some draw lines.  Were
your opponents ever in one/have access to one? You are fully correct that I
blew this game and should have had a solo or a great shot at it.  My play
is not sour grapes however - only the nectar of the gods grows in TUR or
GRE!
	
<p>
If I have been able to make Harold think some and modify his usual style,
and even become vengeful, the ``shadow side" of one's personality is okay
also.  I condone Dip as a game to learn about oneself - the more usual
virtuous/self-promoted side and the shadow side also.  Harold, you in the
3rd person, hope it was as good for you as for the Germ and the Turkey.
	
<p>
Charles, you've never seen wild press before?  You've never seen black
press, even in a zine that flaunts it's use?  You've never had guest
commentators drawn into the game?  Hmmm, well, thank you then.  Thank you
very much.

<p>
<i>((All these things are actively encouraged in this szine.))</i>
	
<p>
I've written press for every country and under almost every by line
imaginable, including stealing various ones that others have used, and
sometimes impersonating someone stealing my bylines.  Not that I have
multiple personalities or anything.  The best part was when Boob didn't
remember to edit out the italics, and I appeared to be him.  That was hard,
though, since he is a Boob!

<p>
<i>((Seldom imitated, never topped.))</i>

<p>
(OF COMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES): Then it's decided a letter of censure
will be sent to Mr. Jim Bob Burgess for his refusing to type the
full and complete press in <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #213.
<i>((Do both sides of the aisle support this lame suggestion....))</i>
Yes; draw lines are an important aspect of this game and should be
graciously typed by GM's around the world!
<i>((Anyone who believes in these lines, is welcome to consult the
archived articles on the <b>Diplomatic Pouch</b> web page.
No GM in his right mind, who also shares my mind on this issue, would
do so, no matter which country they are from....))</i>
Jim is the only GM who has ever refused, in the history of the hobby.
<i>((That's a long time, and a lot of GM's.
Would you care to prove this??))</i>
This committee must show its disapproval of Jim's disagreeable 
behavior, and give him an admonition to change his attitude.
We must condemn this type of attitude whenever it creeps into
the hobby.

<p>
(BOOB): If it gets a belly laugh, it counts.

<p>
(TUR-FRA):  Harold.  I do have limits.  I do cross other people's limits. 
Part of the wonderfulness of the Hasbro game (Jim, did you notice no one
even ventured a guess or attempted to win a free year's sub - how do you
spell that dude Calamityhammer's name?) is that one can experiment and
learn.  Easier than in relationships, easier than on the motorcycle, easier
than on a seven day fast through the high sierras.  And more fun than
simply contemplating one's navel on the pathless path.

<p>
(BOOB to ALLAN CALHAMER): You know that I, alone, am the keeper of your flame.

<p>
(TUR-MIKEY): Bombs away old chap.  This game is about to be officially
over, and the Toady will have 2 SC's!  Too bad that is the only solace I
can find in having blown another shot at getting a HOF score!
	
<p>
(TUR-RICK): There is another con coming up in Feb probably - I know it is
not grape season or high wine making season, so what will be your excuse
this time?  

<p>
(BOOB to BAY AREA CALIFORNIANS): Any chance of one on the weekend of
April 24-25?
If so, I can practically guarantee my attendance (well, at least on 
Saturday night and Sunday) since I am going to a conference the preceding
couple of days at Berkeley.
Think about it and let me know.
	
<p>
(TUR-BOOB): Again, great game, great gming.  I'd vote for the draw but I
want to see FRA actually get to be the same size as AUS!!!!
