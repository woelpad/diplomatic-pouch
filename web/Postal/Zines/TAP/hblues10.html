<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those traveling across North Carolina in the next few 
years may sense that more road maintenance work that usual is 
going on across the Tar Heel state. You would not be 
imagining things &#173; the General Assembly has made nearly a half 
billion dollars available over the next three years. While 
allocating certainly is welcome news, the situation also highlights 
North Carolina's persistent misallocation of road money. Until 
road priorities are determined by sound engineering practice 
and not politics, such transfers cannot address the state's 
larger underlying problem.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's no secret that North Carolina has not done a 
particularly good job of maintaining its road network over the 
past decade or more. The problem was highlighted in a 1998 
performance review of the Department of Transportation, 
which noted that the agency only had just over half the money 
each year it needed to met its own resurfacing goals. The audit 
also noted that this was not a new occurrence; DOT had fallen 
well short of these goals since at least 1990. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of such under funding is predictable; road 
condition deteriorates. Drivers, of course, face bumpier rides 
on streets that have more potholes in them. And there are no 
lack of state roads with potholes and patch jobs. Even the roads 
in the state's primary network are being resurfaced only 
about every 16 years on average instead of every 12 years as is 
recommended. Overall, 41 percent of the state's roads are in 
fair or poor condition. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as troubling as the quantity of roads needing work 
is their distribution. Recently only one county, Gates, with 
more than 15 percent of its roads rated in poor condition was east 
of Forsyth County, compared to 18 such counties west of 
Guilford. Clearly the state's allocation formula has provided good 
roads for some North Carolinians and not others. It is also difficult 
to find any justification why over a quarter of the roads in 
Rowan County in 1998 had deteriorated into &quot;poor condition&quot;, 
when the state average was 7.9 percent.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While road maintenance has been grossly underfunded,
<TD COLSPAN=1>
<TD COLSPAN=1 HEIGHT=588 WIDTH=246 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">another fund has run a large unspent surplus. In 1989, the 
state increased the gas tax and certain fees to build more roads. 
This extra money goes into the specially established Highway 
Trust Fund.  In the grand political tradition, the Highway Trust 
Fund offered something for just about everyone. Exactly 61.95 
percent of the money goes for 28 intrastate road projects 
specified by the General Assembly, with an additional 25.05 
percent going to seven urban loop projects. The remaining 13 
percent is split evenly between paving dirt roads and giving extra 
money to cities for their own roads. Once the projects are 
complete, the extra taxes will end. All other state road projects in 
the state continue to be funded through the existing Highway Fund.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The list of trust Fund projects certainly reflects the 
political realities of 1989 &#173; a grand trade off to ensure votes 
from both urban and rural areas. A funding formula even 
controls how money for the intrastate is distributed across the state. 
In practice, it assures that the western and eastern parts of 
the state get more road funding sooner then could be justified 
by either population or road usage. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One major disadvantage of this approach has become 
increasingly obvious in recent years. Just because funds are 
available for intrastate projects now doesn't mean the 
specified projects actually currently can use that level of funding. In 
fact, many projects have hit snags or are still in the planning 
stages. The Highway Trust Fund only needs about half of its 
current balance of some $800 million. This has allowed the 
General Assembly to put $153 million this fiscal year into 
maintenance, with an additional $ 317 million to follow over the coming 
two years. Other Trust Fund money has been diverted to transit 
and to help close the state's budget deficit. In theory, these 
diversions should be repaid in the future, though the mechanism 
for doing so hasn't been identified.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, the state has a huge backlog of 
Highway Fund projects. A 1998 audit noted that the state was 
facing a $2.1 billion shortfall for projects in its then current 
seven-year plan. All identified projects DOT's on books would 
take 26 years to complete at 1998 funding levels.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such inequities and funding shortfalls are hardly 
surprising when good roads are regarded not as a basic service 
provided by the state but rather a s a prize to be won through 
political favors. This political process, however, does not do 
a good job of ensuring that the road dollars are spent where 
they will do the most good. Until good economic and 
engineering practice take precedence over small time politics, the 
current transfers to road maintenance not withstanding, North 
Carolina drivers will be hitting a lot more potholes than they 
need to.
