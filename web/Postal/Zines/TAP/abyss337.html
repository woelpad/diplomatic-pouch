<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.

<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started in January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my next game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

DIPLOMACY: First off, another regular Diplomacy game is open.  Doug Kent and Brad
Wilson are in, anyone else?

BREAKING AWAY: Also, a new Breaking Away game is open. 
Currently Andy York is on board.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Here we go, back in business.  Thanks to Marc for playing out the German position.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to WORLD):  I can't remember who stated this war, why it started, or even who my enemies are anymore.   That said, I'm out to be on the winning side!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ENGLAND): Sorry you had to wait so long, you win the prize this turn for the most builds...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ITALY):  I do this with an almost heavy heart.  
I say "heavy" because this was not the way we envisioned this would go... what?... 
seven?... eight?... ten?... a score?... four score and seven?... years ago when we started.  
I say “almost” because, unlike us, you may be done with this misery before you 
succumb to old age, and so I must confess I feel as though I’m doing you a favor.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DON): It has "only" been seven...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to MIKE):  Working on it... he’s been away or something.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to WORLD):  Do you realize that, if this game were counted in dog years, 
it'd now be over the age of fifty...?  
Another way of looking at it... I was seven years from retirement age 
when this started and now I’m seven months beyond it... 
Hell, Jim, let’s get on with it before your grandkids start at Brown...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to FRANCE): I'm game for that... let's see who else will draw the time comparisons?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JAMES to JIM-BOB): Since this game started I've changed where I work and have 
had four different jobs there.  
My oldest son has graduated from both high school and college.  
My youngest son has "graduated" from Middle School, Jr. High, High school, and 
completed his freshman year of college.  
I've celebrated both my 20th and 25th wedding anniversaries.  
This game has been going on longer than WWII!  
But hey, if you think it still has life, then I'm on board to see it through.  
However, if you could hold off 1908 for another 5 years I'll be retired and could 
put more thought into the game...

playing for Buddy as Eric is playing for Terry. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Here we go again, and there is real cooperation still going on!
I'll keep this chunking along now.
Thanks to Doug for playing this out to conclusion, not only are his
strings cut, but his survival has run out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) With three survivors left, a DIAS FGR and a GR draw are both proposed.
Please vote with your Winter orders, as always no vote is a veto.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY –- GERMANY): You seem to have forgotten I was a puppet by choice. 
Now that you’re trying to cut my strings, I’m going to let someone else hold them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I have to go research this back to 2003 to build the SC chart and I want to get this out 
before Memorial Day just to stun the players in the other two games.
I have one Endgame statement from Doug Kent, so let me print that now in hopes in
generates some others.  But hey that was TEN years ago...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>End Game Statement:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
DOUG KENT - ENGLAND:
I think I entered this game as a standby, but I’m not sure.  
Sackiepoo Mchugh and I managed to work together, but Brad Wilson was crushed 
and had no hope of joining the fight.  
I blame Turkey’s win on Don Williams entirely.  
If he had done things differently the results would not even resemble these.  
Sackiepoo and I remain blameless.  
If you can’t see what I mean by going back and looking over the prior seasons, 
you have no business playing Diplomacy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i>
COME TO WORLD DIPCON in PARIS, YOU CAN DO IT!!!
Or go to DixieCon in North Carolina this Memorial Day weekend coming up, get out
and play some Dip!!! 
OR, if you can't make it that far, our very own Matt Sundstrom is hosting a game 
at his place in Glenview. Last I knew, they needed four more players to make it 
happen. Who's interested? The game will start at 11 a.m. See
http://windycityweasels.org/current-games-signup.
In other Chicago area Dip news, Weasel Moot VII is coming up in the Chicago 
suburb of Willowbrook on June 22-23, that's exactly ONE month from now.  
I hear that big time politician Edi Birsan is going.
You can find more details on the Weasels website at: http://windycityweasels.org/wm7.
How can you stay home???
And there you are, and for those who thought it wouldn't happen (Cough, Doug; Cough, Don)
here we are.</b>
