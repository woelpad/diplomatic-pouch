This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, soon I hope to follow with the writing. 
We take a look at the beginning of that this issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

<b>NEW FEATURE: ROCK AND ROLL BANDS AND MOMENTS THAT MATTER</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Human Switchboard</i>: This feature is going to wander around through some
predictable (to most of you) and less predictable bands.
It may (I hope) generate some dialog and comments from all of you too.
Let me start with the one band I have most longed to see live, but never did.
In one list of songs from the 1980's 
(http://www.rocknycliveandrecorded.com/songs-for-the-hungry-ipod-ten-essential-non-hits-from-the-1980s.html)
that were essential non-hits, they featured one of their songs, 
"(Say No To) Saturday's Girl", that is one of my favorite road songs of theirs.
For those of you who are Lou Reed/Velvet Underground fans, Human Switchboard
came out of that trend, recorded one album, and has a retrospective CD that
adds some other songs
(http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005KVLIC8/).
This is on my top-10 CDs that I regularly play in my car (yes, I know, I'm 
so outdated, seldom using my iTunes, but I don't).  
In addition to the usual hauntingly insistent keyboards from co-lead singer
Myrna Marcarian, "Saturday's Girl" also has Ernie Krivda on sax.  Myrna and 
Ernie going back and forth can wring deep emotion out of any of their songs.
I'm sure this was a live band that brought you to 2 A.M. with a thought that
you'd just lived a whole other life.  That's the way the songs still sound to me,
just completely different from all the other stale wave bands of the time.
They could never find the right bass player, which I'm sure kept them from 
being signed and really hitting the big time.  But that didn't matter.
And then the magic of "Refrigerator Door", the slow song that brings it all home.
I assert to you all that the nihilstic magic of this song has no comparator
anywhere, it leaves Lou Reed in the dust.
It's the space, the hesitation, the angst in the line, "I found your sympathy 
stuck inside of my refrigerator door, next to my stove... 
and one thing's for sure, you’re out of heat again" that just makes a magical punk
song.
There are few groups and sets of songs like these that both make your heart soar
and make you want to cry every single time you hear them.
I have real rock and roll moments live in bars that we will revisit in this series,
my great regret is that I know ANY moment with this band would have been one of them.
Bob Pfeifer was the other lead singer, it seemed there always was tension between him and 
Myrna, and she didn't sing as much as she might have.
Bob Pfeifer went on to a producer role at Hollywood Records, the Disney label that 
went on after Pfeifer was fired to make the 
Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus records.  
This was a huge shame since Pfeifer has more chops than any record that label ever made,
before or since.
The raw honesty of this music was the essence of wave/punk of the late 1970's and 
early 1980's, which of course for me was the time when I was hanging out in 
small bars listening to essential bands.

<b>DIPLOMACY WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT IS ONGOING - YOU CAN STILL JOIN!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals should start very soon.
But you still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!

<i>((So, I'm in for this and the brackets are just out.
Please think about joining us.  I think we have 13 signed up so far, 
and that's unlucky.
Locally around here, the big news is that Providence College won the 
Big East Championship, but they still ended up as only an 11 seed in the 
East.
PC has a fun team with only six players playing any significant minutes
and most of the team playing 40 minutes many nights. 
Bryce Cotton is one of those underrated seniors that do well in the 
tournament.
In general, it looks like to me that the Selection Committee had their
minds mostly made up before the tournaments, and didn't let outcomes in
those last games faze them much.
Providence seems like it's playing better than all the 8's and 9's in 
the tournament and should be able to give North Carolina a run for
their first game.  
That whole bracket with Iowa State and North Carolina Central is rather 
tough.  I don't think Iowa State is a lock to get by NC Central either.
Then, Louisville ended up fourth in the Midwest, I think Wichita State,
the number one seed in that bracket is going to have a really tough
time getting out of that draw.
As Rick Desper just mentioned to me, the "one and done" moves by the 
stars really makes the Tournament hard to predict and hard to know
the teams as well as we used to be able to do.
Michigan State is another team playing really well now, but only a four
seed.  I am not a fan of Virginia.
And lastly, Syracuse had an amazingly bad recent run, but those are the
kinds of streaks that can get turned around in the tournament.
They are a three seed in the South, and Kansas doesn't impress me there.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A relatively quiet winter season here... we do repropose the failed EF draw
for the Spring turn.  
As usual, failure to vote vetoes the draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to RUSSIA):  Are you feeling lucky?  Well, are you?  
You may be voting for the draw but somebody ain't.  
The way I see things playing out, you'll lose dots before Austria does.  
Standing by your ally makes sense to you in that circumstance?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS to VIENNA):  Hey, my friend, I didn't call the tune to this dance - you 
were the one who shoved that bayonet firmly into the rib cage of your beloved 
Italian ally.  The rest is details.  
Time to vote for the draw as the days of wine and roses are drawing to an end.  
Even the Hundred Years War –- and sometimes I feel like this game has bested 
that time frame –- eventually had to end.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to PARIS): Well, maybe not 100 years, but only an order of magnitude less
than that.
This game really did start in 2006, and it would be fun if it went to 2016, wouldn't it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
LE DUCK du NORMANDIE to LORD JAMES:  Nice work last time –- thanks 
for the assist into the Adriatic.  And a retreat into Tyrolia as planned 
to shore up the line.  Time for us to stick together, 
what, and put paid to these scoundrels.  We’ve got some fun stuff coming up yet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A TYA to A GRE):  Good luck.  I hope you make it out of here alive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOBISH GMING): After long discussions with Keith Sherwood, I ONLY use TYO for
Tyrolia, but feel free to abbreviate it any way you want, just don't call it TRO...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILLIAMS to BURGESS):  Thanks again for keeping this moving -– much appreciated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DUCK): You're quite welcome, quite frankly, it's Kendo Nagasaki that
is holding my interest up at the moment.

1) I think I do have a call for a unanimous and anonymous vote with 
your Spring orders for skipping a Summer press season if there are
no retreats.  If there are retreats, there will be a separate Summer season,
unless everyone submits orders going ahead.
If my policies on this are unclear, please ask.
If you fail to vote on the "no separate summer" question, it is assumed
to be default to my standard separation, unless everyone submits orders to go ahead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to THE GAME): There are a number of press series going on, 
and for one of them, the one named PoD, I have been asked
to continue to reprise the last episode, in this case Part 9, to lead off this issue, 
this may help people read and follow
it better. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRINCE of DARKNESS, PART 9):
I'd known Ajowan for decades but never seen the look that crossed unbidden 
on his face just then.  As quickly, it vanished.  But I'd seen what I'd seen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Wicked Tinker," he whispered hoarsely.  "I haven't heard that name in a hundred years.
I thought him dead."  A hundred years?  What?  
"Cipolin, are you sure?" he said.  
"That name is old, even if the man using it is not.  It is an adversarial name.  
Or once was.  Where did you hear it?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"In Venice.  There was an unknown presence I noted in Rome as I was 
arranging Italian agreement to attack the Archduke.  
The presence slipped north and I pursued.  I missed him in Venice 
but caught up to several of his associates.  I didn't have a lot of time.  
The canals were convenient.  They didn't know much anyway.  
But what did you say... what's this about a hundred years?  How?  
Tell me what you know."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I will not," Ajowan said abruptly.  "I’ve said more than enough.  
Ignore my outburst.  It was unseemly.  You shall, do you understand?  
But, yes, this changes things.  Go to her, find Lila.  Learn what you can.  
Be careful there and guard yourself, she is more than she appears to be.  
There is evil in this news and at least one cold, dead ghost is shaking its bones.  
I'll set out as well.  We'll meet soon and share our findings.  
If the Wicked Tinker is once more prowling the byways and halls of Europe 
there are those who need to know.  They are always seeking photos of ghosts."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'll leave next week," I said.  There were things I still needed to settle in 
Munich, maybe Tyrolia, too, and I'd need the time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That will be soon enough, I suppose," said Ajowan.  
The dagger glittered like something alive where he'd left it on the table.  
He lifted his goblet and drank the last of his wine, wiped his mouth with his sleeve.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Be wary, Cipolin," he said. "The heads of Europe are not your 
gravest menace if this story is true.  Play the fool with her if you must, 
but do not find yourself playing jester to the clown.  I am away."  
With that he disappeared from the chamber leaving me to show myself to the door.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRINCE of DARKNESS, PART 10):
Somewhere a guitar and bandurria played a song of loss and longing.  
The Portuguese and their fado had nothing on the mournful strains of the Romani's music.  
The doleful tune spoke to me in the light of the many candles and flickering 
shadows of the room I'd been waiting in for the better part of an hour.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once more my travel had been jumbled and confused and had taken too long.  
After attending to some necessary liaisons with a ranking military adjutant 
in Munich and a well-placed clerk in Tyrolia I had boarded the train south 
to Albania.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The war had expanded as planned.  
Iago's true colors bloomed more quickly than even I had expected with his 
bloody stab of Dracula and Trieste fell dramatically to marauding 
Italian regiments from Venice.  
Iago'd done it after all and I had bested the Wicked Tinker.  
My train was boarded twice by suspicious Alpini military police 
while we headed southward through the province.  Papers were checked.  
Some passengers removed.  Forcibly.  
Austria had attempted to follow up its invasion of Galicia by mounting 
an offensive into hapless Rumania.  
It had been repulsed by the strong action of the Tsar's army and naval forces, 
themselves eager to claim the country.  
Tiny Rumania remained, for the moment, free of foreign troops 
but the Rumanians were not rejoicing; 
they knew the respite from occupation would be brief.  
Moriarty had claimed the Black Sea but I couldn't discern if this was 
with Sauron's agreement or not.  
Either way, I knew, future surprises were likely in the offing.  
Seizing the advantage of a distracted Austrian command, the Sultan had occupied 
Greece, overwhelmed the defenders of that peninsula 
and claimed a hallowed victory for Ottoman forces.  
Only Serbia remained untouched by the bloodshed.  That wouldn't last another six months.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
HAL had continued his fool's errand, sending French battleships 
from the Channel into the teeth of Voldemort's North Sea fleet 
where they'd fought a blustery but fruitless naval engagement off the coast of London.
Voldemort had also stormed ashore in Norway, toppling that country's 
independence in scant weeks.  Iberia, at least, had fallen to HAL.  
The stories of French atrocities there were chilling.  
It was Palpatine, though, who'd had the most appalling year -– German 
forces had successfully collapsed Denmark in the spring, 
and then with rapacious speed occupied Holland and Belgium, 
doubling the size of her base economy.  
Palpatine and Sauron had apparently worked a silent deal on 
Sweden's fate as Sauron's northern fleet had occupied that country with impunity.  
Winter would hear dark rumbles from Germany as Palpatine's war machine 
went into full production and doubled in size.  
I hadn't heard Minister Zander's take on the European war 
but suspected his face was a mask of smiles as violence erupted from 
Sweden to Spain, England to Turkey.  Things were good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SUN-TZU to MICKOLO MOUSEIAVELLI):  Everybody knows that.  
Next you'll be telling us to act like a fox when it's time to be a fox, 
and a lion when it's time to be a lion.  Whatever that means.  
Look, I said all this centuries before you did -– you just got better 
press because you're a westerner.  Try telling us something really special.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DEATH PANELS to AYN RAND-PAUL):  Speaking of `death panels', we'd like to 
get our hands on you.  When can we make an appointment with your dea... destiny?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SPLUTTERS): I'm not letting these people into this szine, next you'll
be asking me to bring back Eric Klien!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CLUELESS PLAYERS to SPLUTTERING BOOB):  Your nonsensical utterings are off to a 
fast and inane start.  "Antarctic missions to the soul of Shakespeare."  
Huh?  Make sense, lad, make sense!  Oh, and "Spluttering Boob" is redundant, 
another black mark in your column.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SPLUTTERS to the CLUELESS PLAYERS): That's why you remain so clueless!!!
I also know how to make waffles, I think we need to group all the
wafflers next...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE):  You're not doing it right.  Germany got three.  
How can I invade him when he got three?  Stick to the plan, man.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to RUSSIA):  Who are you really?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): I got the plan, Stan!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DENMARK, BELGIUM &amp; HOLLAND to RUSSIA &amp; FRANCE):  
Hurry up and figure it out -– we hate sauerkraut.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to  DENMARK, BELGIUM &amp; HOLLAND):  Perhaps you'd prefer boot leather?  
It can be arranged.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRENCH TOAST to BELGIUM WAFFLES):  That, um, that looks painful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WAFFLERS to TOASTIES):  You don't know the half of it.  
And you should see how he treats us when the kids aren't around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY to GM):  I don't even want to imagine what you were doing while you 
were `waffling', but I hope you washed your hands thoroughly after you were done.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON &amp; DOUGIE to DOUGIE &amp; DON):  Now is the time for all good men 
to come to the aid of the -– oh, to hell with it!  Let's get him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WAFFLERS RETURN): My waffle maker can keep up and send more messages than you can!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BRAD to GM):  You mean this isn't Gunboat?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BRAD): No, it is not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to BOOB):  You're scared at the thought of Double-Ds?  
That's funny coming from someone with the nickname `Boob'.  
What size Boob are you, then?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): I'm scared of nuthin', I'm just shootin' off with my waffles!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to CRUEL WORLD):  I sit on the floor and pick my nose and think of dirty things, 
of devious Wops who stab their friends, and Turks who drub their dings, 
and silver-tongued Tsars who speak the truth in riddles wrapped in rings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA):  Anschluss?  Why, no, I’ve never heard of it.  
Why do you ask?  Please go away, I’m busy building the biggest war machine in Europe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GERMANY): I could take your builds back, be careful how you speak on the
grave of the Anschluss...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to FRANCE):  Keep it up, Pastry-Face, and I'll show you how to make 
crepes with a bayonet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WAFFLERS UNITE AGAINST THE INFERIOR PASTRY PRODUCTS): We shall have no crepes here,
stab the French and cover them with syrup!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  Enjoy Sweden.  They're really just Russians with 
better PR and lighter hair color.  Remember, now, you're playing an eastern game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-TURKEY):  I trusted you for 1 season.   
I was rewarded for my trust with a Turkish fleet in the Black Sea.  
Thanks!  I don't forget my friends or slime like you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND):  I like the strong, silent type.  They attract me like no other.  
Sort of like a `fatal attraction', if catch my drift.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE-TURKEY):  Our plan is working perfectly!  Good job getting Italy 
to agree to help you against Russia, after Russia is finished I'll help you take down Italy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB REPORTS to GERMANY):  I wonder if Glenn Close has double-Ds.  
That would be really really scary.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SPLUTTERS <b>AND</b> WAFFLES): I have had quite enough of all of you!!!
I'm not scared and I'm not worried, and I'm not silent!!! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BUNNY BOILER to BOOB):  I also have a very sharp knife.  
Bet I'd be a great Diplomacy player.  I won’t be ignored, Boob...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BUNNY BOILER): I am not ignoring any of you, except perhaps for the Wicked Tinker,
him I'm afraid of.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SHARON STONE to BUNNY BOILER):  Stow it, Close.  I have a vicious ice pick.  
Who do you think men fear more, me or you?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MS. STONE): We fear neither of you, none of you hold a candle to the 
Gypsy Wife. 
She has some assets neither of you possess.
We're about to find out how and why, at least a little bit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MEN to STONE/CLOSE):  You both make our wienies shrivel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to STONE &amp; BOILER):  Which of you is playing Italy?  I gotta know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(POPE RUTTALOTTA to AUSTRIA):  I hacked you fair and square.  Be good.  
This won't take long.  You know, kind of a badda-bing thing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to CRUEL WORLD II):  Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right.  
No wait.  Clown and jokers wouldn't be so fracking painful.  
I got serial killers to the left of me, psychopaths to right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STONE &amp; BOILER to BOOB):  Is he talking about us?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to STONE/BOILER): Depends on where the clowns are putting their parts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ANDERSON COOPER to HANNITY):  We're just glad he's on your side.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HANNITY to BOOB):  You don't need orders from me.  
I'm always going to attack from right to left.  Right to left.  Right to left.  
There is no other way.  Germany is warned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LINUS to LUCY):  Who is this Shakespeare guy and why is he dragging us into it?  
We haven't been in a good strip since the old man died.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BAD COMIC STRIPS to DOONESBURY): I am Garfield, and I was President!
What are you doing going back to the beginning and reminding us how lame you once were?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BLACK PRESSER to GAME):  Just remember that no matter how much is written 
that is attributed to Russia or Bob Slossar, he is never, ever going 
to be the true author of it.  `Cause Bob don't do press!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BLACK PRESS): Yes, everyone is out there, one might be surprised to know
who is writing what!  I'll never tell, and maybe even this is not me, 
The Boob needs to reserve no bylines to himself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(COLONEL KILGORE to BLACK PRESSER):  Watch your ass there, Presser.  
That was suspiciously close to "Charlie don’t surf"!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to KILGORE):  Oh, I'm such a big fan!  
Can you give us another quote, just for old time's sake?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(COLONEL KILGORE to BOOB):  Well, son, I'll give it a try.  
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Smells like a six center Germany.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to KILGORE):  That's not how I remember it, but thanks for playing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TROUT to BOOB): Me neither, I think the Colonel is just buggy, 
I think we need the Founder of THIS Feast...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TERRY TALLMAN to DUCK):  You know, Ducky, that if I'd known then how 
long Boob would continue to spout drivel I never would have given him his start.  
I have committed grave crimes against humanity, 
sins against logic and good taste, atrocities against the written word.  
I have much to answer for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(NOSEWEEGIE to BOOB):  You can stop at any time.  And put your pants back on.  
That's disgusting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TOADFATHER): From the day you asked me out, you've NEVER been able to 
get me to put my clothes back on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HAIKU-ER to ODE):  Well done!  A proto-epitaph in 17 syllables.  
You're showing talent there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ODE to BOOB):    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Sense And Senselessness

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 What Separates Me From You

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 With All Known Readers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ODIE): Arf, arf to you too...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to ODE):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Screw You Very Much

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The Blade In My Open Back

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Made In Italy

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to ODE-MASTER):  Clever, Poetry Boy.  
But can you man up and write us a full 14 line sonnet?  Well, can you?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to HEATH MAN): You better write us some poetry yourself, you can 
run rings around me!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRINCE of DARKNESS, PART 11):
Tirana was a hotbed of rumor and intrigue with the 
recent military comings and goings and it was a week before 
I could hire a coach to take me to Korce not far from the Greek border.  
Korce was a city of the 5th century -– ancient and antiquated.  
Isolated on a plateau at the foot of the Morava Mountains it had 
never prospered and had little to commend it as far as I could see.  
But it was removed from Europe's main flow of affairs, a decided benefit 
to those who wished their activities to remain hidden in the backwaters.  
The town curled around itself in the old cathedral center where successive 
waves of buildings and structures over the centuries had created a 
quixotic warren of hundreds of interconnected dwellings, shelters, shops, 
and dens for human activity of all kinds.  Connected but impenetrable.  
An apt metaphor for the woman who made that warren her home.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to PRINCE OF DARKNESS): What the hell do we care about Korce, Albania?
No one cares about Albania in this game.
Let's try to talk about something else, anyone for great literature?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILLIAMS to GM):  More reflections on favorite movies and books.  
Recently watched "Inherit the Wind", another old favorite.  
And I know you won't believe this coming from me, but I finally read 
"To Kill a Mockingbird" for the first time only last year.  Wow.  
Great story.  I must have a secret thing for Gregory Peck.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM to WILLIAMS): Really, wow, I loved the book and the movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to DOUG):  Now comes the truthing of all truthings, mein Kaiser.  
To the battlements!  To the battlements!  To the... oh, you get it, 
come on and show your colors already.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ITALY to AUSTRIA:         

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "S" is for the way I stabbed you blind,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "T" is for the treachery in my mind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "A" is very very extra arbitrary

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "B" is betrayed more than anyone one I’ve stabbed before

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 This "stab" was made for you by me!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DOUG to NKC):  It’s a good thing you aren't around to see this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to KBC): Nor you...  watch it, it's about to get even lamer.
You should be turning in your blessed grave.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOLMES to WATSON):  We're off to Turkey, my dear Doctor Watson.  
Moriarty has surfaced, our most treacherous and gravest foe!  &nbsp;The game is afoot, Watson, the game is afoot!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DRACULA to IAGO):  Used a wooden stake for that stab, didn't you?  
The legend never made it clear you could stab me in the heart from behind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IAGO to DRACULA):  Open interpretation is a specialty of mine, dear Count.  
Here, have a nice bracing of garlic while I open the curtain and 
let some sunlight into this nasty dark room.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRINCE of DARKNESS, PART 12):
The Gypsy Wife was not Albanian but had adopted the country years ago.  
Her pronounced accent was a jumble of tongues that hinted of many influences 
and, as such, was uniquely unplaceable.  Maybe she had originally come from Bohemia, 
or maybe Sardinia or Cypress, perhaps from the Basque country or Armenia.  
She alluded to them all in her history.  It didn't matter to her, 
she said, as her people had not been accepted anywhere in Europe 
for more than ten centuries.  All lands were inhospitable to those 
who didn't belong.  The music in the other room spoke of that 
loneliness and alienation.  Albania, with its own tradition of not 
belonging, was not welcoming to the gypsies she said, only less 
hostile than the rest of Europe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometime in the past she had become owner of The Threshing Floor.  
The Threshing Floor was a hard-bitten tavern favored by the local 
criminal element, assorted dark figures, and few others.  
The tavern was now enmeshed in the mass of mean buildings that were Korce, 
but centuries ago had stood alone near the old city walls before the 
town had moodily crowded in around it.  
It was dark even by tavern standards and larger than any of its competitors.  
Generations ago it had been a barn, or a granary maybe.  
One story had it the Gypsy Wife had won The Floor in a duel with knives.  
Another rumor was that she'd terrified the previous owner with baleful 
readings from her tarot deck.  
A third was that it had always been in gypsy hands and she was only the 
current keeper.  It didn't matter.  
Nothing in The Threshing Floor happened without her knowledge and forbearance.  
Most patrons came to the tavern for drink and gossip, both of which flowed 
freely.  Cards, dice, and other games of chance were also a draw.  
Others came to conduct quiet business of a less than legal nature.  
I was here for none of these.  I'd come for information.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd met Lila by chance in Constantinople years ago at the top of the 
Galatian Tower in the eastern part of the city.  
We were both pursuing a Fourth Worlder known as the Al'Harradan baq-El, 
a brutal killer and blackmailer from Syria.  My client had been the 
wealthy family of one of his victims, hers a Romani chief in eastern Turkey.  
I'd needed him alive and had chased him to the Tower after an extended search 
through the Levant.  Her client wasn't as picky and she'd 
accomplished her mission when Al'Harridan baq-El met his end at her 
hands with a fall from the top of the Tower.  Defenestration.  
Messy.  Effective.  After some tense negotiation she’d allowed me to 
take the body to my clients after proving to the gypsy lord he'd 
been neutralized.  It was an uncomfortable accommodation.  
We'd both benefited.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

2) Now things get interesting going up to the First Sprint Line!

Happy St. Patrick's Day (and also St. Joseph's Day, which is big around here).

<br />But what I really want to plug, even though I am not going to make it, is
World DipCon at DixieCon. You can find the details at
http://www.dixiecon.com/id3.html.
Memorial Day weekend doesn't work for me.
This is especially unfortunate since one of my favorite players, Toby Harris,
definitely is coming. 
The international confirmed attendance list includes:  from Australia, 
Andrew Goff and Stephen Lytton; from Holland, Rene Van Rooijan; 
from France, Laurent Joly; from the UK, Dave Simpson and Toby Harris; 
and from Canada, Bill LaFosse.
But Dan Lester, Gihan Bandaranaike, and Siobhan Nolen also I think 
are coming from far, far away.
Some of the details include:

<br />David Hood says: "Dixiecon has been around for a very long time, as Diplomacy tournaments go. 
What the event is primarily known for is the unlimited style of play. 
Whereas most tournaments by design or necessity end Diplomacy games 
after a certain number of hours or game-years, at Dixiecon the games 
end only when someone wins or every player left on the table votes to 
end the game in concession or win. The game is, therefore, focused on 
control of the stalemate line rather than arbitrary totals of centers 
at a certain point in an interrupted game. The Sunday round is a timed 
round, however, since we all have to go home sometime!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />DixieCon is well known for long games and hard fought play.  I think that will
play well for Worlds this year too.
There is the downside that you're playing so much Dip and you're so tired
that you don't have time to socialize as much as you might like.
But I don't think anyone will be seriously complaining about that.
And as Toby says, we Americans are sure to hand the championship to
one of those foreigners.  
Dan Lester is the smart money bet, but Toby is a better bet to me.
Anyway, think about going to this really seriously if you're even thinking
about it a little bit.
I'll be wishing I was there.
