<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

I include the ManorCon announcement (my favorite European Dip Event) as Mark
Stretch requested.
It is in a new location from when I last attended, but from all accounts last
year was great despite poor weather, it should be better this year!!!
At the time of ManorCon, this year as usual on the last weekend in July, 
I plan to be at North American DipCon 
in Bangor, Maine, we hope details on that will be forthcoming shortly.
I think Doug Kent might get some more details for <i>Diplomacy World</i> #101.
DipCon is supposed to be starting on the Thursday night and going through Sunday.
I was going to get this out a few days earlier, but with "April 15th" coming up
I had already intended to take the deadline out an extra week, so we were all set.
I've got a host of subszines in here, and I think I'm back on track now.
Also, think about writing press for games, whether you're in them or not.
Let's show people what postal szines are SUPPOSED to be.
Thanks for the born-again press writers, you know who you are, we love you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal port/DipPouch/Postal

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back at least sometimes.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games
and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York and Doug Kent have been my most frequent subszine guests lately!!!
Andy has been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And Doug Kent has been coming out faster than <i>TAP</i> lately, so
many issues have been having multiple <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s. 
And Michael Lowrey gets his in every few issues too!
So, we have a full set of subszines at the moment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MICHEL FERON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jerry Jones gets added to the list of failures, next up the former
editor of <i>Moeshoeshoe</i>, along with Michel Liesnard one of the 
founders of the Belgian Diplomacy hobby.
If you read the forthcoming <i>Diplomacy World</i> #101 you will 
quickly figure out why I chose Michel Feron to search for next.
There are a host of clues on the Internet that I found, so he 
could be very easy to find. 
Go for it, you have until Issue #320.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am running out of people on MY list of who to search for, so
I am looking for ideas, who would you like to find?
Send me some names.
I may go into Jim Meinel's Encyclopedia of North American Diplomacy
szines and find some more szine editors to search for, that's
what I usually do, but I'd like to find people that some of you
will search for or want to find!!!
Come on, help me out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jerry, Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jerry Jones or Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no
ISE.
If anyone still needs assistance with this, though, since I'm helping

was in charge of the hobby back in the Hoosier Archives days, Eric Ozog augmenting
the oft-heard, but never get enough of, love story between Eric and Cathy,

We were running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but might next issue.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: 
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.  
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.

Jim, I'm glad you liked the Parlor Cats CD.  Almost all of the Brian
Swan guitar work you enjoyed is performed on a big-bodied Gretsch with a
whammy bar.  Most of the more obvious note-bending is done with the
whammy bar, but there's some slide on a few songs.  I didn't know you
had live Eddie Vinson in your background.  What other old-time bluesmen
have you heard in person?  I guess the closest I come are Carey Bell and
Muddy Waters' son, but those were at an outdoor festival, which feels
different than hearing the same music in a little bar.

<i>((Sure, I spent a LOT of time in blues bars in the 1980's.
Cleanhead Eddie Vinson was only one of many.
I saw some of the "popular" blues guys like Robert Cray, but saw
and enjoyed Gatemouth Brown the most. 
Gatemouth was loads of fun and even when he was completely stoned
he was fun to talk to wandering through the crowd.
The big locals at the time were Duke Robillard, Ken Lyon, and
Roomful of Blues.
There also were lots of solo blues artists I used to see all the
time back then, but I can't even remember some of their names now.
They were local guys from the generation older than Duke Robillard
and his crowd.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <b>Rick Desper (Sunday, March 20, 2008 11:03:53 PM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Did these quickly the other day, and gave them a re-look today and only 
made one major change.  I had originally knocked Carolina out in the Elite Eight,
but on reflection, I'm giving them a pass to the Final Four.
<i>((I really thought Tennessee would beat Louisville and then North Carolina,
but UNC might go ahead and just win it all, they would be my choice if UCLA 
falters.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A lot of my picks are according to seed, so I'll only mention digressions and
interesting games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
East:
Apparently 10 seed S. Alabama gets to play their sub-regional in Alabama.  
I'll give them a first-round upset over Butler, but Tennessee will be too much for
them.  They'll be joined in the Sweet Sixteen by Louisville, Notre Dame, and UNC.   
My initial pick was for Tennessee to make the championship game, but I've 
soured on them and now have Louisville in the upset.  
UNC going to the Final Four.
<i>((I should have rethought this like you did, Butler had a good team.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Midwest:
I watched Clemson look dismal for most of the game against Maryland and then,
inexplicably, Maryland collapsed and let them come back from 20 points down.  
(Probably not a good idea to mention this around Andy Marshall.)  
So I have Villanova beating them in the first round, and then, for good measure, 
they take out Vanderbilt to make the Sweet Sixteen along with Kansas, Wisconsin 
and Georgetown.
I have a minor upset in the first round with K-State over USC, 
but that's just to set up a K-State/Wisconsin match-up for my brother.  
He got his Ph.D. from Wisconsin and works at K-State these days.
<i>((Still, you  did nail that one, K-State didn't give Wisconsin
a real battle though.))</i>
In the regional final, the safe thing to do would be to take Kansas over 
Georgetown, but in close games I'll be a homer and take the 
Hoyas in a minor upset to make the Final Four.
<i>((Just what I had predicted.... go Davidson...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
South:
I'm really boring in this bracket.  I don't pick a single upset before the 
Regional Finals, where I take Texas over Memphis.  
My bias in favor of large conference play is playing a role here.
<i>((You nearly nailed that precisely, except for Michigan State's 
upset of Pitt, who left it all on the floor of the BEast Championship game.
And of course Texas didn't even come close against Memphis.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West:
I take A&amp;M over BYU in the 8-9 game, but either team is fodder for UCLA.  
UConn will make it back to the Sweet Sixteen, and if they play 
at their best they can give UCLA a game, but that should be about it for them.  
On the other side of the bracket, 
I have West Virginia taking out Duke in the second round, only to lose to Xavier.  
<i>((Good picks!!!))</i>
Picking Duke to lose early is one of my favorite habits, and oddly, 
it has worked out well for me in recent years.  
The safe thing would be to pick Duke to at least make the Sweet Sixteen.  
In any case, I think UCLA is much
better than any of the other teams in this regional, and they should cruise 
to the Final Four.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Final Four:
At this point, I'll notice that the games are being played in Texas, and not a
neutral site.  On a neutral site, I would have UCLA winning.  Since it's in 
Texas, I've got the Longhorns winning.  And I pick Georgetown over UNC 
in the other semi, going again with the conscious bias to pick 
Georgetown in what should be a close game.  Oh, and Texas wins the championship.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm a bit concerned that I'm going too far with Georgetown.  But they really 
are a good team as long as they keep Hibbert out of stupid foul trouble like they
had against Pitt in the Big East Championship.  And in a weird twist, they 
actually have shooters that can shoot from outside.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of the teams I knock out before the Final Four, Kansas is the most dangerous,
and certainly could win it all.  I'm a bit down on the Tennessee teams (Memphis,
the Vols, and, FWIW, Vandy) since I think the SEC is weak this year and C-USA 
is weak every year.  I think Memphis <i>could</i> make the Final Four over Texas, but
don't really feel the same about Tennessee.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are a lot of teams that <i>could</i> win it all.  
I think UCLA should be the biggest favorite, even though UNC is #1, 
since UNC doesn't seem very deep to me.
Also, Roy Williams is notorious for losing games in the tourney that he 
shouldn't.  I don't think he's completely shaken that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My other concern is that I'm too negative about Duke.
But I really don't see a complete team there.
Also, aside from UNC, there were not a lot of
very good teams in the ACC this season.
The deep conferences are the Big 12 and the Big East.
THe ACC is still basking in the glow from the '90's, but
it's just not that good right now.
Miami was their #4 team: in the Big East, they would not
have been in the top 8.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Texas is <i>not</i> the best team in the country.
Heck, they're not even the best team in the Big 12.

<i>((Yeah, boy we could have said almost the same 
things for most of this.  I thought those BEast teams
were going to do well, but I think (in the end) they
just beat each other up too much.  My
bracket was wiped out by Georgetown and Pitt.
I went for the "Two's plus UCLA", Georgetown, Tennessee,
Texas and UCLA and had Pitt beating Memphis.
Now we COULD have all four #1 seeds go to the finals,
which has NEVER happened.
I did especially poorly this season by missing Davidson,
even though I even watched a game or two from them this year,
just thinking Curry wouldn't be THAT good, and didn't get
ANY of the Sweet Sixteen upsets (very poor year for me on
that).  
I got Davidson for their first round upset, along with Siena,
Villanova, Arkansas, and Texas A&amp;M, but that's really a 
pretty pathetic record.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, I was really quite upset with Georgetown since they had a classic choke 
against Davidson.  After proving they could run up a huge lead, they just stopped
playing either offense or defense.  Guys were standing around with confused 
looks on their faces.  
They didn't use their advantage in the low post and Hibbert repeatedly 
drew stupid fouls.  Hibbert is maddening because he does this all the time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can still win the PTKS pool if Texas wins it all, but since I had Georgetown 
going to the championship game I'm likely screwed.

My Orange are in the NIT.  A lot of folks in Orange Nation are upset that
Kentucky got in the NCAAs while we are back in the NIT for a second straight
year (the sun did come up Monday morning, but we were very concerned).  I
agree that Kentucky didn't deserve to make the field, but I don't think that
Syracuse deserved it either.  We are playing for next year when we will have
more than 7 available players.  Look for SU to be a top 10 team next year.
I see that PC has fired Welsh.

Yes, PC did fire Tim Welsh, I was not in favor of this move, but

I now worry that they aren't cranking it up and getting the coach
that they need, since if they were going to disrupt everything it 
seems to me that they should get someone good.
Welsh leaves them loaded in relative PC terms, PC should be solidly

rolling slowly down the line and see whose 3rd baseman can come up with
it.
<i>((The popular curse to be discussing is the one that reaches its

Hopefully the Red Sox fans out there that wanted to could catch the
game...er...today.  
<i>((It was sorta fun to watch the game over breakfast and listen to it
driving in rather than driving home, like I usually do.))</i>
Those of us that cheer mostly for the Cubs will have
to wait until the 31st to get our opening day, and until around 2040 to
hoist a WS banner.  Nevertheless, here are the fearless predictions from
the almost-no-longer-snowed-in heartland...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
American League:  It looks a lot more cut-and-dried here in terms of who
challenges for playoff spots this year.  I see 6 teams challenging for
the 4 spots:  EE1, EE2, EE3 and Detroit, Cleveland and Seattle.  Toronto
is one Scott Rolen injury away from being under .500.  The Twins, A's
and Rangers are rebuilding.  The White Sox are probably better than a
lot of people think, but that only gets them to .500.  Tampa Bay is
improved enough to get to 70 wins and challenge Baltimore for 4th in the
AL East, and Kansas City is still Kansas City.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West:  A quandary here.  The Angles are so beat up in the pitching staff
that even their money may not get them enough replacements and depth to
out-do the M's.  It's a lack of supply, not a lack of resources.  I'll
take Mariners, Angles, Rangers and A's.  Seattle gets to 89 wins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Central:  A second quandary here.  Does Detroit have enough pitching to
go with their monstrous hitting?  I think that some of their young arms
come back from last year, but counting on Willis is not going to pan
out.  I'll go with Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Minnesota, and
what's-their-names.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
East:  More monstrous hitting, more questions in the pitching.  Can the
Red Sox get enough healthy arms to last the season?  See Angles above.
Can the Yankees recover in their starting rotation?  More questions than
answers.  I'll take New York, Boston, Toronto, Baltimore, Tampa Bay.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WC:  It comes down to Detroit and Boston.  I'll pick the Red Sox,
although there will be an investigation led by former Sen. Mitchell into
whether there was a conspiracy by ESPN to let them win it.  No one will
report on the possible conflict-of-interest.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
National League:  Considerably cloudier than the AL.  Any time I think
of the Mets a loud voice screams in my head: "Paper Tiger!!!".  I think
the Twins knew something dealing Santana.  I want to believe in them,
but I've never seen Omar Minaya and Gregory Potemkin pictured together.
I think the Phillies are down, the Rockies won't roll 7's all September,
and the Brewers have no depth or money to get it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West:  A 4-team battle, and maybe even 5 with the Giants no longer
carrying Bonds' posse on the payroll.  More pitching than hitting in
this division, so who does it best?  I'll go with Arizona, San Diego,
Los Angeles, Colorado and San Francisco.  The Rockies are only 10 out at
the end of the season in the most competitive division.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Central:  The Cubs are spending their way up to EE status.  Not that it
will be easy for them, or that they'll be a lot over .500, but I think
they get the division.  Call it Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Houston,
Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh.  Cubs go 88-74.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
East:  By contrast, this division seems back to normal, or at least back
to looking like it did 10 years ago.  Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia,
Florida, Washington.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WC:  Somehow the Mets find a way to choke, this time with 2 games left,
and San Diego gets the Wild Card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Indians over Red Sox; Yankees over Mariners.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Indians over Yankees.  Note that Cleveland fans would celebrate
this more than a revenge ALCS win against Boston.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  Braves over Padres; Diamondbacks over Cubs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Braves over Diamondbacks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Politically Incorrect WS:  Indians over Braves.

<i>((I was going to comment through yours, but decided to keep it
separate so everyone can see......))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League East: I think the Yankees have the greater number
of questions and Tampa Bay really could finish third.  I'll predict
it Boston, New York, Toronto, Tampa Bay, and Baltimore, but remember
that Tampa Bay is my "sleeper pick.
The Red Sox will be better because guys like J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Drew and Julio Lugo
are going to be much better offensively this year and Bartolo Colon
is going to be NEEDED and turn out to be a steal.
The Yankees will have a mess getting a bunch of old guys playing time
when they're all healthy and then have holes when their injuries 
coincide.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League Central: Everyone always forgets the "don't predict
this season off last season", each one is different.
That's going to be the Indians' problem this year, just as it was
Detroit's last year.
Detroit wins it this time going away, Chicago and Cleveland battle for
second, but with no Wild Card chances.
The Twins go straight to the bottom and the Royals, YES, the Royals, are
the surprise team.
Brian Bannister will be better and Gil Meche is good.
Greinke and Bale are better than most teams have in 3/4 slots.
And Mark Teahen and Billy Butler will hit more than everyone expected.
That's the "out on the limb" prediction this year.
Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, KC, Minnesota.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((American League West: I don't see why people think Oakland is going to be
THAT bad, I think they will be better than everyone expects, my sleeper
pick for this division.
Of course, that won't get them in the playoffs either, just like KC,
but they won't fall out by the All Star Break.
Texas is the TRULY bad team here, Kason Gabbard who Boston jettisoned
will end up being their top starter after the other injuries, if he
isn't injured again himself.
Angels, Seattle, Oakland, Texas.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The wild card will be between Seattle and New York, possibly with Chicago
as a surprise, but won't matter, the Red Sox blow out everyone in the playoffs
to go back to the World Series.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League East: Goz beat me to it.
I think Atlanta will win this easier than most others believe.
The predictions I see show the Mets, Braves and Phillies really,
really close.
This REALLY means that Atlanta runs away with it as the Mets and
Phillies are each deeply flawed, so they are my sleeper, if a team
with as much payroll and history as them can sleep through anything.
Flip a coin at the bottom.
Washington needs Shawn Hill to get healthy, but I think he will.
Atlanta, Philly, New York, Washington, Florida.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League Central: There are just TOO many teams in this division,
how can Pittsburgh get over .500 when they have so many teams to compete
against???
They won't do it again this year.
The Cardinals are also a disaster, but won't be as bad as Pittsburgh.
Any of the other four COULD win it, especially given this division's 
history.
Sleeper to win it, Cincinnati, really!
Like Boston picked up Bartolo Colon, Cinci stole Josh Fogg, he'll be solid,
and they have Francisco Cordero for the bullpen.
I love Scott Hatteberg as a super sub and pinch hitter, and Griffey Junior
will have a great season, I'll bet.
I'm not alone in this one, but also Edwin Encarnacion is likely to break out.
Sorry, Goz, the Cubs can make the playoffs as the Wild Card, but they
won't take the division.
Don't they have a new Japanese player, if he turns into Ichiro, maybe.
But otherwise, they are short.
Cincinnati, Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((National League West: I like Barry Bonds.  Really.
Someone should pick him up and I think someone will.
And he will be a positive offensive force.
You all think I'm insane, I don't care.
I've said enough, always happy to recount the issues.
The rules are the rules, and you have to judge each
era on what was done.
Just as Steroids were once claimed to be irrelevant in baseball
(remember that??), they now are claimed to be the ONLY reason why
people succeeded or failed.  Both views are 100% wrong, of course,
and you ALL know that if you really think about it.  
The "one reason" issue that our human brains seem to triangulate
in on to answer any question remains the most fascinating human
behavior to me.
Anyway, the only prediction, sorry as I am to make it as Giants
fan, I am sure about is that the Giants will finish last.
OK, so who is my "sleeper", I've seen some people predict the
Dodgers will win, so it's not that much of a sleeper, but Arizona and
Colorado were the big winners last year, so LA it is.
I am NOT a Dodger fan, and I'm not a Joe Torre fan, but he IS the
right manager for this team.
Flip a coin for the rest, LA, Colorado, Arizona, San Diego, and SF.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The West beats itself up and the Wild Card does not come from there.
I think it will be Chicago, but could be Philly.
Can the Cubs win it all?
Tempting, they will win their first round game against LA.
Atlanta will beat Cincinnati.
I know how Goz loves Cubs/Atlanta games.
Atlanta goes to the World Series and loses to the Red Sox.
Another sweep.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Lastly, I feel I need to say something about the other basketball
issue going on.
I finally made the leap from rabbit ears and no cable all the way to
Verizon FIOS, this is a switch I've heard that lots of us Luddites
have been doing.
This is being driven, if you live in a cave, that our new digital 
broadcast TV system was going to cause people like me problems.
We get lots of stations with fuzz and snow.
Fuzz and snow in the digital world would have been unwatchable.
Anyway, I like sports on the radio, which is why I like basketball,
hockey and baseball, but not football.
Football is pretty worthless on radio.
But I like watching the Celtics on TV and I couldn't before.
All of you probably are aware of the historic turn-around, soon
the Celtics will set the record as they win about 35 games 
more than they did a year ago.
You're aware of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen.
What you are likely not aware of is what a TEAM they have.
Celtics fans have been wondering for years why Rick Pitino
drafted Chauncey Billups and then gave up on him before he
became a top-five in the NBA point guard.
Rick convinced ME that he would be that at the time.
Ever since the Celtics have struggled at point guard.
But Rajon Rondo is the real thing, and eventually he is 
going to be better than Billups.
Maybe as soon as the playoffs this year.
The Celtics are amazingly fun to watch, even if you think
NBA basketball is boring.
You heard it here first if you're not from around here.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The proposal for an RA two way draw fails, we play on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Well, that didn't work so well.  As Jeff O'Donnell had to leave
and I had to pull in multiple standbys, I had this E-Mail from this
guy Heath Gordon who wanted to join, we exchanged a whole series of 
E-Mails, but then..... he's gone.
Back to the first name on my standby list, I'm calling on Mike.
Heath has until the SUMMER deadline to get me draft Fall orders
if he actually wants to do this, otherwise Mike Barno will take
over.
Mike at present is having a problem with his Lightlink E-Mail account,
but he expects to have it corrected by the Summer deadline, so he
should be good to go, and most of you know Mike, I think?
This also will make it a bit of a "New York flavored game 
as three players will be from there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) As a "very last minute note" I heard from Heath (no orders, just 
heard from him) that he is in Germany on vacation.
If you notify me about these things in advance we can do something
about them....
in any case, things still stand that Heath has to get draft Fall orders
to me by the Summer deadline, or I'll have to replace him.
Thanks for understanding, everyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(OLD ENGLAND to NEW RUSSIA): It is hard to work things out without
talking.  Let's get talking!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LONDON to BERLIN): Is the Kaiser still on vacation in Florida?  I hope he
provided orders to the Imperial Army before leaving.  It doesn't look good,
leaving the country in the middle of a war for survival.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE BRITS): We got the orders from the Kaiser just fine.... the
Czar, not so good.
See above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SPEAKS OUT ON CLASSIC PRESS): I know we're seeing some of this in the 
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i> subszine too.
I just want to say how much I'm enjoying this press and want to encourage
everyone in the szine (players and non-players) to get more press.
This is one of the things that distinguishes the "postal" game from
the pure E-Mail game (attempts to add "postal" press to E-Mail games
generally have failed).
What I seem to be seeing in these recent efforts (both here and in <i>ES</i>)
are similarities to press we used to read in Steve Langley's <i>Magus</i>
and the various subszines therein. 
If we could get to that level again, which we probably won't, but I can hope,
it would be truly tremendous.
I've always felt this pathetic effort never had a hope of holding a candle
to <i>Magus</i>.
Lastly, as you read below, you will see why I added these few lines of filler....

Nun too sure of herself</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 She said it solemnly, with weight.  Like it meant something.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I thought Hierophant reversed was Tnahporeih," I said.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You'se a moron," the blonde said.  She punctuated the remark with the tommy gun. 
I'm assuming it was meant to be an exclamation point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Toots, that is the first thing you've said that I understand." 
I took off my fedora and spun it onto the hat rack across the room 
and propped my feet up   It looked like we were gonna be awhile. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So, this case you're working.  Whatcha got," asked the blonde.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The case I got is a case of indigestion," I answered, 
"and not the garden variety.  We're talking a real hobo stew here.  
Nothing adds up, and there seem to be a lot of players."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"At least seven," nodded the blond.  Her full head of hair 
swayed like an ocean wave as her head moved on her curvaceous neck.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Seven. I'd just learned something else.  
At this rate I'd be a genius in twenty issues.  
The trick is not to remember something important in the brain cell 
that you're gonna drink away that night.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I was at the Copa to try and shake something loose," 
I gave her my best half-smile, "looks like it worked."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She hadn't come up with clothes since Chapter 5 so I was 
able to admire the way the blush worked its way over her alabaster skin.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I been working dat joint for weeks, since #307.  
I din't come up with nothing…till you came along.  
And I ain't dat loose," said the naked woman who had let herself into my home…

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hey, a guy can only hope; you were definitely working it. 
Which begs the point, which player are you?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I picked up the pack of Red Kings, 
tapped out two and put them both in my mouth.  
I started to reach into my pocket for my matches, 
but she raised the barrel of the tommy gun and arched an eyebrow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Two fingers."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Good idea," I muttered around the butts, "I'll take a shot myself."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She smiled those pouty lips of hers and took the hint.  
She pulled the cork on the bottle of the Cheater's she'd brought, 
using her pearly whites and poured two stiffs; 
that brought the count up to three all told.  
All the while, she kept the tommy gun barrel unwaveringly pointed 
in my direction.  This kitten could multi-task.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I used two fingers to fish out my matches, 
lit the cigs and then traded her a fag for the boiler.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She raised the shotglass, "Bottoms up."  I could only hope.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"May your allies be true and your enemies be few," I toasted back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Not in this game," she said, and downed the whiskey.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So I figure you don't work for Flat."  
She had the moxie that Flat could use, but he wouldn't 
had her set me up while he thought I was working on his dime.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"No," she smiled, "someone higher up."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Higher up?" I glanced at the header of the page -– <i>Red Kings</i>, 
"you really <b>are</b> the cigarette girl?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Damn, you're thick."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Only in the good places." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm a nun."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had nothing... I looked back at the proceeding line to see if it was a typo.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"A nun?"  See, my reputation for snappy repartee is well deserved.  
I surveyed the situation from the comfort of my chair; 
yep, a naked blonde with a machine gun had the drop on me 
in my own place, she was drinking and smoking... and yep, she was hot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"A nun?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yes, I really am a nun."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That's a bad habit."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well," she parted her lips with her tongue, "bad habits are hard to break."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Can you do that." I asked, waving my cigarette 
vaguely back and forth to indicate... well everything.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Do what?" she cocked her pretty head to one side cascading the 
lustrous blonde hair down over one bare breast.  
Now I wasn't sure how I felt about that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Uh, y'know... flirt, be naked... you know the whole nun with a gun thing.  
I thought you had rules."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm not dat kind of nun," she answered back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Nuns got kinds?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, I'm a sister of the Order Magister.  A church dat's as old as time, 
founded by the followers of Archbale All-Man."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So you don’t have those regular nun type rules..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She shook her head slowly back and forth.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I've got a Murphy bed."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Nice segue, but we're not done.  What did you learn at the Copa?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I gave her my best smart-ass comeback,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That the Hobby doesn’t have a zoo."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, no... at least, not anymore."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Damn!"  I could practically hear the click as the 
lightbulb came on, even the little skittering noise 
the chain makes when you let it go too quick and it bounces around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What is it?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'd bet you dollars to donuts it's a clue."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What’s a clue?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The zoo.  The zoo is a clue."  It was beginning to sound 
like Dr. Seuss again, I couldn't help but think about gnus... in canoes.  
But those weren't clues.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What in the Hobby makes you think that the zoo has anything to do 
with the Tarot, the Diplonomicon, ancient powers, demons or the Hierophant," 
she exclaimed, again punctuating with the tommy gun.  
I hoped that thing had a safety.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It's the elephant," I answered.  She looked at me blankly.  
"Look, the elephant was mentioned in Chapter 4, "A Shot in the Dark."  
And the doorman said the Hobby didn't have a zoo.  
It was mentioned in Chapter 5, "The Lady Ratta-tat-tatted Lace" 
along with the otters.  Now here we are in Chapter 6, 
"Nun Too Sure of Herself" 
(I knew I should have paid more attention to that title when I walked by it!) 
and it turns out that there was, or had been, a zoo in the Hobby.  
That's significant.   
You don’t think they put all this stuff in here as filler and drivel, do you?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yes, I do," answered the blonde.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm telling you, it's a clue."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"People pay you for this?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well, not many people..." I had to admit, 
"you got something against deductive reasoning."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"We're looking for the Hierophant, not the elephant," 
she exasperated, which is cool to watch on a naked woman, 
"they just sound alike.  
That's not deductive reasoning, it's... it's... palindromic reasoning."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Actually a palindrome is a word that is spelled the same 
frontwards and backwards... like moron."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She looked at me quizzically.  
Whatever reply she had was drowned out by the pounding on the door.  
As you know, I know my knocks, and this wasn't Burgess looking for rent, 
or even a potential client.  
This was gun-butt on wood breaking the door in knocking... not my favorite.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She sprayed the door with a sleet of lead from her gat, 
which brought a unique silence to the situation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"They're onto us," she said, "you got a back way outta here?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We moved to the window behind my desk.  
I grabbed my fedora and trench coat off the hat rack as I passed by.  
Pushing up the window I looked down into the alley behind the Abyssinian Prince.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Damn," I cursed, "Burgess hasn't fixed the fire escape.  Chintzy landlord."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The naked nun cast a quick glance out the window, 
still keeping her primary attention on the currently quiet front door.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"We'll have to jump," she surmised.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Babe, we're at the top of the page.  
If we jump from here we’re liable to break something.  
Something we might want to use later." I gave her my best wink and raised eyebrow, but it ricocheted off her worried glance at the front door.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What are we gonna do?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Tell me a story..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What.  Now?"  She looked at me incredulously. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Now's the best time, seeing as how there might not be a later. 
Like why did you become a nun?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It runs in the family..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Your mom was a nun," I asked.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Actually, yes."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Your dad was a nun?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Her response wasn't verbal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm liking your rules more and more," Nuns have kinds, whoda thunk it?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"My family has been in the Order forever.  
We've been seeking the Diplonomicon longer than I've been alive."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was half paying attention to her, keeping one eye on the front door.  
Thought I heard some movement out there.  I was counting on my fingers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What are you counting?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Lines.  We're getting lower.  I figure a few more lines and we can jump."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Can't you just change the font size?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I chuckled.  Amateurs.  I've been around the block.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It doesn't work that way," I replied, 
"ya never know how the publisher's gonna handle it.  
You change the font size and he could change it back when he prints, 
go all Pica on ya'... then splat, you're pizza pie on the patio.  
Here, you're gonna need this."  
I gave her the trench coat to put on, 
apparently we'd formed some sort of ad hoc alliance, 
as her heater was pointed more at the door than at me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So I guess we haven't been properly introduced," I said, "what's your name?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Charlene St. Allman.  My friends call me Charly," she smiled, "what's yours?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Suddenly the front door splintered in on its hinges, 
and three plug uglies piled into the office throwing 
lead like molten mosquitoes in a summer swamp.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Jump," I yelled, and grabbed Charly as I plunged through the window.  
She was a trooper rattling off return fire from the tommy as we went out and down.  
I hit the ground and tried my best to cushion her fall by banging 
my head on the asphalt, and bruising my elbows against the dumpster.  
She was all pillowy softness on top of me... under other circumstances...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I gasped for breath, "keep talking."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What... why," we could see the gunsels charging the open window.  
She was trying to untangle the gat and bring it up.  
I grabbed her head in my hands and brought her lips to mine.  
At first she tried to pull away, then she felt the passion and plunged into it with fervor.  After a few moments we broke apart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Look," she said, "they're back at the top of the page."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yep, it's all about getting to the next page. Let's vamoose."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So it was me and the nun with the gun on the run.  I couldn't wait for Chapter 7.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) So, we had I) GIRF draw, II) GT draw, III) FAIRT draw, IV) Recalling 
Terry Tallman to play Germany.
All were rejected.
New proposals are as follows.
We have I) Concession to Turkey; II) AEIT draw; and III) Expulsion of 
Ozog/Replacement player for Ger (Reason: Tallman is ambulatory and should 
have resumed play much earlier).
Please vote on each of these proposals with the Summer orders, 
failure to vote vetoes them all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Note the slight adjustment in Bernie/Buddy's E-Mail address.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY - TURKEY): Eric tells me you have a tendency to
get really cranky in this game.  I am waiting to see
how true that might be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CONSTANTINOPLE APR 1, 1907): Sultan Hatas I announced the 
cancellation of the projected Berlin - Constantinople Railway. "We 
cannot, alas, support this German scheme. We Ottomans must defend our 
realm unlike the cowardly Germans who scourge all weak nations yet have 
not the courage to oppose the strong."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN): The Kaiser Interim scoffs at the proposal to bring the Kaiser
Emeritus back.
It is merely whining on the part of Austrians and Turks who desire for
the previous alliance structure which was more favorable to themselves
before I took over the reins of der Fatherland.
Heil Germany!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB RETORTS): Shouldn't that be der ToadFatherland?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY - WORLD): If you don't care about this game, how
can you expect anybody else to?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BUDDY): Welcome to Doug Kent as the replacement Italian Player.  
Long live R-G-F-I victory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY - GM): Make sure you and all who read this visit
http://www.helpfulkitty.com for the latest in Toby the
Helpful Kitty news, photos, and merchandise!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ITALY): Hey, why should I help you, I lose enough
money on this hobby too, why don't you let me share.
Oh, then I would have to run ads too.... never mind.

Thanks to Boardman Number Custodian Tom Howell for compiling the statistics.
I think we can read this down below and I think I transcribed everything 
correctly.
Tom sent me it in UNIX format, finally I figured that out.
This is done unless we have any

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) There are no current proposals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Vern Parker has NMRed, so I'm calling Bob Osuch as a standby.  
Bob hasn't played Diplomacy in a bit, and he reports he's been
playing Computer games lately, but he also says he recently was
perusing old <i>Voice of Doom</i>'s, so calling him to this position
(which I didn't know before asking him) seems appropriate.
Vern has to get me draft Fall orders by the Summer deadline to
retain the position, if he doesn't then Bob takes over and 
you'll all know that when you submit Fall orders.  As a warning
to everyone, Bruce Linsey is on vacation traveling much of this
month and will not have access to E-Mail, I don't believe, but
he will be back before Fall orders are due.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that Andy York's E-Mail address has been updated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Alex Woo picks up the first points by winning the first Sprint!!!
Looks like the Three Alamos could follow close behind.... 
but they are trailed by Death....
(hey, I thought it was funny!!!!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Dave replaces Rick as the "low man on the replenishment totem pole".
I carved out some of your comments into press to keep the masses amused....
I'm sure you don't mind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CUT-MY-OWN-THROAT DIBBLER ROLLS): Let's see if I roll snake eyes three times in a row.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DIBBLER): Dave betters your feat for one round, at least.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE FAMOUS FOUR DRAFT): Hope being that I either land near the front to score some 
points this time, or Tom lines up his guys on 32-35 and I draft them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB DABBLES): That would be no, and no....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE TURTLE GUESSES SOME MORE): I expect <i>some</i> riders to break 
for the sprint finish line.  
But the more experienced players like Dave and Tom may hang back.  
In any case, I have no hope for the first sprint, so I'll assume there 
will be a mob in the low 20s.  And hope that somebody is on 23.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB DING-DONG DANGLES): Ding, ding, ding, you hit the jackpot, choosing
correctly that Tom would play Mideast low.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GRANNY): Waves from her broom as she slows down, she hopes somebody tucks in between 
her and Rincewind at 23.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN CARROT OF THE CITY WATCH) Speeds up to have a chat with Granny, whom 
he hasn't seen in a while.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DEATH): Notices that somebody's hourglass is running low on sand, so he dashes forward.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB CONCLUDES): The Alamos had better watch out, their time is nearly up!
