addresses are reported in this format, replace the " of " with "@"; if you 
bounce try sending to me from another account or FAX to (401) 277-9904. 
For Faxing, most of the time you have to call me to tell me it's coming
so I can set up the FAX.  Some of you have been getting bounced messages from
my ISP's spam protection, if that happens to you, USE my backup E-Mail
at jfburgess of gmail.com!!!  Don't complain that my E-Mail keeps bouncing
without forwarding the bounced message to that address.
Then I can forward it to the ISP help to get it dealt with.

<br /><br />Ah well, some interesting things in here, but yes, we're late again.
I hope you're all having a wonderful summer.
It has been a beautiful summer here in New England, so lots of work
and lots of fun has left the szine late.
But I've adjusted the deadlines to compensate, we'll give you all until
the weekend after Labor Day.
Lots of good stuff in here.... including a surprise announced further down
the page.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
http:/evel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine has remained "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date was now a "whenever".
But HERE we are in this issue, Peter is back!!!
See <i>Octopus' Garden 54</i> in the print edition below, or on the web
at the above address.
In particular, Peter has something to say about the very concept of doing what
I'm doing here, printing 130 copies of a szine and sending it out - and 
doing it in a way that pleases me, but doesn't make any money and certainly
doesn't win any style awards.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge have been picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.
Rip has been traveling this summer also, but he is trying to get his act back
together soon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR DEREK NELSON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm going to continue putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, 
working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
Derek Nelson is the person who won the first postal game in
<i>Graustark</i>.
He's been missing for at least 25 years, I know in the records I can
find that he attended the 1976 DipCon in Baltimore.
I think it will be fun if we can find these Golden Agers.
So, let's really find Derek, it's worth fifty bucks!!!
You have until the next issue, #295, at the fifty buck price.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Map Collection, ERC Library, University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.

WorldMasters 2002 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals are over, and 
in a game that went to 1914 (nice idea here to let the finals go
on for longer, a feature of WorldMasters that I applaud) Julio
Pereira gets to 14 centers as Russia and TAKES the 2002 WorldMasters
Tournament.
Congratulations to Julio, and salutes and felicitations to the
growing impact of the Brazilians in the Diplomacy hobby.
Julio is a fierce player and a good guy to boot.
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm02/ for full details.  Since I didn't get sufficient
interest to get a team in for 04, I am back on the WorldMasters Tournament Management
Committee again.  See:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
for details on that, the first round games are now done, but I've not
seen the Round 2 draws yet.
Some notable Round 1 winners include Jerry Fest, Egbert Ferreira,
Thomas Franke, Tim Richardson, Andy Bartalone, Conrad Woodring,
David Partridge, Erlend Janbu, Smacko McMillie, Jack Brawner,
and Glenn Ledder.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
But most of the talk there has been about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson
and Tony Dickinson, among others!).  
This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really
is quite comprehensive.

They ARE going to make it and release it this fall, but there are a 
number of concerns and opportunities that this is going to create.
If anyone is interested, some of us have been in some informal contact
with the game designers, but I really don't have the time to fully
engage them.
You all should read the interview in the Spring 2005 movement issue

Frank's style in viciously stabbing for the wins is unique in my experience
and I've enjoyed the point of his knife to that end.
Tom Kobrin and Edi Birsan make as great a top 3 as we've seen in recent
World DipCons.
Of course, an American CANNOT win a World DipCon in America, as that streak
keeps going.
For those of you that don't know Frank, he's Norwegian and I've been diligently
learning Norwegian so that the next time we're at a table together we can
negotiate across the table in a different language.
We go to Germany for World DipCon next, see the next/latest Diplomacy World

Hi Jim,
Sandy and I wanted to let you know that the latest Kenny has arrived.
Timothy Paul Kenny was born July 26th, at 5:12pm (1712 in military time,
which is what Cooper Hospital uses).  Little Tim, our smallest, weighed in
at only 9 pounds and 3 ounces, and is 22 and 1/2 inches long.  This has been
the smallest of our 5 children.  Since the little guy was a breach baby,
(nothing ever goes smoothly for us), Sandy will be in Cooper Hospital until
Saturday.  She wanted me to send you a note, (and I would have sent you a
note anyhow).
Hope all is well with you.  Thanks for sending us <i>TAP</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob/Rick/Dave,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's been too long since I've set fingers to keyboard and ranted about all 
the ills of baseball.  Since it looks like you haven't put out <i>TAP</i> for 6 
weeks perhaps you were waiting on me.  I apologize.
<i>((Nah, too much of summer, travel, grandchild, and work..... but good to
hear from you!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Shall we see what's up?...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  The Yankees have gone 39-22 since an 11-19 start, and are 
starting to look like the Yankees, despite having four starting pitchers 
who all used to share the rotation with Ruth.  They still look like the 
division winners to me.  Boston needs to turn things around (note:  it 
looks like both teams turn around after they get thumped by Tampa Bay...go 
figure), but they likely will.  Baltimore appears to have run out of 
steam.  Toronto appears to have been a paper tiger based on how well 
they've done since Halliday got injured, and Tampa is still Tampa.
<i>((Since you wrote this, the Yankees went down a bit, after a REALLY
hot streak Jason Giambi just went something like 0 for 25.  
They are still hanging around within hailing distance of Boston, but
I believe the Yankees won't make it down the stretch.
And um, yes, they do have the HIGHEST payroll, right?
Then again, they just got thumped by Tampa Bay and now are on a little roll.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  Being in the Chicago area we see a lot of things with the 
White Sox that those of you on the East Coast don't (since they don't talk 
about anything West of the Appalachians except for Anaheim and Oakland).  I 
think they're doing it with mirrors.  But if they can keep doing it with 
mirrors for the next 3 months they can buy rings.  Their starting pitching 
is great, but they're really pretty ordinary after that.  I keep waiting 
for the balloon to pop, but we're at 90 games and counting.  Minnesota is 
playing like an ok team, but that won't do it.  Cleveland can run hot &amp; 
cold, so if anyone from the Central is going to make a run at the Wild 
Card I'd think it them, but they could just as easily fall to 4th in the 
division.  Detroit shows promise but not much more.  Kansas City is still 
Tampa.
<i>((The chinks seem to be showing in the White Sox armor lately.
And they're the ones the Yankees are beating up on as I write.
The rest of those Central teams have little to no chance of making the
playoffs, so it pretty much is down to the East vs. for the West for
the wildcard.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  The Anaheim Angels of Los Angeles California brought to you by 
Budweiser (hereafter referred to as "Evil Empire #3) may be the best team 
in baseball now.  I wish I could stay up late enough to figure out why. 
The Rangers look like the puzzle pieces don't all fit.  Oakland looks 
primed for a second-half run again, but any 2 injuries and they're done. 
Seattle needs to be blown up and redone.
<i>((I think Oakland is quite an amazing story, Billy Beane is showing
again that he is THE best GM in baseball.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Ok, everyone who had the Nationals winning the division at this 
point in the season can clap.  (Why do I hear crickets chirping?)  Still, 
they appear to be on the downside while Atlanta is getting their hitters 
back and on the way up.  I'm ready to pick DC for the WC though.  Florida, 
the Mets and Philadelphia don't seem to be able to get over the hump.  I 
wonder which ones will be "sellers" at the deadline?
<i>((Obviously, this is slightly older info from the Goz, but I think
we need to clue him in to the Marlins pitching.  Since they did NOT
succeed in dumping AJ Burnett, the whole Marlins pitching staff has
been destroying the opposition.
I think this also does not bode well for the Astros, who also made a run
for awhile.
The WC race is the Marlins' to lose, even though everyone is close.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  The Cardinals pitching rotation of 2005 looks a lot like 
their pitching rotation of 2004, which still doesn't make sense to me. But 
it looks like I'd better get used to it.  The Astros actually are pulling 
themselves up to .500, and might make a WC run, but something that I can't 
put my finger on still seems wrong there.  Nonetheless, Clemens may be the 
most deserving pitcher in the Cy Young race this year.  The Cubs figured 
that all they had to do was stay in the WC race until Wood &amp; Prior came 
back and then they'd take off.  Wood &amp; Prior came back and they lost 8 in 
a row.  They've recovered since, but I've seen this show before, and it 
ends badly.  Milwaukee has done better than expected, but can't contend 
with what they have.  Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are still Tampa.
<i>((Wood is doing better relegated to the bullpen.... yeah, you're
right Houston and the Cubs just don't look like they have it.
I think Milwaukee's been doing just about precisely what ***I***
thought they would do.
Griffey keeps showing signs of almost becoming a superstar again, but
he just can't quite get over the hump.
Obviously, the Reds problem is pitching, but still, it seems that team
SHOULD be doing better than it is.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  It looks like the Padres win this by default, but I don't think 
anyone will know how good they are until October.  Right now I'm betting 
"not very good", but if you can get to the playoffs then anything is 
possible (except on the North Side of Chicago).  The Dodgers are without 
Gagne, the Giants without Bonds, the Diamondbacks without Schilling &amp; 
Johnson, the Rockies without talent.  Still, Arizona looks like it could 
make a run.  I'm just not betting that way.
<i>((Smart move, especially when the Padres can't get and stay over .500.
There still is a good chance we'll have an under .500 division winner!
Which means the Giants (who will get Bonds back in Sept. it looks like,
with strong motivation to pass Babe Ruth in a few short weeks, I think
he needs 12 moonshots), the Dodgers (who have good balance), and the 
Diamondbacks (gee, that lineup is so weak....) still have a good shot.
I bet on the Giants, who also acquired a streaking Randy Winn at the 
trade deadline and just got Moises Alou back from the DL, to win it
coming from behind with a below .500 record.
And then in the playoffs could do a bit of damage.
Of course, maybe I'm just justifying my preseason prediction.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now I've got the die-hard Cubs' fans' ultimate nightmare scenario 
for the WS:  White Sox &amp; Cardinals.  Since the White Sox last won a World 
Series they've THROWN a World Series, and the Red Sox have won twice. 
Sheesh.  Bring on football.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Nah, I think there is a REAL shot that the Marlins make it, or
that blend of young/old in the Braves.
What's with this guy Francoeur, or whatever his name is?
He's playing great.
And in the AL, Buehrle, Garland and Hermanson?
No way.... 
Cliff Politte is having a stellar ERA season which is good
since he may need to close when Hermanson gives out.
They've been resting him during the recent losing period,
and he blew his last save.
But the real worry is about those top two starters. 
Jon Garland has lost three of his last four.
He was only REALLY bad in that loss to Toronto
early in the month and in the game against the Red Sox (which
is of course the one that I listened to most closely).  His
loss to the Yankees wasn't that bad.  
I have not been paying much attention Contreras and Garcia,
since they didn't face 
the Red Sox in the last series.  I don't really know how
they've been doing and looking quickly, they've pitched
well lately, but they won't be playoff aces.
But Buehrle's lost his last two and over the last month
ALSO has come down substantially from where he was.
Including, again, with my Red Sox focus, a pretty 
dismal performance against the Sox.
I'd worry....
The highest likelihood is a Cardinals/Red Sox rematch, I think.
But don't count out the A's and the Marlins, and that would be
my "long shot prediction".))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Cubs' curse continues.  NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon came to Chicago in 
May to promote the then-upcoming NASCAR race (run two weeks ago), and was 
invited to sing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during the 7th inning of a 
Cubs' game.  He got introduced to the crowd, proclaimed over the 
microphone how glad he was to be at "Wrigley Stadium", then sang one of 
the worst renditions ever given by someone other than Mike Ditka (who was 
20 seconds late to the booth the first time, and still finished 10 seconds 
ahead of the organist).  Since then Gordon has finished 25th or worse in 7 
of the 9 races run, and has dropped from 3rd to 15th in the standings. 
Just to show it works the other way around, Kasey Kahne, last year's 
NASCAR rookie-of-the-year, who is having a real tough sophomore year (a 
win at Richmond notwithstanding...he's 21st overall), dropped by Fenway 
recently to promote the then-upcoming NASCAR race in New Hampshire.  The 
Red Sox haven't been the same since.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How does it look from there?
<i>((The Red Sox are in first place.... I stuck the rest in above....

I'm not sold on NY, though Giambi's rejuvenation will definitely help
them.  (I picked him up for my fantasy team, and he's my utility IF
with Ortiz as 1B).  The key will be the pitching: if Schilling can
return to his normal form and Foulke can make the stretch run, I'll
give the Sox the edge.  Put it this way: they're in first place in
spite of minimal contributions from their best two pitchers.  
<i>((I'm playing in the DipWorld fantasy team league where old
MadLad Marc Peters is wiping up the floor with all of us.
Interesting, through that same period, that was PRECISELY my
fantasy team lineup!
I held my nose and picked up Giambi there myself and rode
him through his hot streak, but I just cut him as Trot Nixon and
Moises Alou are coming off the DL to help the Red Sox and Giants
make their pennant runs respectively.
I also have both Foulke and Schilling there, so I doubly am hoping
for the same there, and that's precisely my view.
Schilling starts Thursday and Foulke will be back within a week or two.
I think, given the shortcomings of all the other AL teams, 
that makes the Red Sox the favorites now.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Balmer has the same problem they've had all year: not quite enough
pitching.  I still like Tejada as an MVP candidate.  
<i>((Much as I am a Bruce Chen rooter.... how can someone with THAT
little talent hang on.... hint, he's a lefty... you can't base a 
pennant run around THAT pitching staff.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Commenting on Goz's: "Toronto appears to have been a 
paper tiger based on how well they've done since Halliday got injured."))</i>
Losing him kills any hope they had.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And on: "Tampa is still Tampa."))</i>
Yes, a glorified minor league team.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And on the White Sox.... I suspect Rick agrees with me...))</i>
Are there rings for winning the AL central?  I think they'll see the
same fate the Mariners had a few years back:  they are not built for
the postseason.  I don't think they'll get past any of the Red
Sox/Angels/Yankees.  
I like Konerko and Magglio Ordonez.  Oh wait, he's gone.  Dye seems
ok.  Basically the White Sox have two starters having great seasons
and enough hitting to beat up the weaker teams.  
<i>((As I said above.... be careful predicting that will continue...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On Goz's: "Minnesota is playing like an ok team, but that won't do it."))</i>  
No, it won't.  But Santana should still be great to watch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And on: "Kansas City is still Tampa."))</i>
Right.
<i>((Unfortunately, as I remain something of a Kansas City fan,
Kansas City is becoming the DEFINITION of the worst team in baseball,
with this latest 19 game losing streak.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And Goz improperly labels...."The Anaheim Angels of Los Angeles 
California brought to you by Budweiser (hereafter referred to as 
`Evil Empire #3' may be the best team in baseball now."))</i>  
I wish Vlad (also on my fantasy team) would snap out his recent
slump.  Angels have decent starters and a good bullpen.  You can
definitely pencil them in for the playoffs.
<i>((They are definitely NOT the best team in baseball.
Chone Figgins is having a good year and has now cemented into
the leadoff spot, but last year's Red Sox hero,
Orlando Cabrera, has been pretty disappointing offensively.
And the bottom of the Angels lineup sprinkled with journeymen
like DaVanon is not that great.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And Goz also said: "The Rangers look like the puzzle pieces 
don't all fit."))</i>  
Chan Ho Park's contract continues to kill them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And on Oakland...))</i>
They have reconstituted their pitching staff, and it's good.   But
they'll have their usual problems with hitting, esp. if they sneak
into the playoffs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And Goz went on to opine: "Seattle needs to be blown up and redone."))</i>
And then there are the Mariners... :)
<i>((They're actually doing that!
Who's that hot young pitcher that they just brought up who has been wowing
opposing hitters?
They could be a good young team next year as they are going right now.
I would say they are doing "the right thing" as teams in their
position go.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Nats are 13 games over .500 even though they have scored 5 fewer
runs than they have allowed over the course of the season.  
<i>((And could this have been the strong signal for why they
weren't going to be able to keep it up.
While Georgie-porgie might have wished he had kept Nick Johnson,
that's not enough to build an offense around.))</i>
BTW, if anybody is trying to decide between Frank Robinson and Ozzie
Guillen for Manager of the Year, they need to seriously think about
the latter's outburst about Ordonez.
<i>((True, but Guillen's style is an interesting breath of fresh air
as opposed to the corporate style of Tito or Ken Macha.
I root for Guillen to make it as a manager.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Atlanta is a 1/2 game behind, and they've scored 81 more runs than
they've allowed.  Smart money would be on Atlanta.  Nats still look
for for the wildcard.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Goz then said: "I'm ready to pick DC for the WC though."
While Rick though he said: "I'm ready to pick DC for the WS though.",
to which he responded:))</i> 
I'll pick the Cardinals.
<i>((If the Cardinals are the Wild Card that will be SOME comeback by
Houston or someone else in the Central.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((To Goz's: "The Cardinals pitching rotation of 2005 looks a lot
like their pitching rotation of 2004, which still doesn't make sense to me."
Rick cogently comes back with:))</i> 
Check out Chris Carpenter and Mark Mulder.  Carpenter was injured in
the postseason last year, but is putting up Cy Young numbers.  Mulder
and Matt Morris look like very good #2 and #3 starters.
<i>((And Jeff Suppan.... after watching him a few years back really
stink it up for the Red Sox, he DOES seem to be doing it with mirrors.
So they may have a Number Four who will be susceptable to American
League DH's and parks.
Some pitchers really are styled better as NL as opposed to AL pitchers.
But I agree with Rick, the Cardinals top three are trumped only by the
Marlins in the NL, I'm not impressed by the Braves rotation as long as
Russ Ortiz struggles in coming back from his injury.))</i>  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((To: "Clemens may be the most deserving pitcher in the Cy Young 
race this year."))</i>  
Yes, Clemens has had bad luck, but he's only 7-4, whereas Carpenter
is 14-4.  That's too much of a disparity, even given Clemens'
excellent ERA.
<i>((We all understand, BUT, the prevailing wisdom seems to be that
Carpenter's overall stats are just too much better.
In many senses, I think this is wrong.
For example, the Astros current park is one of if not THE best 
hitters park in the NL once you factor out the other planet
that Coors Field exists on.
And Clemens has a positively microscopic road ERA this year.
He would challenge Bob Gibson's once thought unchallengeable
1.12 if he pitched somewhere else in the NL.
And, yes, he's an ageless wonder, which SHOULD count for something.
And his W-L record is really more of a factor than it should be 
given the abysmal Astros hitting for stretches this year.
Worse than just "bad" it's been "streaky bad" where in whole
stretches of games they just simply were not going to score.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I suspect the Padres will be good enough to lose to the Braves in the
first round.  Of course, the Braves tend to be bored by postseason
baseball, so who knows what'll happen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wouldn't worry about the White Sox.  I'm thinking Cardinals in the
NL, and any of Red Sox / Yankees / Angels in the AL, with my heart going
to the Red Sox.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Following up on your Payton question from a while back,  I still 
wouldn't say that he's the "regular" starter at any position, but he's 
certainly getting plenty of starts.  
<i>((I'm really just interested as in the "former Red Sox, did 
Theo Epstein drop Payton at the right time".
Of course, in retrospect, with the Trot Nixon injury, Payton would
have gotten lots of playing time with the Sox, but it provided the
opportunity to reacquire Gabe Kapler.
That's been one of the more amazing stories of the season, going
off to Japan to make some money and get more playing time, Gabe
really just stunk up the joint and came back in mid season.  
After the Red Sox traded Payton, they signed Gabe and he just
fit right back in.
They also traded for Jose Cruz, Jr., but quickly cut him as it
was clear that Kapler was going to be the fill in for Trot Nixon
and eventual fourth outfielder down the stretch. 
And Trot is coming back and looking REALLY good, so all is well....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Macha is a big believer in 
"letting the players write the lineup", i.e., whoever is hitting well 
gets put back in the next day.  Payton came in and hit a bunch of HRs 
in his first few games, so they kept playing him, rotating the other 
outfielders around to make room.  Now he's even gotten a couple of 
starts at CF - once on Saturday and again tonight - as Kotsay is a 
little worn out at the moment.  But there's still no question that 
Kotsay is the "real" CF and Payton is just subbing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At LF and RF it's less clear who is the regular.  Only half of our 
positions have a clear "first-stringer" now - CF, SS, 3B, and C.  
Swisher at RF is arguable, but I don't think he's really a definite 
fixture there, in part because he's our best 1B defensively.  LF, 1B 
and 2B are wide open.  A's are in the happy position where all but one 
of the hitters on the team are guys they want to find room for in the 
lineup, so that the difficult part of the decision is not whom to put 
in but whom to leave out.  Even Melhuse has been hot, so they're trying 
to get him in occasionally, either giving Kendall a day off or using 
one of them at DH.  The only hitter who's clearly second-string right 
now is Ginter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Payton is definitely being embraced by the team.  He's hitting well and 
he's not showing the bad attitude that many worried about.  When the 
trade was first made, there was talk that he'd be flipped to the 
Yankees, but it looks pretty certain that that won't happen now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gammons has written that he thinks Beane is done trading for this 
season.  I think he's done with big deals but will still do a few 
tweaks on the "sell high" side of the equation.  In the local coverage 
there have been little hints that newly acquired pitcher Joe Kennedy is 
not being embraced by the team, though no one is spelling out exactly 
why.  As I mentioned before, Kennedy was essentially acquired in exchange 
for Quintanilla, if you figure Payton-Byrnes and Bradford-Witasick to 
be straight across swaps in the same role.
<i>((From what I've been hearing it doesn't look like there will be
ANY significant waiver swaps at all, as no one is getting through the
glut of Wild Card contenders.
If there is a big deal it almost assuredly will be among the lower
tier of contenders.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Beane likes to gather players that he thinks will be in high demand down 
the road.  We didn't have any particular need for Kennedy, but Beane 
saw that he was in demand and thought he was a good pickup.  I see him 
flipping Kennedy to a contender that needs another starting pitcher, in 
exchange for prospects and/or a good bench player who will take 
Ginter's place on the roster.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, that is a neat idea, to grab value even though you don't
really need it, since then it can be traded for more once you give the
player the playing time to prove the value.
You could argue that's even true of Payton, that he's more valuable now
after being traded to Oakland.
I think lots of people need Kennedy, but he won't slip through 
waivers to get traded this month.
But of course, the real proof in the pudding is if Oakland can put
its act back together a bit better and make a good stretch run drive.
The Yankees and the Indians ARE beatable, but maybe the Indians will
be that Wild Card from nowhere.  
Somehow if the Yankees make it, that will be the real miracle.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Lastly from me, mostly because I have an inch or two of space at
the bottom of this page... since at least Rick Desper will appreciate
it, I'm getting kinda excited about watching the Boston Celtics this
year.
Local favorite Ryan Gomes will almost certainly be THE best second
round draft pickup.
The Celts gave him a two year (more or less) guaranteed contract when
they don't HAVE to give any second rounder guarantees and the first
round guarantee is only three years, just one year more.
And Danny Ainge is picking up a HOST of point guards to compete with
each other.
He and Doc Rivers are going to tell them to run, run, run and drive
the team.
Whoever picks it up the best will make the team.
Pure competition.
Plus, Antoine Walker is traded, in what should be a good deal
for both.
Antoine DID have to back off on the last two years of his
guaranteed six year deal - the last two years are now a
club option of some kind - once they saw 'Toine's knees.
He really is an amazingly intense individual and plays through 
an amazing amount of pain.))</i>

I'll be taking over Phil Reynolds' two regular Diplomacy games somewhere in <i>TAP</i>.
One or both games might go to Harold Reynolds' subszine, since Colonia is over.
I have Phil's last issue, #44, but that was published way back in December of 
2003.
I'm not sure if people have moved or whatever in that time, so a little help would
be appreciated.
And I hope everyone comes back, but I might need some standbys.
I am STILL not hearing from too many of you!!! 
I'm going to start nagging so I can get these restarted.
Please let me know if you care playing, thanks to Karl Schmit for responding
each time that he's in....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England), 
John Power (Germany), Tim Snyder (Italy), and Fred Wiedemeyer (Russia)
are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.
Paul Risner probably is not going to be able to continue in the game.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Marvin Baker is forced to resign via a job responsibility change.
We wish him the best.
I'm calling Jeff O'Donnell to replace him.
Jeff wanted to be a new standby and so best to jump people in
right when they ask.
Also, since most of you are postal vets you will be able to handle
the fact that Jeff isn't on the Internet, and if necessary you
guys can handle phone calls.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) There is a proposal to change the name of the game to Spiralling Pancakes.
The proposer wished it to be "NVR yes" because if none of you cared to
vote against it, that should be reason enough to change it.
But that won't go here.
If you don't vote, it vetoes the proposal.
But go ahead, vote with your Spring orders, though I don't see how you possibly
could want to take "paranoia" out of the game name....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) There also is a proposal for a six way TAG IRE draw which will of course
blame everything that happened in this game on the Irish. 
This is a usual proposal where failure to vote of course vetoes the proposal,
but also vote on that with your Spring orders.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) I had a some trouble with deciphering and reproducing some of the press items
below, I hope it is readable.
I have to translate all special characters here, it can be done, but I have
to do it manually. 
So keep that in mind.
I did my best for this press.

(EPISODE 10 "NEW HOPE"): 
<i>((Aren't we mixing metaphors here.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CAPTAIN'S LOG: Things are looking up.
The Tribbles are in full retreat and the Federation has maintained its end
of our treaty.
The only question is whether the Romulans are going to attack.
(Kirk's (K) quarters door rings, it's McCoy (M), Spock (S), and 7 of 9 (7))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Captain, I think we have found a way to change us back into human form.
If we can predict the next attack by the Tribbles or Romulans, we can
place a Genesis device at the exact location,
if we modify it with one of 7's Borg silicone implants and some of my
brain engrams from that lame "Spock's Brain" episode.
<i>((Brain, brain, what is brain?!?!?!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Why do we need 7's implants and your engrams?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: My implants have a Borg temporal signature from that "First Contact"
movie where the Borg went back in time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M: Damn it, Jim!
I saw that movie, 7 wasn't even in it!
In fact, she's not even in the original series!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: No Doctor, but I bought a black market copy on disc off the Internet
and I downloaded it into the matrix of my Borg silicone implants.
As for how I got into this series of episodes, who can say?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Can I touch those implants before we use them in combat?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: Not if you want to live!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: In any event, the implants and my engrams with our original 
universe memories stored there will, in theory, change the 
perpendicular universe Federation back into Ferengi and should
change us back into human form and our Federation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: How will we get 7 away from the blast in time?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: We will do one of those boring, predictable episodes where
we try to transport her out, we can't for some silly and not
really believable reason, and then Mr. Scott will do his 
idiot miracle worker routine at the last second to save 7
with the transporter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'll have you know, as we give Jimmy Doohan and Mr. Scott proper
respect upon the former's passing, that switching to Channel B is NOT
an idiot miracle worker routine!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M: But Mr. Scott just died.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Yes, Doctor, but you've been dead for five years and you're still
here annoying me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Sounds like a plan, but we have to predict the exact location of the

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note Doug Kent's "unit location" adjustment.  Sorry if I missed him
telling me about it before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) A GA-GA draw has been proposed.  
Please vote with your Spring orders.
If you fail to vote, it vetoes the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DOUG KENT LAMENTS): Poor James Doohan.... poor Texas Rangers... poor me!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DOUG): Indeed!
Although Jimmy Doohan's passing was something of a blessing since he really
was not doing well at all.
The Rangers still need pitching, and to do without pitchers who can't keep
their temper under control.
I hope you are hanging in there, no long update presumes you are in the
long summer doldrums of boredom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROM LONDON): So, guys, you're going to let me live, right?  Guys?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ALL): Please note my Unit is Unit E, not Unit F.
Anybody feel like writing?
Just because I root for losing teams like the Texas Rangers and the 
NY Football Giants is no reason to hate me.
But if you want <b>good</b> reasons to hate me, just ask!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!
New game start in this, who wants to play again (or for the first time)???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note I added the efficiency scores above and just reported the final
finishers.
There wasn't enough left to do to bother scoring a full turn.
Congratulations to Rick for going out in front and staying there for the
victory.
Astute calculations!
And he did even better in the efficiency score than he did in points.
Any last comments any of you have should come in for next issue.
I'm also hoping to start a new game then, I hope many of you will
play again.
