<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR BRENTON VER PLOEG AND....</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>We have more from Brenton Ver Ploeg which should be of interest
to our old timers....
This actually was a search with a twist.  
I actually am offering up TWO $50 rewards.
The first reward was finding for Brenton - that goes to Pete
Gaughan, which he will use to get some of his szine collection into
the Bowling Green Diplomacy Archives.
The second is for resolving a certain mystery that currently exists
in our hobby for which Brenton is particularly well qualified to solve.
I have shared with Brenton ALL of the information I currently have on this
mystery and he will thus have the leg up to get the second $50 reward.
I won't be announcing another person to search for until Issue #235
while we allow time to search this mystery.
Feel free to assist Brenton or others to solve it.
I shall be saying nothing more about it.

<p>
Or spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
I can't believe Garret isn't on the Internet somewhere these days
for example.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

Dear Jim: Buddy Tretick?  Gene Prosnitz?
Don't these people know how to stay retired?
Gene was in my first (1968CI) and last (dunno the number,
but it was a demo game in Hoosier Archives in maybe 1972)
games.
He was always a good player.
<i>((And he still is, he's been something of a ``Colonia''
specialist for the last decade or so.
That's why he is here.))</i>
Buddy flailed around a few games I was in but whether he
was an active participant is a rather more subjective issue.
He dropped out of the hobby after developing an, er, quixotic
reputation.           
<i>((Oh yes, I know.
I'm glad as part of searching for him in this same section,
I convinced him to come back as himself.
I think it is the right thing to do, but he still is....
to quote Al Gore, unique.
This next section of your letter is relevant to the other part of this

<p>
Jim;  More on the World Dip Tourney and reply to Leif Bergman:
     
<p>
I am playing in the game with your team member Aron Ambrosiani who as a
HS student is showing remarkable tactical and diplomatic skill.  However,
his SCs are about to shrink.  He remarked that he is used to playing FTF and
the deadline is ordinarily 8 years only!  He was having trouble adapting to
the longer 12 years!  And I'm having trouble accepting that most games will
end in draws - after the unlimited life of games in <i>TAP</i> and the 
rest of the PBM hobby.  The timeline does change strategy - or should.
<i>((Yeah, it SHOULD, but many players used to playing 8 years have done just
that and ended their games.  Almost everyone had to ``adapt", as I believe
I mentioned before the tournament started.  The only surprise I had was
how many TOTALLY useless HS students there were out there, good to hear
one that actually played.  One in my game was one of those people without
a real E-Mail account and only could access the game through the web at
school and he wasn't really paying attention, even then.))</i>

<p>
In the game I GM'd I expected that there would be a little scurry of
grabbing available SCs in the last 1-2 years of the game, but they voted for
a draw instead.  Peculiar I thought.  Is that customary as well?
<i>((This is what they refer to as ``carebear" strategies
or draw whittling.  There  are a number
of pockets of the hobby that play this way (they got down to three or four
players first, right??) and many games have turned out like this.
The game I GMed also did this, after eliminating World Class Dipper
Chris Martin.
This is a different pocket than the European continental FTFers who 
are used to playing C-DIPLO at tournaments with 1908 game stops.
The 1912 idea comes from the British FTF tournament style, but most
Brit tournaments build in a randomization, so it ends somewhere 
between 1910 and 1914 (??? I forget the details) and you don't know
whether the game has ended until the Winter adjustment point.
Brit tournaments do this by enforcing uniform deadlines though, which
they couldn't do here and they didn't want different games with
different ending points.))</i>

<p>
I had thought almost no games would end as solos.  For those not
involved, if there is a solo, only the winner gets any points to help
his/her team.  If there isn't a solo, then all survivors get points.  Seems
a no brainer to insure that a stop-the-leader happens because no matter how
many SCs the toady has, they still get zero points.  I would expect that the
next round will be tighter and all games will be draws.
<i>((Probably the case, I generally agree.  Forming stop-the-leaders was made
more difficult by the nature of player assumption disagreements.
I couldn't form one in my game, because one player wouldn't communicate
at all (and this was the one that visited me in person in Providence
in the middle of the game and I told him what I was doing STRAIGHT
to his face) and another wouldn't put his cards on the table and I
suspected had a secret alliance with the player who won.  It is much
easier with people in the same ``milieu" to form STL's.))</i>

<p>
Jim, I share your sentiments of over-involvement in this one game in the
tourney.  I ``came out of retirement" for this game and it's been a lot of
work.  A fascinating game, but I already knew that I could get hooked again
on playing Dip - thus I have been avoiding it.  I just made a tactical
error, and wonder whether or not a subconscious desire to insure I don't get
into the semis was at play!
<i>((Yes, I did the same thing in my game and I KNOW that subconscious desire
was involved.  After that, I was consciously playing for second place,
for my team.))</i>

<p>
Great, great time.  I recommend all readers get involved in next year's
tournament.

<p>
And, your joke about the chess nuts, heard that most of my life.  I
believe those kind of jokes are called ``spoonerisms."  The chess nuts one is
imperfect however, because there is not exact transposition of two or more
initial consonants.  The ``b" that changes roasting into boasting would have
to come from somewhere and the ``r" should go there.
<i>((Yes, it is a bad one.  I was hoping someone had heard some similar one
specifically for Dippers and would write it in.  I first heard it in
high school at my chess club in the 1970's.))</i>
The only other one that comes to mind right now from the same vintage is
something about ``singing in the nun's line, shelly" and imagine the set-up.
<i>((Yeah!))</i>

Hi Jim, In response to your personal note of some time ago:

<p>
``The new Diplomacy software is awful!!  Hasbro has balls of gold, can they
cash in w/such a terrible product?"

<p>
No, they're not going to be cashing in.  I doubt the game will sell well.
First of all, as you said, it sucks.  I gave it 1 1/2 stars in my review in
Computer Gaming World (see Feb '00 issue) and I've seen it panned just about
everywhere.  Its $45 selling price puts it in a category where it's very
unlikely to sell.  The whole PC games industry is changing rapidly, and is
becoming increasingly hit-driven.  I think Hasbro thinks they can just skim
some money off the AH product line with minimal development costs, but the
market won't support it.  It would have worked five years ago.  Not now.

<p>
I'm surprised Hasbro is involved with Avalon Hill at all in the computer
game arena.  They're making a bunch of really stupid moves right now (see
Gunship!) so we'll see what happens.

<p>
While I'm writing, thought I'd mention that it's obvious that either Alan
Stewart was drunk when he compiled his best movies of the 1980's list, or
that the Rehnquist court has made him so giddy that he's unable to think
clearly.  
<i>((Dish, dish, do tell!))</i>
What about <i>Blue Velvet</i>?  What about <i>The Sacrifice</i>, possibly the
greatest movie ever made?  <i>Kiss of the Spider Woman</i>?  Anyone who lists
<i>Working Girl</i> in a list like that is clearly beyond hope.  
<i>((I think he was intentionally trying NOT to be too intellectual about
his choices, but that one went a step too far for me too.))</i>
I'm not going to
dignify that list with any further response.  Didn't he try to pass himself
off at some point as some sort of conservative intellectual (<i>Praxis</i>)?  
Now it seems he's more like the I.F. Stone of movie selection.  
Lubyanka for him!

<i>((Yes, see elsewhere, where I am signing you up for the

I hope Sunday was just as entertaining as Saturday's

fleet in Brest and an Austrian fleet in Naples, I
can't imagine it was.

<p>
I look forward to providing cannon fodder again for
you all soon. Well, maybe not too soon, because after
John's inspiring description of his eight-month old as

Thanks, here are some quick comments from me....
David Partridge's family all got sick and he stayed home to take
care of them.  So Jack and I talked about doing it again earlier than
usual..... in say June.  And Doug is still planning another Vermont
event in July.  No one was willing to pay EITHER Doug or I</i> $<i>25 for
our autographs.  There was much lamenting all round.... well, actually
just from Doug and me.  I wasn't able to come back on Sunday, but
Ralan and his promised Tufts crowd did NOT show up on Saturday and
it really was one of our smaller crowds - disappointing, you might say.)) 

<p>
((On the plus side, there was a hell of a Diplomacy game and I got a chance
to try out Devil Take the Hindmost, a cycling game I just picked up.
As I said, I did not come back on Sunday, but John Fitzgerald had a
real good position as England that they were going to pick back up
in the morning.  Unfortunately, the Austrian and Italian players did
a ``publically announced alliance" in Spring 1901 and were routed out
of the game very quickly.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Doug Massey (7 Mar 2000 00:05:15 GMT)</b>

<p>
On Saturday there were seven players who started around noon - Jim-Bob
showed up around 3 pm.  We drew randomly and played 15 minute deadlines.

<p>
Austria:  Chris Lockheardt

<p>
England:  John Fitzgerald of AOL fame.

<p>
France:   Adam Silverman, sophomore at MIT

<p>
Germany:  Jack Sinnott, host of the game.

<p>
Italy:    Bob Rodday (?), friend and neighbor of Chris

<p>
Russia:   Doug Massey, pin-cushion-extraordinaire

<p>
Turkey:   Avi Pfeffer, Harvard prof and Vermonster.

<p>
As Jim-Bob mentioned, AI announced that they were friends, neighbors,
and allies.  After Jack taught them the Lepanto opening (!), Chris
came to Avi and I separately and told us that we needed to plead
our case for AI to attack the other one.  Avi and I then went away
and incredulously agreed on an RT alliance.  Both players were 
eliminated by 1905 or so.

<p>
An EFG started out, with EG tricking me into taking Sweden in 1901
but leaving my northern land defenseless in 1902.  I made a horrid
mistake by building F Stp(NC) rather than (SC), and it was land-locked
and useless for the entire game.  I never moved in the north.

<p>
EFG took turns switching allies for the entire game.  I swear, two
turns never passed without a change in the alliance structure.  
<i>((This is a pleasant tendency in the Incident games, except
for the time that John Quarto and Pitt Crandlemire did one on me
and kept an alliance that I thought was shifting.))</i>
Jack made a mistake or two that cost him a chance at the upper hand (he
walked through a center, rather than staying in it in the fall and
taking it from France; he also was hemmed in too tightly by the 
English fleets - if I handn't messed up the STP build, though, we 
could have arranged something . . .).  Adam scooted into the Med to
pick up what he could from the AI demise, while John just lorded over
the northern third of the map.

<p>
Turkey's gains in the south made him the early leader at about nine
centers; I attacked him just as he was about to make a push for 
the Atlantic.  I felt a stab was imminent; Avi says this was not the
case, so it was another mistake on my part.  Avi rearranged himself
and stopped me cold - Germany also slipped into a center and damaged
my ability to make any progress.

<p>
I then lost both fleets and was reduced to five centers and armies.
EGT apparently saw fit to eliminate one variable from the game.  I
went from five to zero in one year.  In the fall, having lost two 
centers already and defending War, Mos and Vie with armies there and 
in Gal and Ukr, I found my five armies surrounded by TEN enemy armies.
They got together and plotted my demise.  No set of orders could have
saved me at that point.

<p>
The damage had been done to Turkey, though; France and England were
now in better position than he.  Germany was really stuck in the middle
and Jack played Adam and John against each other as best he could, 
staying alive and biding his time in an effort to survive until 
he wasn't the best target on the board.  But they took him down to
four centers by the end of the night and declared an EFT draw (with 
9-9-12 centers, I think) the next morning.

The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll find a commercial service to copy them for me.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.

<p>
To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
a free tape).
Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
That showed the value of getting in early!!
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson ($5),
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
Round 2 E-Mail voters were Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch.
Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee, and Andy York.

We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.

Jim,
I just purchased the sound track to the movie ``The Beach".  I have never
purchased a movie sound track before in my life (although someone once gave
me a tape of ``Clockwork Orange") . I was driven to buy this one since it
contains the new New Order song ``Brutal" - their first new song in about 6
years.  I, of course, knew ``Brutal" would be great, but was very impressed
with the rest of the album as well. The songs by Blur, All Saints, and
Faithless are outstanding as well.  There are only a couple of bad songs on
the album.  Too bad the movie is so lousy.

<i>((You probably heard that Rutgers beat Notre Dame last night and

They will lose ;-)  but it should get them a good seeding for the
National Tournament (I would guess a Number 2).  Any way that you
get to see or hear these games?  The Championship tonight is on
``The Deuce", I think.))</i>
College basketball is simply not covered.  I can watch one or two NBA
games per week, if I want.  But I prefer college.  
I'm not surprised that Rutgers is in the Finals.  They've given UConn
fits in the past, but this year's team is the best UConn team I've
seen (including the 35-0 team).  Definitely in the Final Four, and
they should be the favorites to win the championship.  

<p>
The UConn men are not quite as good.  Still, they suffered a lot this
year as every team they faced was juiced to try to beat the National
Champs.  Still they showed they could beat Duke, Arizona, Texas, and
Syracuse.  If they get lucky, they could be Final Four.  If unlucky,
only Sweet Sixteen.  I predict they lose in a regional final.  

<p>
I could catch some games on ESPN radio online.  Or whatever Armed
Forces Radio has.  I listened to Red Sox/Yankees via ESPN radio.  Not

While I'm blabbing...my next job will be in the DC region.  My

<p>
I got the bike race game in the mail from John.  Expect some press on
this topic (and others) in the coming days.  I hope to bring it to
Baltimore, though I haven't totally fixed my plans yet.

<p>
<i>((I really thought ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' was dreck.  Notice the way
they played the end few scenes.  That voiceover at the end indicated
to me that they changed the ending.  He was supposed to kill 
the last person he met on the boat (instead of the 
one the final script had him killing) in the original shooting
script was my bet..... the movie would have been better if it dealt
more with the women.  Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow
were nearly completely wasted.))</i>

<p>
I'd have to look at the book.  The movie would have been MUCH better
had they stopped about 15 minutes before they did.  I just didn't buy
the ending.  It made no sense to me.  I guess the idea was that he
couldn't kill the other character since the whole family was
there, so he had to use the other solution.  But wouldn't it have been
much, much easier for him to just admit that he wasn't Dickie
Greenleaf?  So that person is pissed off at him and the family is a bit
embarrassed.  Who cares?  He hasn't solved his ultimate problem of
confused identities, just delayed it.  

<p>
I just liked the idea that they should have stopped the movie at the
point where Daddy Greenleaf has decided that he's a good guy, and
Gwyneth is ignored as a hysterical female.  

<p>
Overall, I didn't think the movie was <i>that</i> great, but I identified
somewhat with the guy with Princeton envy and the whole expatriate
thing.  
<i>((I liked it a whole lot less than that....))</i>

<p>
I saw ``American Beauty,'' but dubbed in German.  I think I missed a lot
since Kevin Spacey's voice is so important.  But I was on the whole
not as impressed with this movie.  It seems the central theme of the
movie is that you should fear nothing.  Well, that's great if you're
young and without responsibilities, but most adults cannot
realistically follow the devil-may-care path the Spacey character
takes.  Still, it was a lot better than most of the stuff Hollywood
makes, and certainly a level higher than ``Braveheart", ``Forrest Gump",
and ``Saving Private Ryan" which were all just sentimental tripe.
(Though ``Gump" was at least a nice nostalgic tour.)
<i>((I never did see ``Forrest Gump'' or ``Saving Private Ryan''.
Was Tom Hanks in both of those?
I like watching Tom Hanks awful movies much better, especially
his screwball comedies from the 1980's.))</i>

<p>
I thought Ripley was a little better than American Beauty since I
could actually imagine this story happening.  What I really liked were
the characters of Dickie Greenleaf and Freddie Miles.  They seemed
quite realistic to me.  The story really captures the class
differences well.  The real thing to say about this movie is that Jude
Law steals it from Matt Damon.  Once Law is out of the picture, the
movie becomes much less interesting.  
<i>((That's for damned sure.  Jude Law was the best thing in the movie.
He is a really good actor.
Another movie that should have generated a ``Best Supporting Actor''
nomination was ``The End of the Affair'', where Stephen Rea played
against his usual type absolutely brilliantly!
It's a crime that got ignored.
A really good flick, too.))</i>

<p>
There's a common theme in Ripley and American Beauty which I've
noticed a lot with Hollywood movies: it's OK to have gay characters as
long as they are either dying of AIDS or they kill somebody.  
Ripley was rather deceptively advertised.  They made it seem like
Ripley was really after Marge as a romantic partner, when really it
seems quite clear that he was after Dickie.
<i>((Absolutely.
All my gay friends thought that the gay characters in both movies
were portrayed with DEADLY accuracy.
I couldn't help it....))</i>

<p>
In any case, I thought ``Three Kings'' was much, much better than either
of these two.  ``Three Kings'' was also poorly advertised.  It seemed like
basically a remake of Kelly's Heroes if you believed the trailers.
This movie is so much more!  It really captures how Americans are
viewed abroad, how the media interacts with military conflicts in such
a random nature, how modern politics can be so gonzo at times, etc.  
And it quite graphically shows how modern weapons kill.  That in
itself is amazing.  A nice contast to the Rambo genre.
<i>((Everyone I know who has seen it agrees with you entirely.
I missed it, but plan to rent it on video.))</i>

<p>
I think George Clooney is becoming the underappreciated star of
Hollywood.  For the most part, he's making very good movies with
intelligent scripts (``From Dusk 'Till Dawn'' excluded - but Clooney was
really good in this movie) but he's not making a lot of money.  But
I'd take him over Tom Cruise any day.  
<i>((His big 1998 movie ``Out Of Sight'' was probably my favorite 
movie that year.
``Three Kings'' looks like more of the same.))</i>

<p>
Rick,
I just want to send some of my picks on to you so that you know I
made the choices before the games started, but obviously <i>TAP</i> 
won't come out until after the games begin.  From this you
can construct my full bracket.

<p>
I always choose too many first round upsets, but I really hate
MISSING a first round upset.  To keep myself under control, I
limit myself to 12 upsets out of 32 first round games (obviously
the other games I have the favorite by seeding winning).
<i>((My 13th upset was going to be Seton Hall over Oregon, 
which of course is the only one I missed.... but more on that
below.))</i>

<p>
First Round Upsets: Fresno St. (lots of experience, good guard
play), Indiana St. (mostly a vote against Texas who I know REALLY
well, but coach Rick Barnes and star Chris Mihm
have a disturbing tendency to let down in
the big games), Winthrop (a hunch admittedly...), Gonzaga (am I
stuck in last year?  Perhaps), St. Louis (NOT a fluke that they
are here, peaking enough to get by Utah), Samford (another hunch,
also motivated by Syracuse's point guard Jason Hart being in the tank with
no back up), Creighton (they don't have the big man and they don't
have the athletes, but this team WORKS harder than any team in
the country, has a good young coach who will be really hot if
they go deep into the tournament, though probably they just win
this game), DePaul (gee, can Kansas ever play well?), Penn
(seriously!  Penn's Michael Jordan is a real athlete), Pepperdine
(my man Chuck Wilson likes them and that's enough for me, plus
Booby (sic) Knight is a disgrace, again...), Missouri (I hate UNC
and this is a good time to hate them), and Arkansas (I know Miami
VERY well, saw Arkansas play early and then they peaked late).

<p>
<p>
<center>My Sweet Sixteen -</center><br>

<p>
West: Arizona, LSU, Purdue, and St. John's (with form after 
first round upset of Oklahoma).

<p>
Midwest: Michigan St. (I like them, for awhile), Kentucky,
UCLA, and Iowa St.

<p>
East: Duke, Florida (go, Billy Donovan!), Pepperdine (this
is my major picked Sweet Sixteen surprise, I may not be
picking enough upsets in this round!), and Temple (everyone's
favorite matchup zone).

<p>
South: Stanford, UConn, Ohio St., and Tulsa (I like Tulsa
getting Cinci a lot).

<p>
<i>((Late comment, since SO few upsets occurred in Round #1,
I am set up to possibly do really well in Round #2.
Only one mistake at this writing, addressed below in discussion
with Rich Goranson....))</i>

<p>
<p>
<center>Regional Finals -</center><br>

<p>
West: I have St. John's beating LSU (a one seed out from LSU,
with late injury having impact, I think St. John's will be on
a real run).

<p>
Midwest: I have UCLA beating everyone's favorite, Michigan St.
UCLA is on the run.  Once I made this pick, I heard others
making it too.

<p>
East: I think Temple beats Duke (Duke has a great team, but
it is a year short of another Final Four run and I think this
is John Chaney's time).

<p>
South: Ohio St. beats UConn (I surely am picking Khalid El-Amin
too far before he has his bad game and UConn goes out, Scoonie
Penn surely does it here if Stanford doesn't, I don't like
the ones this year...).

<p>
<p>
<center>Final Four -</center><br>

<p>
I am happy getting everyone here but am at a loss as to who
wins at that point.  I have two twos, a three, and a six.
Historically, the low seeded team always goes out in the first
Final Four game, so that is UCLA and gets St. John's to the
final, where I say they lose to Ohio St.  I will be rooting
for all of these teams at this point though.  Go Scoonie
and Jim O'B.

<p>
<b>Women's Tournament</b>: Shea Ralph and the UConn Huskies 
win it all.
Rutgers is the other team that this szine is watching, but
they can't beat the Lady Huskies.
Shea Ralph has become the consummate team player this year,
which makes everyone on the team better.

The Gods of sport must really hate Western New York. I really wonder what we 
have done to offend them so badly. We've had to deal with ``Wide Right", ``No 
Goal", ``Forward Lateral", NHL rule changes after controversial losses in 
successive playoffs (the Bondra goal in the conference finals two years ago 
and the Hull goal that clinched the Cup for Dallas last year), an NFL rule 
change after a controversial Bills loss to New England last year that cost 
them a division title, two NHL rules in the last two years to combat specific 
Sabres players (the ``Ray" rule and the ``Biron" rule) and now we have THIS. 

<p>
When St. Bonaventure beat Temple in the Pit in Olean earlier this year we 
knew this team had a chance to be special. They cruised through the regular 
season and they were 21-8 going into the A10 conference final against their 
old arch enemy on their home court. Yet still we thought we might be screwed. 
If Bona did indeed beat Temple in the final it was going to take a miracle 
for them to even be ranked ahead of them in the Big Dance and if they lost 
they might not even go at all. Such is the luck of WNY sports teams. Well 
they were stomped and we were prepared for the worst, but the convincing win 
over Dayton in the A10 semis garnered them some support and the best WNY team 
in over a quarter century (and only the second one to reach the tournament 
since the 73 Bonnies (a weak Canisius team won the MAAC in 97 and was 
promptly squashed by #2 Utah) got in, although with a few qualifications: 

<p>
1) They got a 12 seed instead of the 7, 8 or 9 they deserved. 
<i>((I don't think so, other than Temple, the A10 was REALLY awful this
year.
Cruising through the A10 was not impressive.
I think their seeding was just right.
And that isn't to say I don't like the Bonnies, I do.
They have the best home court advantage in the nation, which does help
them, but they tend to rely on it a bit too much.))</i>

<p>
2) They got placed in the Midwest regional instead of the East regional which 
was being held in Buffalo for the first time since 1954.
<i>((Yeah, well, as a 12 seed, you will admit that they didn't really
deserve to get that home court advantage?
Only top seeds get that.))</i>
 
<p>
3) They drew the winningest team in college basketball history; the 
University of Kentucky, as their first opponent. 
<i>((But eminently beatable, as Syracuse showed.))</i>

<p>
4) They would be the first game in the entire tournament. 
<i>((Hey, that actually was a chance to set a tone.
After they blew it, the rest of the First Round was a disgrace 
from my point of view.))</i>

<p>
It was a recipe for disaster. And yet disaster did not happen. The 
Bona-Kentucky game was the best first round game I have ever seen in the 
tournament. But in the end the result was one WNY sports fans are used to...

<p>

<center>St. Bonaventure 80, Kentucky 85 (2 OT)</center><br>

<p>
When Tim Winn's game tying trey rattled off the rim as time ran out in the 
second overtime the hearts of every sports fan from Olean to Buffalo to 
Rochester sunk again, as they have so many times over the last decade. Is 
there nothing we can do to get a win in a critical situation? Is there no 
higher authority we can go to? Is everyone going to continually put the prize 
within our grasp only to take it away at the last moment? Is there a reason 
that leagues are so afraid of WNY teams that they have to go out of their way 
in order to shaft us, as the NHL has done? The saga will never end for us. 
The curse of the Cigarette Smoking Man is not just against the Bills; it is 
against the entire city.

A very surprising low number of upsets in the first round, especially
if one thinks, like I did, that Gonzaga and Pepperdine should have

Well, I suppose I don't really think that UConn should make the Final
Four, but they are the lowest seed that really could conceivably do
so.  (Unless you believe in Tulsa or Pepperdine.)
<i>((UCLA is a six and they have an excellent Final Four chance,
they just killed Maryland.))</i>

<p>
I think, if they were healthy, they ought to beat Tennessee.  After
that, they probably would not be able to handle Stanford.  Voskuhl has
been a big disappointment this year.  Based on where he was last year,
he should have been a big presence in the Big East this year.
Instead, the team was embarrassed twice by Notre Dame primarily
because nobody could stop Troy Murphy, who played like Voskuhl should
have played.  

<p>
I think Ohio State could beat Cincinnati w/o Kenyon Martin, and think
that, if somehow UConn were to beat Stanford, they would beat Ohio
State because Jim Calhoun always beats Jim O'Brien.  

<p>
I think the logical outcome for UConn this year is two wins and then a
loss.  That's about where they are.  Not enough scoring, weak
frontcourt play, and too many people who started thinking themsselves
to be too good because of the championship (namely Voskuhl and
El-Amin).  

<p>
According to ESPN.com, Syracuse just beat Kentucky by 2.  Probably
bodes poorly for Tubby Smith, as the team has been going steadily
downhill since he took over.  (Which is a bit surprising to me.)

<p>
On the Big East:
Yes, if you could take the top 8 teams and trim the rest off, the
conference would certainly be stronger than the ACC.  But the power
rankings people always drag the Big East down because of the bottom
few teams.   
With the win by Syracuse, I would not be surprised to see 3 or 4 Big
East teams in the Sweet Sixteen.

Well, Florida needed a miracle to win against Butler and the Hall pulled off 
a good one versus Oregon. But the Bona-UK game was as probably as good as its 
going to get. And if you picked UK to win you obviously never watched Bona 
play this year. Kentucky was overrated and the Bonnies were underrated. This 
was a game between equals but conferences and reputations and not talent made 
UK a #5 seed and Bona a #12 seed.  Siena was snubbed from the tournament and 
now has a good chance to run the table in the NIT after beating UMass. 
<i>((I do disagree with you about the Bonnies being underrated.
You don't really have much of an argument for strength of the A10.
Unless Temple really kicks some butt, the A10 will have nothing to
show for this season, in the NCAA's or the NIT.
The Bonnies were REALLY lucky to get chosen at all.
I do agree with you in general about Kentucky.))</i>

<p>
I think it's not a coincidence that in NCAA football you've had two teams run 
the table and not have a chance at the national title in the two years the 
BCS has been in effect. It's like saying ``Only these six conferences have a 
chance. If you're from another conference you might as well not even play." 
I'm sure the fans of Tulane and Marshall feel that way. They deserved a 
chance to prove it on the field, not by the biases of the voters. 

<p>
The same seems to be true in the seeding in the Big Dance. If a team like 
Idaho State goes 28-2 and loses their conference final, they may not even get 
in, much less be ranked highly. Bona was screwed this year because:

<p>
1) They are a small school

<p>
2) They play in what has traditionally been a two team conference (Temple and 
UMass) and not a conference that is well respected nationwide (the A10)

<p>
3) They are in a rural area quite far away from urban population centres

<p>
4) They haven't been to the tournament since 1973

<p>
5) They are from an area where college basketball is very weak

<p>
That is why they were a #12 seed. That is why they drew a perennial power in 
the first round. And that is why they're back home in Olean now. Its money 
conference bias...and it makes me sick.

<p>
<i>((In general, I am sympathetic to these types of arguments, but 
St. Bonaventure did NOT play a strong non-conference schedule and the
A10 was even worse than usual this year.
I just don't think the Bonnies were that good.))</i>

Syracuse beats Kentucky in a battle of two perennial NCAA basketball powers. 
The Orangemen win 52-50 on Preston Shumpert's 19-foot jumper with 37 seconds 
left to advance to the Sweet 16. Kentucky loses in the second round for the 
first time since 1994.

UCLA?  Don't know much about them other than that they finished the
season strong.  Don't think they would beat MSU.
<i>((We'll see, I still think they will.))</i>

<p>
Hey - I see Arizona lost.  Not a big surprise there.  I felt they were
overrated.  I picked Purdue to make the Sweet Sixteen.  
<i>((As did I, I had LSU making the Elite Eight, which still looks
like a good pick to me.))</i>
But now the whole West bracket is wide open.  
Probably should jump back on the Gonzaga bandwagon.

<p>

<center>Rick, R.Desper of DKFZ-Heidelberg.de</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Yeah, I picked the WRONG team from that conference.  Oklahoma St.
edged Pepperdine today and now with St. John's down, I will be   
rooting for Gonzaga to take St. John's place.  I watched the
Gonzaga/St. John's game, it was REALLY good.
I still like my Ohio State and UCLA picks a lot.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rich Goranson (Sun, 19 Mar 2000 17:38:19 EST)</b>

<p>
It seems you got your upsets in the second round and not in the first.
<i>((Yeah, a big surprise.
I still have half the teams in the Sweet Sixteen and four of the nine
teams seeded fifth or higher that made it.
The only other one of you involved in this discussion who I had a whole
bracket for was Jamie McQuinn, who only had 5/16 and just one of the
upsets and that being Florida who is the only five seed remaining. 
What is really difficult is that the teams that I knew the best, from
the Big East, I had precisely backwards.
The two I had making the Sweet Sixteen were out and the three I had
out made the Sweet Sixteen.
If you flip those five teams as well as getting the right team between
Pepperdine and Gonzaga I would have had a stellar record.
The other ones I missed were heart/head battles (disliking North
Carolina and liking Lute Olsen and Arizona more than they deserved).))</i>

<p>
Temple gone. Stanford gone. Cincinnati gone. Illinois crushed by a team that
was lucky to get out of the first round. Maryland hammered. Arizona gone. St.
John's gone.
At this rate the favourite will end up being Gonzaga.

<p>

<center>Rich Goranson, Amherst, NY, ForlornH of aol.com</center><br> 

<p>
<i>((That seems like a good place to end the discussion.
I hope people weren't too bored reading this.... Go Gonzaga!
Go UCLA!  Go Big East!  Yes, East and West.... my last second
new dreams would be UCLA and Gonzaga from the West and Midwest
regions, the West Coast teams in the west; and Big East teams
in the East and South (Seton Hall and Miami!  Our awful PC
Friar team beat both of them down the stretch.... I also
will be rooting for Tulsa and Florida.) ))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>I have no regular Diplomacy game openings, but am actively recruiting
players for Mark Kinney so he can get his szine restarted.
To assist him, I have agreed to join his game.  
See the note in the Dip Hobby section above.

<p>
Also, from Eric Ozog:
``What do you say to me running Bernie Oaklyn's Air-Sea Diplomacy variant
as a subzine in <i>TAP</i>? The Maricopa game is going to wind up pretty soon,
and I'd still like to GM. I fit the profile: I'm a `not as young as I
used to be somewhat old-timer burned-out dip-deadwood daddy,' so GMing a
single game (preferably variant) in an orphanage zine (like <i>TAP</i>) of HOFs
(Hobby Old Farts) seems to be the fashionable thing to do these days.  It
might help forestall alzheimer's, if anything.  If you remember, Air-Sea
is the variant Uncle Bernie designed, based on the standard map except it
adds airplanes and submarines.  Maybe even Bernie would play.  I just
need to clean up the rules a little bit and would like to run it as an
email game, and you can print it in your zine.  You can make the
announcement in the next issue of <i>TAP</i> if you'd like, and shortly I'll
edit the rules and send them to you for publication.  What do you think?''
GO FOR IT, ERIC.
You know that as one of my originals, you only have to ask.
Send requests to join this game either to me or to Eric.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has taken the sixth spot.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this very soon,
we now need only TWO more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is the first one to sign up (so say I).
We will play with four players, so I need three more.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming.

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.  
If you are interested, contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note the following from Buddy: ``I will be off line from early evening, 
Tuesday, 21 March, until mid morning, Thursday, 30 March.  
Please arrange deadlines to give me a day or so for diplomacy.''
No retreats, so April 1st is just a press season.
Fall moves aren't due until the 22nd.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-ENGLAND): No offense in the mao just a protective maneuver.

<p>
(PARIS FEB 28, 1902): The British 
Ambassador, upon his return to Paris immediately requested and was 
granted a meeting with the President of France, ``Monsieur le President, 
my return will be very brief as, in this winter of discontent, I must 
inform you that a state of war now exists between our two nations." 
 
<p>
(IN THE BAY OF BISCAY MAR 1, 1902): 2nd Sea Lord Fisher, in command 
of the fleet, spoke to Captain Hood, ``I expect you to lead the assault 
on Brest. Also included in your orders is a letter of marque signed by 
his Majesty King George V  for the purpose of privateering. If you can 
capture any French shipping then so much the better for your career." 
  
<p>
(OFF USHANT ISLAND, BRITTANY MAR 5, 1902): Captain Hood could see 
no sign of French shipping through the periscope of HMS Kipper. Perhaps, 
he thought, a surprise attack on Brest harbour was possible.That 
evening, fancying himself a `privateer of old' he shouted  orders to his 
crew, ``Blow the ballast, ready torpedoes, full speed ahead, steer due 
east helmsman. Let us give `Frenchie' some `tunnyfish'!"

<p>
(I to EVERYONE): Ok, EVERYONE except France wants me to hit France.  Everyone
wants me to fight most anyone but Austria.  Well, most everyone, there is at
least one who says I do what I want there and they won't be miffed.
Everyone but Russia wants me to air drop on Russia.  No one liked my last
set of moves, including me.  So dots are gold here folks, ideas???  

<p>
(DOWN AT THE BARROOM WITH SHREEVY):
It was one of those really good nights at the Doo Drop
Inn. Crazy Henry was arguing politics with Billy the
Creep and Shreve was in fine, if tipsy form. He was
chuckling about some threats that had come from some
young fellow named Sean.

<p>
``Ya gotta figure that these boy wonders ain't going to
amount to much, unlessen someone is stupid and goes
along with them," said he, employing a long quaff of
beer for emphasis. 

<p>
``Me, I figure this Sean guy oughta get into some kind
of remediationalist class. The kid ain't exactly
stupid. Maybe he could amount to something some day."

<p>
Right then, the conversation went over to the merits
of women's beach volleyball (should they be more
scantily clad, and wasn't their game more exciting
than basketball, no matter what the women did?) 

<p>
Actually, it was a rather quiet evening. Hopefully,
there will be more to report next time.
 
<p>
(VIENNA-GENTLEMEN): Let me talk about something other than the game for a
moment. If you know anyone, or perhaps you yourself is planning to travel
to Guatemala. FORGET IT! The bandits have taken over the highways in that
country and the buses and trains are being robbed EVERY day. They are
arresting hundreds and it doesn't seem to be stopping the out of control
situation hitting that country. They are packing in over fifty in cells
meant to hold two, and still they come. Just recently a bus full of college
students from the states was stopped and robbed, the girls were raped and
two of the guys were shot. Plus they lost everything.
Be careful and DON'T go to Guatemala.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that Bob Acheson has moved to a new apartment in the same 
building.

<p>
2) We have six retreats, by my count, and some more fancy adjudicating.
We'll see if I got everything right.
Remember that if I make a mistake in Spring, you NEED to alert me to
it by the Summer deadline.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SPAIN - OTTO): Hope my letter got there in time.

<p>
(SPAIN - NETH): Welcome aboard.

<p>
(SPAIN - FRANCE): I thought we already discussed this. Go Home!

<p>
(BOOB to COLONIA'S): Kinda quiet on the press, but I know it takes
a lot of effort just to follow all these units around.
The Spring/Fall map appears again.
I know this is helpful to me for getting a sense of the big picture,
but I don't ``set up'' the game like most of you probably do.
I adjudicate using the large blank map and just entering the orders.
Probably not a wise idea, but that's the way I GM.
Doing the paper map is my last check, note that I missed the Russian
move from Caucasus to Armenia the first time around and thought that
the Ottoman's got in, but doing the map made the correction obvious.

Note the additions above.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WINTER AS RUSSIA): Build one dirigible and two snowballs, plus one extra
nuclear device to take to Turkey.
<i>((Fails, impossible.))</i>

<p>
(SARA-GM): I received a letter from John Schultz today (10 March) and he 
wrote ``F112" on the envelope in place of ``D331".    
<i>((Thanks, same here, see changed address above.))</i>

<p>
(SARA REICHERT-ALL): For some reason, the GM keeps re-printing my 
no-longer-used-or-available e-mail address with NetZero.  For the third time, 
let me inform everyone that I am now at sarareichert of aol.com
<i>((Sorry about that, it's OK now.))</i>

<p>
(SARA-GM): I note your problems and interests in new game starts.   For what 
it may be worth, I most certainly would like another game of OUTPOST, either 
in your szine or in one of the sub-szines.   I am starting my first OUTPOST 
game in Mike Lowrey's zine.  I am on the waitlist for OUTPOST games in 
KeithThomasson's and Chris Hassler's zines.   What is my fascination with 
this game?   It is about SHOPPING!   The game is mostly a matter of deciding 
what to buy, and when, and for how much.   Any other questions?
<i>((I don't think I am interested in running the game, but I'll watch
it in Lowrey's and Thomasson's szines and see what I think of it.
I am NOT really looking for more games to run myself, but don't mind
supporting guest GMs or other szines that want to start.))</i>

<p>
(SARA-JOHN HARRINGTON): I MIGHT  be interested in seeing a copy of the rules 
for OFFICE POLITICS.  However, I cannot make an actual commitment to play at 
this time.  For one thing, I am sure that a nice woman like me would know 
little about such things as ``empire building, negotiations, double-dealing, 
backstabbing, and perfidy"  And if you did run the game, I'd prefer that it 
would have deadlines every other issue of <i>TAP</i>, as <i>TINAMOU</i> does.

NOT ALL THE WAY JUST YET!

Command in zis strong,highly motivated group as an Advisor.You vould receive 
the rank as Herr.General and all of za privileges and Honors that go along 
vith it.........Your reputation as a fighting man and your courage as a 
leader has no equal...I look forward to hearing from you.....

<p>
(FANTASTIC VOYAGE TURKEY to AUSTRIA AND ITALY): Get him all the way, boys, all
the way...

<p>
(FRANCE to ALL): Scott, I have recieved your psychic transmission. I know that despite 
any ``spoken" allaince we are still on the same page. I have felt the vibes 
from the East and West.  We have lots to discuss, regarding our beer drinking 
neighbors.  Please send clearer psychic transmissions for the Spring moves.  
Builds are easy to get the crystal ball to materialize but moves are tougher. 
 If you get garbled transmissions we may have to actually call each other or 
send a mail.  

<p>
(ADMIRAL PAUL VON SHERRHODT to THE PALACE OF LIGHT AND GLORY):
I was hoping to avoid hostilities.  Ooops!!! 
Your reply came too late...I assure 
you that the remains of the Dead shall be put to rest.(Not much left after 
the Wolves and Ravens had their way.)To make it all proper,my Government has 
invited the Pope himself to bless the Battlefield and bones of all who have 
fallen....Perhaps they at least will find Peace at last...

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Mark Kinney will end up getting a retreat and at least one more
move, but it isn't looking good....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(KURT OZOG): BTW, your favorite band has a new album out. Illinois
Entertainer reviewed it this month and gave it a 6 on
a scale of 10. I just may have to see their show
again. 
<i>((I gotta track it down myself.))</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): I know that I have announced your demise several times,
but this time I think it is about to be for keeps.  

<p>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA): No, not quite yet.  Maybe I'm embarrassed here, but I
am betting not.

<p>
(BOOB to ENGLAND AND GERMANY): Huh??

<p>
(ENGLAND to TURKEY): Hang in there.  You never know.  If the worst comes to
pass, our government would be happy to host your government in exile.

<p>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA): Well, ok, let's just see what happens.

<p>
(BOOB to ENGLAND AND GERMANY AGAIN): OK....

<p>
(GERMANY to ITALY): I've looked over all my correspondence in this game and I
still can't find it.  What season was it supposed to happen?

<p>
(BOOB to GERMANY): Look, if YOU can't keep all these things straight,
don't expect ME to do it for you.

<p>
(GOZ to SGIH): I'm running for Commissioner of MLB.  Write your favorite
team's Owner and tell him to vote for me.  Hurry before the Yankees win it
again.
<i>((The Yankees are goin' down.
Watch out for my Red Sox!))</i>

<p>
(JAMES to WORLD): SU finished the regular season at 24-4, not too shabby.  I
bet they will still be alive in the NCAAs when you read this - and not just
because of the quick <i>TAP</i> turnaround.  The only problem is there are no
worthwhile sports until next fall once the NCAAs are over.
<i>((Ooooh, not a baseball fan, eh??
Well, see the discussion between me and Rick Desper elsewhere, but you
are correct, sir.
Syracuse IS alive.
I honestly thought that Jason Hart would continue his late-season funk, 
but he has awakened and Syracuse will go as far as he carries them.))</i>

<p>
(JAMES to GM): I saw that New Zealand retained the America's Cup.  I watched
some of the matches on ESPN.  I have known several sailors who have been
involved with Dennis Conner in previous Cups and met him about 15 years ago
prior to the '83 campaign so I have always been interested in the America's
Cup event.  Too bad the Americans couldn't get their act together and
combine resources this year.  We had too many syndicates poorly organized
and funded.  Hopefully we learned our lesson.  Do the people in Rhode Island
still follow the Cup or is it a non-event since it left Newport?
<i>((Absolutely!
The Young America campaign was the one that was followed the closest
around here (most Rhode Islanders in it and the one that would have
brought the race back to Newport).
Quite frankly, Dennis Conner is not real popular around here for a 
number of reasons, the selfish one is that he started the trend to
pull the America's Cup away from Newport.
As we speak, it looks like the next challenge will not include ANY
US team which would bring the match back here.
I absolutely agree with you on the problem and I think it is likely
we will condense to two, or at most three, syndicates in 2003, but
the massive interest around here will slowly erode if we don't have
a part in it.
Parochial yes, but also truthful.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) It looks like everyone is getting ready to attack the first Sprint line.
Isaac has the inside track to get the first.
How will everyone else line up next time?
31 looks like a hot number..... 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MANIACS to GM): Yuck!  First missed the rule change, then missed the boat!
<i>((Don't cry for me, Argentina....))</i>

<p>
(WHITE RABBIT): I'm late, look at the time, oh my goodness, I'm late, I'm
late ...

<p>
(MARK-BOOB):  I'm no triskadeliphobe.  I don't have time for that nonsense!

<p>
(BOOB-MARK): Your choice, but it looked pretty unlucky to you
until Mad Hatter played low and kept you connected to the pack.
Still, your 15 has you way behind some other 15's.
The ALICE team picked up four 15's in all!

<p>
(FIELD to DESIGNER): Looks like a nice pack coming up at 26-29 next time.

<p>
(BUHRT - MAD HATTER): It ain't the crowdin ya need to watch out fur, its
what they make out of hay that makes the track slippery.

<p>
(OTHERS to AMATEURS): You're doing all too well for a first-timer, we think.

<p>
(ERIC-HARRY):  Have you ever noticed the service guarantee on the Post
Office's Priority Mail?  They promise it will probably get there in two days. 
That's going out on a limb!

<p>
(MATTHEW-HATTER):  To say nothing of the smell<font face=symbol>�</font
>

<p>
(MAD HATTER - MARCH HARE): A very happy un-birthday to you!

<p>
(REST-TFWS): Being a nice guy earns our eternal admiration.

<p>
(MOCK TURTLE - TFWS): Nice guys come last.

<p>
(TFWS -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BOOB): I have the most uncanny ability to find the
gap in the line.
It's like reverse clairvoyance or something.
<i>((Well, you didn't score REALLY well this time, but at least
you made ``safe in the pack'' scores.))</i>

<p>
(MANIACS to ALICE): As you can see from my performance here so far, it's
no surprise I didn't notice you were here.  I think I'd being doing 
better running actually.

<p>
(MARCH HARE - MAD HATTER): Maybe they'll trip over each other.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-GM): ``CUISUS TESTICULOS HABEAS, HABEAS CARDIA ET 
CEREBELLUM"   Polite translation:  ``When you have their full attention in your 
grip, their hearts and minds will follow".

<p>
(CHEF - BRIT): Hey, I got the game in the mail.  Thanks!  

<p>
(CHEF - FIELD): I'll bring the bike race game to Balmer in August, most likely.
Unless I decide to skip WDC this year and spend the time wandering in
the Alps instead.  Since my next job is in the DC area, I will most
likely go.

<p>
(CHEF - MAD HATTER):  Too much mercury, eh?  Modern psychiatry could do
wonders for your condition. 

<p>
(JOHN HARRINGTON to GM):
I have finally sent a copy of Breaking Away to Rick Desper.  I hope he enjoys 
it.  Ironic in a way that I was hoping to get more Americans interested in 
this type of game and it goes to someone living in Germany, the world capital 
of good board games.

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Here's to a band that deals in the
facts of life; in their ten short ugly years <i>((written in 1987))</i>
I wish the Mekons good fortune; I sold them fame and riches and good health.''
From ``Sympathy for the Mekons'' off of <i>Honky Tonkin'</i>.

<p>
(TO THE MEKONS): It never ceases to amaze me how Europeans think they 
are so enlightened and superior to Americans in general.
<i>((In my view, this usually is for two reasons, one is the reason
we are discussing here, the other (which actually has more credence to me)
is the selfishness of Americans regarding the existence of rest of the world,
epitomized in this presidential election by George W. Bush's lack
of interest and knowledge in anything happening anywhere else in the 
world.  Your average European knows ten times as much about politics
and current events in other countries.
I will shortly be writing about this more elsewhere.))</i>
I'm not disagreeing with the facts as presented, but I'm wondering
why, when comparing Europe to the US in terms of violence,
the ethnic cleansing civil strife in Eastern Europe doesn't count.
<i>((It does count, but we tend to be a day late and a dollar short
in dealing with things like this and the Europeans have to wait for us,
given the world geopolitical situation.))</i>
If you can ignore civil violence and religious strife that has been 
raging in some areas for hundreds of years, I'll ignore the violence
that more often than not occurs in our inner cities.
PS Does Hitler murdering 25 million people count?

<p>
(RICK - ALL): actually, the Modern homepage has moved.  New address:

but enough of the vagueness, please!

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): May I have Mor???

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): Sorry guy, I already made a deal with Britain 
moments before you attacked and I am a man of my word.

<p>
(VOICE OF THE GREATER REICH): We should have nice, tidy new fronts here
while we see what the untermensch are up to.

<p>
1) An FRT draw is proposed.
Please vote with your Winter orders.
Eric Cartman already is recorded as voting YES.
Oh, yes, there also is a call for a concession to Chef.
Cartman votes yes to that one too.
Failure to vote vetoes the proposals

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(KENNY IN PEKING UNDER ATTACK BY JAPANESE DIVISIONS):
(SPLAT!)
Stan - ``Oh my
God!
They've killed Kenny! You bastards!''

<p>
(ON BOARD THE DUTCH BATTLESHIP LINDHOOVEN): During a spell of rough
seas last night, Captain O'Toole (the only Irish officer in the Dutch
fleet) fell on his head.  He is now convinced that he is
T.E. Lawrence, uniter of the Arabian peninsula!

<p>
``To arms, men, to arms!  We shall rally the British to fight the
Russian enemy.  To the Red Sea, and beyond!  Let the Turks join our
cause as we march on Moscow."

<p>
Sarcastic Charlie, the wry first mate, comments, ``Gee, you're supposed
to be Lawrence of Arabia, and you want the Turks to <i>join</i> you?
Wasn't the whole film about fighting <i>against</i> the Turks?  And when
did the Russians get involved?  And how did an Irishman get in charge
of a Dutch ship in the first place?"

<p>
Poor Charlie was immediately tossed overboard.  

<p>
(HOLLAND - FRANCE): Thanks for the South Park press last time.  I
missed an issue.

<p>
(T to R): You heard from the Toady Ghoddess?

<p>
(ODESSA to SAIGON): I'll do my best, but it may be too little, too late. 
Hope you keep running amok in India, though ... who knows, Gandhi may be
a Francophile.

<p>
(T to R): You heard from Williams?  Me neither.

<p>
(TOAD to BOARD): Can't we all just be friends???  

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN to TURKISH TALLMAN): Hey!  If Russia asks you to take
some dots, go ahead!  Build another army.  You'll be popular.  All the
other kids will like you.
<i>((He's so impressed, he refused to move either of us units....))</i>

<p>
(F GOA - F RED): CHARGE!

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN - GM): I vote `yes' on every draw proposed this time.
For next time, I propose a concession to Chef.  Not Holland, but Chef
himself.  

<p>
(CHEF - PLAYERS OF SMTM): If you concede to me, I'll sing you a groovy
tune.

<p>
(ERIC CARTMAN - GM): Oh, I also propose a concession to the talented
Mr. Ripley.  That movie was schwee.  But why did Ripley ignore Gwyneth
while trying to get into a bathtub with Jude Law?
<i>((Beats the hell out of me, literally!))</i>

<p>
(KENNY - ERIC): Mmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm

<p>
(BIG GAY AL - KENNY): Little boy, ``pillow biter" is not a very nice
phrase to use.  

<p>
(BIG GAY AL - GM):
Can you believe that some people still don't think
that the Ripley character was gay?  Did we see the same film?
<i>((I don't know what movie they saw.
Maybe they really were watching ``Stuart Little'' and got confused.))</i>

<p>
(STAN - GM) I think the NBA should concede that they don't have any
players have as interesting as Michael Jordan.  Rather than trying to
turn every Kobe Bryant or Vince Carter into ``the next Jordan", they
should just let the game be for a while.  It's insulting to all the
players like Kareem, Bird, Magic, Dr. J., Bill Russell, etc.  Also,
Bill Bradley should just concede already.  (Probably has done so
already by the time this goes to press.)

<p>
(KYLE - GM): I think the Academy of Motion Pictures should concede
that they were on crack when they nominated ``The Sixth Sense" for Best
Picture over ``Three Kings".  ``Three Kings" was easily the second-best
picture of the year, following, naturally, ``Bigger, Longer, and
Uncut". Too bad we only got nominated for Best Song.  And now they
want to censor it!  Just 'cause we talk about ``that bitch Anne
Murray". She thought it was funny!  Look at
``http://www.allladvantage.co.uk/south/4.htm" for details.  It's silly!
Our movie is about fighting censorship, but the Oscars people want the
lyrics changed or it won't be part of the broadcast!
<i>((Yeah, what nonsense.
I really, really liked your movie!))</i>

<p>
(BIG GAY AL - GM): Oh dear me, California has just outlawed Gay
Marriages!  Guess it's ok for gold-diggers to marry rich a**holes they
just met on TV as part of a FOX promotion, but heaven forbid two
loving lifelong partners should want the same tax protections!  
Any pair of mentally deranged twits are allowed to marry, as long as
it's one man and one woman.  All in the name of ``Christian values".
And I thought we had a separation between Church and State in the
U.S.!  The more this erodes, the worse it is for the country!

<p>
(KYLE - AL): Just think: what would Brian Boitano do?
