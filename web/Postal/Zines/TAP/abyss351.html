This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Let's get the new Diplomacy game going.
Since Doug may be winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

smoked at World DipCon (see:

<i>((If anyone from <i>TAP</i> or <i>ES</i> has ideas 
for more things to talk about here let me know.
I do have five or six ideas lined up here already that I just have to write.
The Ossipee Valley Music Festival back in July was lots of fun
again, I don't think they make a lot of money, so I worry about 
their longevity, but I love their Maine small festival feel http://www.ossipeevalley.com/.
I took my 6 year old grandson Noah to the Sunday festival this year, 
along with my brother-in-law.
Noah has a ukulele and is learning piano already and had fun until he reached
the end of his patience factor.
There were predictions of thunderstorms as we sat down in front of the main
stage to hear husband and wife team Carrie Elkin and Danny Schmidt sing and play.
Danny played the song that he originally sung to Carrie to woo her, but she
missed the point and didn't get what he was doing.
Most of the time they apparently tour separately, but they were just brilliant
together, Texas based singer songwriters who both speak from the heart.
They finished up by singing "Amazing Grace" gorgeously as they celebrated that
the rain had held off.  They stopped singing and the skies opened up.  
We backed up under the tent at the back of the Maine Stage area just in time.
They then moved the rest of the show into the Dance Barn.
We all tromped in as the Maine Songwriter's Showcase was just finishing up
and that songwriter (who also was really good!) got a boost in audience.
It took a while to set up for The Stray Birds, a rootsy band from Pennsylvania.
Noah was particularly interested in the standup bass and the standup bass player. 
And as we were admiring it, it so happened that 
we were standing next to the bass player's parents,
so we struck up a conversation.
They had traveled from Pennsylvania to see their son. 
Then they were ready to play so we sat back down, and as the rain poured down 
outside the open barn, The Stray Birds enticed us with brilliant harmonies
featuring songs from their new album coming out in October.
These singers and multi-instrumentalists were incredibly talented in their 
mix of folk and bluegrass influences. 
I'm definitely getting their new record and maybe the last one (that has some
amazing reviews).
Each of their songs was mesmerizing with really tight acoustic arrangements.
And the rain beating down added to the atmosphere.
Finally, the last band that day, I'm really sorry my wife Charlotte hadn't 
come along, she would have loved them.
The Lonely Heartstring Band obviously had some great picking, some classically
trained musicians, and a bit of Beatles mixed in.
They really grabbed me, but finally, about half way through their set, Noah
had had enough.  
He turns seven in a few weeks, but he was awfully young to hang with this
entire event.
I'm sure this is something he will remember.
His sister Emily was practicing her pie baking, as she is entering the Fryeburg
Fair competition at the end of September...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
And then I could have soloed the second game, but well, I can't exactly 
say how I did it, but the Canadian player soloed there, with help from me.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals SHOULD start 
in September any day now.
But you still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The DIAS game ending proposal failed.
New draw proposals, to vote with your Winter orders are:
DIAS, EF, EFR, and concession to E. 
If more than one proposal passes, the SMALLEST one that passes goes.
If you fail to vote, you veto any proposal you do not vote on.
Methinks there are changes afoot, but that's up to you all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Send all good thoughts to Heath Gardner, who still has just been having a terrible
time on all fronts.
I think he thinks he is beginning to see a way out, though.
So let's hope that is a way out.
Thanks to Doug Kent for stepping in for the game position.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Wow, no one replenished above a total of 17, and two of you had the minimum
replenishment of 12.  When will the pack reform, or will it?
Remember that the next Sprint Line is at 80 (getting to 81 to score).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to RIDERS): You CAN write press, you know, even if it is to yell at Rick
as he pedals out of sight.

Kendo Nagasaki games in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> 
continue to multiply like weeds...
I'd like to get more people engaged here, not just the usual suspects from Doug's games.
The full rules for Where in the World is Kendo Nagasaki are
in: http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/es58.pdf.
The player who was closest for Turn 6 has been notified by E-Mail.
Note that the official rules say you're supposed to get this by TURN 10,
time to get a bit closer on WHO Kendo is.

much dead, while I am very much alive.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
A short last word this time since I have to postal mail some orders to John Boardman
for that game that I'm in, and E-Mail orders to Doug for his szine.
We still are hoping that Doug finds some motivation, I think it's about him
wanting to get his book published, so anyone who can help him or offer advice on that
should talk to him.

And also, on August 29th, I'll be lamenting that Don never reached his 57th birthday,
join me in doing so.</b>
