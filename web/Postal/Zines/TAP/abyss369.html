<br /><br />The Diplomacy tournament at TotalCon
in Mansfield, MA February 19-21 is coming right up!
It's not too late!! 
Y'all should come!!!
The new Kendo Nagasaki game keeps going, I like running them and
I also like playing in them... mostly.  Plenty of time to join still.
The two new games also are off to flying starts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My health update is a bit of up and a bit of down.  I've knocked back
some significant side effects, but am still on chemo trying to stay ahead
of any cancer comebacks.  As they say these days, cancer is more and more
of a chronic disease, my experience has still been much better than others
with similar cancers.  Our pal Mark Fassio is hanging in there with his 
greater issues than mine.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i> in
<i>NSWG</i> #16, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  
Since Terry's passing, we lose our thirty year fervent hope that someday <i>NSWG</i>
would have been resurrected and I could go back and swear my fealty to the Toadfather.
The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved yet again.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are still in charge. 
There were a few glitches and broken links, but things should be fixed now, if you
have problems, let us know!
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
The address is still:
/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the current list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
I'm trying to add some of the newer subscribers who aren't there.  
If you have questions or problems, PLEASE ask.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, we'll see if that helps.
Please let me know.

<i>((For upcoming cons around the world: /Face/cons/index.php, 
success, we have badgered all the Con directors to post their Cons, so it is reasonably
up to date now.
And there remains lots of interest in the FTF community, and linking E-Mail/Web players
to FTF.  
Now is the time I'm ramping up the slight deviation adjustment in running my February 
Diplomacy tournament, leadoff to the Nor'Easter.
Since TempleCon moved itself to August, great for them horrible for me, I've cut the tie
of... what ten years running Diplomacy there?
Robert Rousse and others had been hoping for some time that I'd move over to TotalCon, 
which actually has WAY more boardgamers and is a bit later in February, this year
February 19-21, just up the road in Mansfield, MA, halfway between Providence and 
Boston.  This also is a plus for our Boston gamers and for the Vermonters coming down
it's closer too.  You might still prefer to fly into Providence's airport, but as noted
it's equidistant between there and Logan Airport in Boston.
We can work out pickups and such.
I still have two hotel rooms reserved down the street at the Red Roof Inn, that are
pay what you want/can, as usual, with lots of space there still available for last
minute deciders,
http://www.totalcon.com has more particulars.
Contact me for more details if you're coming.
Also, the Facebook page for European Tournament Diplomacy, https://www.facebook.com/groups/1500292310187264/,
Diplomacy in Europe, has been really active and the place to be in the hobby these days.
If you're on Facebook, hook up there!))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Welcome to the new game start.  My house rules appear most recently in Issue #343:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/TAP343.pdf.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 I need to say that my attitude toward
house rules has evolved since being part of Thaddeus Black's current project to 
codify the rules for the game of Diplomacy.  When that is done, I will do another 
version of my House Rules acknowledging this project, but for now, assume that
when I refer to being held to "current standard hobby practice" it is represented
by the evolving consensus of that project: Diplomacy Player's Technical Guide, 
2nd Edition.  You may feel free to communicate more about this to our Austrian
player, who leads this project.  Italicised moves fail of execution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I tried to add everyone to the TAP mailing list, please join it with preferred settings
and E-Mail address, see instructions on Page 1.
Let me know if you have problems.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Write press for publication with results.  It's fun.  I know most people don't
do much of it any more, but you will earn the eternal respect of the GM if you do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) According to TAP tradition, we offer an opportunity for a Press Only Summer 1901
season, but many of you may want to press on to Fall 1901, that's up to all of you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Oh, and one last point for our "new <i>TAP</i> players", yes I adjudicate all 
games by hand and do the maps by hand.  You do need to check me, but hand adjudication
IS the only way to GM... ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY): Attack Germany, she will fight back, make neutral moves Germany will reply in kind, 
make pro-German moves and you have a friend.

(TEAM AUSTRIA-THE WORLD): "Who is for a mutual non-aggression pact?  No barging, clashing of wheels or cutting each other up..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We do have seven players.  My intent it to play to the rules, with the overcrowding rule used only on the first turn.
I recognize that some large replenishment cards after that are possible, but we'll go with it and see how it plays.
