<br /><br />My interesting new news this month is that after a group meetings of all my 
doctors they all decided that I really had/have Stage IV Colon Cancer and
this is where the cancer statted.  That's part of the reason that the
colon cancer focused chemotherapy I got worked so well.  And in the 
colonoscopy I had a while back they found what they decided was the
original site.
But the continuing good news is that all of that is clear of cancer
right now and not finding that site until now probably helped to
save me from surgery, which definitely is a good thing.
Wish me luck on getting rid of the remaining array of sideeffects.
I'm having acupuncture to work on the hands/feet neuropathy, 
which is working... slowly.
The new Kendo Nagasaki game keeps going, I like running them and
I also like playing in them... mostly.  Plenty of time to join still.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That all should keep the szine cranking and I'd like to start another regular
Diplomacy game in addition to the Breaking Away that's getting close to six!
Wishing all the rest of you who are struggling with 
health issues similar good news!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
The address is still:
http://diplom.org/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the new list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link

Now is the time I'm ramping up the slight deviation adjustment in running my February 
Diplomacy tournament, leadoff to the Nor'Easter.
Since TempleCon moved itself to August, great for them horrible for me, I've cut the tie
of... what ten years running Diplomacy there?
Robert Rousse and others had been hoping for some time that I'd move over to TotalCOn, 
which actually has WAY more boardgamers and is a bit later in February, this year
February 19-21, just up the road in Mansfield, MA, halfway between Providence and 
Boston.  This also is a plus for our Boston gamers and for the Vermonters coming down
it's closer too.  You might still prefer to fly into Providence's airport, but as noted
it's equidistant between there and Logan Airport in Boston.
We can work out pickups and such.
I also have two hotel rooms reserved down the street at the Red Roof Inn, that are
pay what you want/can, as usual,
http://www.totalcon.com has more particulars.
I know I'm celebrating getting to do this again, come join me!!!

<b>Richard Weiss (Tue, Nov 10, 2015 at 1:41 AM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim;
Some time last century, you mentioned Richard Thompson.  I bought a CD, then another.  
I've seen him 2-3 times over the decades.  Last night I saw him with at the Crest Theater in Sacramento, 
probably 1400 seat venue.  I was in the front row, aisle stage left.  There was an opening 
act for the Richard Thompson electric trio.  Was him acoustic and solo.  That was great.  Maybe 30+ minutes. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The theater is supposedly deco, but not.  Dreary colors, scary and sad carvings, serpents 
and a very bad place to trip.  Sound old fashioned with speakers on the stage and not much else, 
so loud and slightly lopsided for me.  He stood to stage right, whether solo or trio.  
For trio drummer behind him and bass closer to me.  It took me a while but electric 
was great rock/folk/jazz.  Drummer was great.  All were great.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the acoustic I guess I shouted some encouragement and girl friend hushed me.  
For electric I chair danced with the drummer, she got into it, and chair danced and 
maybe 100 minutes with two encores consisting of 5 or 6 songs.  
I knew he had looked over at me about 4 times during the acoustic.  
My eyes were frequently closed while chair dance drumming, but I opened my eyes to see him 
looking at me a couple of times.  At the end of his finale encore, he looked at me, 
tilted his head and body a little and pointed/held out his hand to me.  Cool.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thank you,

<i>((Way cool. 
As I've described before my closest real moment (having seen Richard Thompson about a 
dozen times over the years) was the famous Richard and Linda Thompson breakup tour.
At Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, it was a standup bar setting, but I was right in front
of Richard in the crowd about two or three people back from the stage.  The icy
personal situation filled the room even as the music took us through the stunning
depths of the "Shoot Out the Lights" album.  As I've also described before, my
closest situation to what happened to you was the night the Mekons grabbed me up
on stage for the whole encore after I screamed (probably sounded to them louder
than I realized) "Fear and Whiskey" at them.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((In most ways, I prefer watching Richard Thompson by himself acoustic, he's
just worked out such great ways of playing so many of his best songs that way.
I've talked about this before, but I hope you do have his "Acoustic Classics"
record from last year.
It features 14 of his songs, the last time I saw him live he did most of them.
To me, the two songs that bookend what he accomplished here are the version
of "Shoot Out the Lights", of which I have at least two other versions, but 
now this one is my favorite.  This really is a rocking song, done in an acoustic
way that grabs you even more on its famous hesitations.
Then "From Galway to Graceland" is one of those weird Thompson story songs
about a middle-aged woman and her love for Elvis Presley!
It's much more of a rollicking Irish tune though.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I thought your comments on how you tried to get into the music but had your
girlfriend hush you is somewhat close to what happens when I've taken Charlotte
to Richard Thompson concerts with me.
I remember at least two of these, one at Brown University at least 20 years ago,
and the other more recently on this "Acoustic Classics" tour where I saw him
up in Maine.
I do find it interesting that I've never really found a band as a great date
night, and I listen to music most in my car rides, since I usually spend at
least 15 hours a week in the car - part of my thinking time and listening time.))</i>

This Diplomacy Variant is a way to play a game when a full slate of players is not possible. 
This Variant is also a way to help new players learn the game because it a simple variant 
which gives each new player a crack at playing more than one Country. Every two years players 
trade countries by moving two countries along the control bar from left to right. (See Y6) 
Countries which do not have a player at the end of this process are controlled by the games neutral player. 
Optional: The Engineer Diplomacy CD rules can be used by the players to bid for neutral country unit moves. 
Players can trade countries one year before the two year deadline arrives. The game uses an 
accumulated point system to determine the game winner(s). Betting a bottle of beer for each 
player point spread is not encouraged! 
"If your country is eliminated while you are its player," 
"you are sitting on the short chair and are out of game."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Players still in the Game add up their every two Year Switch Points, if one player has 
at least two more points than any other when the game ends, then he has a solo win! 
Otherwise Draws are given to Highest Point Players within three 3 points of 
highest score. Points at each even year are determined by Country and player, 
one 1 point for no SC count change over two year period, minus one <font face="symbol">-</font
>1 point for 
each SC less than the number the County had when you took over, plus one +1 
point for each SC gained greater than the number the County had when you took over!

Objective is to use diplomacy and strewed moves to avoid moving into that one 
or two SC country in the second year. Players can do one on one trade for country 
they must move to, one year prior to required move, but not in year move will be 
required. If you are one Chair short in the next even year then the Trade is canceled. 
The trade agreed to, happens before the bar is used to change ones country for another 
Country. If a player on the bar would have gotten one of the traded countries that 
player moves along the bar to next country. A traded for country once acquired is 
your new position on the control bar for the next two year country jump.

You go along the bar from the first occurrence of your Country's initial to find your 
new Country. If another player has already used the Bar you hunt for your 
initial after his acquired country initial. You then move along bar two places 
away from your starting Initial. If that initial is not an out of 
Game Country or traded Country or an already claimed Country then this 
is your new Country; otherwise move one country along bar till unused 
initial is found! After all Players have a new country, left over 
Countries become Neutral Countries! (See Y6.00 Country movement control bar)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Optional Rule!" Neutral Countries in this game are considered to be `NMR' Countries. 
You can mortgage one of your Country's unit moves to bid for a possible 
Neutral Country Unit move. The 1971 Rule Book for Diplomacy clause XIV3 CIVIL DISORDER states:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"If a player leaves the game, or fails to submit orders in a given Spring or Fall season... 
His units hold in position, but do not support one another." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The above situation is often referred to by Game Masters as `No Moves Received' or in the abbreviated form `NMR'.

Y5.10 Solution for biding wars</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1/ For each Area with a Unit in Civil Disorder, the number of exactly the same orders for the unit, 
gives a bid value for that order.    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2/ The largest bid value is used to eliminate all order bids the same or smaller than the largest bid.    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3/ After 2 has been done for each CD Area, any bids which are left are the winning bids and their 
sponsoring units are in CD for that season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The proper Form for a Civil Disorder Bid is:  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[CD existing unit location (Move required for Unit in Civil Disorder)]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ordered Units in Fall or Spring:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
RU: F StP - Nor, A Mos - Sil

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AH: A Vie - Tri

<div class="p"><!----></div>
IT: F Ion S A Nap, A Nap H

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Turkey's lone unit in Civil Disorder:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
TU: F Bla

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Civil Disorder Bids:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Russia:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CD StP (F Bla-Ank)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CD MOS (F Bla-Ank)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Austria:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CD vie (F Bla-Ank)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Italy:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CD Ion (F Bla-Sev)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CD Nap (F Bla-Sev)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The result is 3 Bids for (F Bla-Ank) and 2 for (F Bla-Sev); so (F Bla-Ank) would happen 
and mortgaged units StP, Mos, Vie would be ordered to Hold while units Ion and Nap would 
execute their original orders. If Austria did not submit a CD order then it would be 
2 and 2, so all units would execute there original orders and F Bla would be unordered.

Y5.20 The need for Civil Disorder moves!</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why move Units in Civil Disorder? After a game goes beyond year one finding 
Player replacements can be a pain. Why should a player dropping out cause undo 
delay or stop a game from continuing with its original players? 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Often in later stages of a game, a Player will stop sending in orders because 
he can not see a way to win or has lost interest in the game. This can cause an 
allied player to lose a winnable game, CD orders give him a fighting chance.    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With Civil Disorder moves NMR positions become a mediated hazard of the game. 
Jockeying for Control of these units then becomes part of the game's power structure.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The AEF draw is rejected, we go to Fall. A Concession to England is proposed for Fall,
vote with your orders and if anyone fails to vote (including Doug), it vetoes the concession.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) With the game going on, we need a standby, so I'm appointing Paul Rauterberg.
Thanks, Paul, you might only need to come in for one season.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
So there were attacks in Paris and Mali in the last month, and then one that is threatened
in Brussels as we write!
Many of us Diplomacy players followed the tournament that was on-going in Paris while the
attack progressed, including many players visiting from around the world.
Though they did not play on Friday the 13th, that evening, they did complete the rest
of the tournament.  Many of us communicated with the attendees via social media
and in the new "we are the World" environment, this put a visible face on the 
horrible crisis for me and others in the Diplomacy hobby family.
The French National Diplomacy Champion went to a well-deserved Emmanuel
du Pontavice!  
Tom Haver was one of the Americans there and won Best Italy and finished fourth.
This was part of a sequence of European tournaments where Phil Weissert (who has
been to my tournament in Providence!!!) won the Dutch National Diplomacy Championship.
But what are thoughts of Diplomacy players on the Diplomacy going on here?
I think our Secretary of State, John Kerry, is doing a brilliant job lately in 
trying to manage this and I'll tell you what my Diplomacy instincts tell me
is the secretive (what Diplomacy is supposed to me most of the time) part of
what is going on, slowly.
Note that all of the Security Council countries of the UN have literally or figuratively
declared war on DASH (the new preferred word to call them, since it is the Arabic
acronym and they seem to hate it...), including China!
This is significant and the first time that has happened since the formation of the UN,
if I'm counting right.
BUT notice how the other Middle Eastern countries are still being relatively silent.
How will they go on this? 
That is the diplomatic key, and what happens about the treatment of women?
Today's Sunday New York Times has a long chilling article about the treatment of women
within and around the DASH organization.
That to me is the real war here, and we must win it, for the benefit of half the world's
population.</b>
