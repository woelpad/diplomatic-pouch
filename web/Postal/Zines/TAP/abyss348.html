<div class="p"><!----></div>
We dedicate this issue to Don's memory.

This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
And then I could have soloed the second game, but well, I can't exactly 
say how I did it, but the Canadian player soloed there, with help from me.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals SHOULD start any day now.
But you still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!

Horrible news about Don.  I didn't know him well, but given the complexity of the 
moves in PRM we spoke on the phone a few times and exchanged regular emails.  
The first time we tried to hook up over the phone he got confused about the 
time given the different coasts we live on and ended up calling me late 
(our time) at night and my wife answered as I was asleep.  
The next morning she told me how nice and pleasant Don was just based on 
their brief exchange.  He definitely was a strong player.   
In PRM, I (England) was able to go after him right from the get go 
with support from Germany.  I couldn't believe how he was able to 
hang on by coordination with Italy!  Eventually I turned on Germany and 
he and I ended up in an alliance in order to hold off the eastern powers.  
He always took the long view; made sure that neither of us was in a 
position to stab the other; and made strong move suggestions.   
I was shocked to find out that he was withdrawing from the 
games and we exchanged email afterwards which is when I learned of the terrible news.   
I wish I had known him better and longer.

<b>If it Walks Like a Duck and Quacks Like a Duck...</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 ...then we're talking about Donald "Duck" Williams, 
Dip Player Extraordinaire and Friend Supreme.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Twin Sons of Different Mothers.   For those of you who remember pop singer Dan Fogelberg, 
he cut an album of the same name with a fellow named Tim Weisberg.  
While the LP wasn't exactly a barn-burner, the title described the 
strange symbiotic relationship I had with Don.  
In many ways, we were indeed cut from the same bolt of cloth.  
Don and I shared August birthdays within a week of each other, 
and we were a year apart in age.  Unfortunately for both of us, 
cancer hit us both at 56.  I was diagnosed with Stage IV appendix 
cancer on my birthday in 2012; Don got the bad news about his 
advanced kidney cancer a year later, on <i>his</i> birthday on 2013.  
Eerie, to say the least.  Both of us did well with initial chemo, 
and both of us had a flare-up afterwards.  My cancer was always predicted 
to return, perhaps in a few years; it came back in less than three months.   
Don's never went away, but just got worse.  And so I type this eulogy 
with an immense load of Survivor's Guilt, that it was him that went, and not me.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Let me just pound home here, Mark, that we are REALLY glad that 
we and Margie still have you around!!!
No matter how awful cancer is, we have to salute the survivors.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Don and I were gamers early on in the Golden Age of Dip, and, after we 
"clicked" in some early postal games, he and his son came to visit 
my wife and I when we were stationed in California.  From there we forged 
quite a friendship, with Drama Galore.   When we were "in synch" we spent 
hundreds of dollars in phone bills (pre-email days, for you young whippersnappers), 
talking for hours about the games, then digressing to a million 
different stream-of-consciousness topics.  
I think I talked to Don more than I did to my then-<i>fianc&#233;e</i> (now wife) - but 
don't tell her that.   
We talked tactics, we talked profiles of our foes, and we learned each others' 
strengths and weaknesses; those came into play against enemies and, 
occasionally, when we decided to stab each other in games.  
Coupled with those talks and letters (God, did we ever write letters; 
a lost art now!) were the Cons we’d attend:  DixieCon, with 
Jim-Bob, Kathy Caruso and the gang, and the DC cons 
(some sort of "tea society" name, if I recall... damn chemo-brain, anyway).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The high point in the Fassio-Williams gaming era came in a 1988(?) 
game with Melinda Holley and three others who I can't remember to save my skin 
(with the chemo I take, I’m lucky to just remember my own name, let alone 
the year of the game).  Don and I formed my favorite alliance 
(R/T) and we were getting pounded by the board.  We easily traded centers and 
shared info just to stay alive and, lo and behold, we stormed back to a tense 17-17 tie.  
From that game I used to think we were Diplomacy's version of the 
Hindenburg-Ludendorff team in WW1.  That being said, we were both emotional, 
quick-to-flare types –- his Irishness and my Italian-ness were like oil 
and water sometimes.  So there were instances when we would stop talking 
to each other, or threw acrimonious darts at each other over some game 
slight -– I will readily admit that the majority of thrown darts were from me, 
which he either deftly parried or mercifully ignored.  
I remember that he and Jim O'Kelley (and Steve Emmert) decided to hose 
me at one `Con because of a previous lucky game I solo'ed (with Steve’s help and mercy).  
I had a hard time understanding a Diplomacy Basic Premise - that you could 
and should separate "personal friendship" and "game friendship" at times.  
I look back now on those instances as part of my Really Dumb Experiences, 
when I was a younger fool than I am currently.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That being said, for every rip in our fabric when we'd have an issue, 
we always sewed it back together and weaved a stronger fabric.  
He was a true gentleman and a tremendous player - especially in FTF environments -– and 
today is a sad day to be typing this in a "memorial" capacity.  
He was taken way too early, and the fabric is split for many a year to come, unfortunately.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Don, I know you and Walkerdine and Calhamer and all the others are up there 
around a board right now.  I’m not sure when Death is going to cash in my 
chips at the table, but when he does, save me a seat next to you.  
Just don't make me Austria.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The last sprint points are claimed, the pack is still all jumbled, 
and we likely have our first pack dropped rider (I keep everyone on the track
regardless of how far they are dropped, and he might yet be saved with help).
Only Andy Bate gets over 20 in total turn replenishment, and that just barely.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
I have decided to say a few remembrance things now, and do more in the July 
<i>Diplomacy World</i>, and I encourage all of you to write for that too that 
knew Don and want to leave a record of your thoughts.
Cancer, especially cancer like this, comes so quickly and it seems we had 
so little time as Don's friends to come to terms with this.
My first time meeting Don in person was some time in the 1980's, but
I'm not entirely sure when precisely it was. 
I was in Los Angeles for something or other, and I rented a car and drove out
into the Valley where he lived at the time and met up with him for most of a day.
Like Mark Fassio, I had many phone calls and long letters exchanged before that,
and we hit it off very quickly.
Through much of the last thirty years, Don and I have been very close inside
and outside the hobby.
Today, I wanted just to offer a couple of brief vignettes.  
One of our great capers of all time was the exposure of Harry Andruschak as
Sara Reichert.  
Harry was a horrible (well, not very good) Diplomacy player, and he lived 
with the Reichert family in California.
He invented a new Reichert daughter named Sara and playing under that pseudonym 
won a whole slew of postal games.
Harry was GREAT as Sara.
Don Williams and I suspected that something was up in the relationship 
between Sara and Harry, so I went to California, and we went to "Sara
Reichert's" house.  And there we hit luck and found Harry and his 
landlady both there, so we could force out the full story!
Harry took it well, and plotting and executing it took up hours on the
phone with Don.
Then, more recently, after I bought my summer house in Maine, and decided to 
build a swingset in the back for my granddaughter, Emily.
Don was visiting and I went out there to "start" building it from the kit.
Don could tell that I really had no idea what I was doing (including deciding
where to put it, I put one end of it within a foot on one side or the other
of the property line - I just bought the land next door, so which side that
end is on no longer matters), but he just chuckled and helped me get started.
Don and my wife Charlotte did lots and lots of innocent flirting over the
years, which always USED to remind me that Don hadn't really found the love
of his life - I ***KNEW*** he hadn't.
But he finally found Stacey and even though I never managed to meet her, 
I was so happy that Don finally found the right person for him.
Damn, it just wasn't fair that Don had so little of that last part of his
life, but lived it to the fullest, I know that.
We will miss you, terribly, terribly, big guy!</b>
