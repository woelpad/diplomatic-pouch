      <P align=center><B><I>Early Decision</I></B> 
      <P align=justify>
      <P align=justify>With schools out for the summer, thousands of rising high 
      school seniors (and their parents) are busy trying to figure out which 
      college is right for them. Along where to apply, increasing they are 
      facing questions of when and how to apply. The growing popularity "early 
      decision" has changed the entire college selection process, though not in 
      a manner that is necessarily good for all those seeking to get into 
      top-notch schools. Indeed, UNC-Chapel Hill has just decided to end its 
      early decision option, a bold move not without cost for which it should be 
      praised. 
      <P align=justify>Early decision is a form of consideration traditionally 
      available at most top-tier universities and colleges. In recent years, 
      early decision programs have also appeared at many average schools. Early 
      decision is intended to allow top students who are certain of where they 
      want to go college to apply early and get to the heart of the matter &shy; 
      whether they get in or not. Potential students apply to an earlier 
      deadline (typically in early November) and agree to both apply to only 
      that one school and attend if accepted. (Non-binding early consideration 
      options are called "early action.") The colleges, in return, agree to make 
      a much faster decision on applications. For high school seniors and their 
      parents, early decision offers one obvious advantage &shy; they will early 
      on if Johnny or Susie got into the one school of their choice. 
      <P align=justify>For applicants who have a good understanding of the 
      admissions process and money, early decision also allows a means to game 
      the system, to use a college's admissions goals for their own advantage. 
      <P align=justify>Top schools accept a low percentage of applicants but 
      have a high percentage of those they accept enroll. The latter is called 
      the "yield rate." Both the acceptance rate and the yield rate are </P>
    <TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=246 height=588>
      <P align=justify>closely watched by colleges and are among the criteria 
      used by <I>U.S. News</I> to rate schools. Of course, both are things that 
      colleges have some influence over. Sending more admissions counselors out, 
      for example, can generate extra applications, and, in turn, a lower 
      acceptance if a school doesn't change the size of its incoming class. The 
      yield rate is heavily dependent on the number of kids that are accepted 
      through early decision. In theory, all those accepted through early 
      decision should enroll. By comparison the yield, even at top schools, for 
      those accepted through the regular application process may only about be 
      about 30 percent. 
      <P align=justify>An astute applicant that isn't likely to get financial 
      aid uses this system to his or her advantage by applying through early 
      admission even if they are only a an average candidate for the school they 
      want to attend. Colleges are looking to admit through early admissions; it 
      makes them look good. At many top schools, 40 percent or more of an 
      incoming class is selected through early decision. A recent Harvard study, 
      however, notes that on average those accepted through early decision had 
      lower SAT scores and moderately weaker academic background than students 
      admitted through the regular application process. 
      <P align=justify>While early decision can be a very useful process for 
      certain college applicants, it is not an option for all college bound high 
      school seniors. The problem, obviously, is the requirement that those 
      using early decision apply to only one school. Those not completely sure 
      which school is right for them by November of their senior year in high 
      school or those who are interested in seeing which college might offer a 
      scholarship or the best financial aid package &shy; can't make effective 
      use of early decision. As a result, early decision in practice often 
      favors the offspring of the well-to-do with knowledge of the admissions 
      process over those of more humble backgrounds or with less familiarity 
      with the system. 
      <P align=justify>There are other serious criticisms of early decision. It 
      can make the senior year in high school virtually irrelevant. There are 
      also cases of people applying through early decision and then discovering 
      they aren't so sure that they actually wish to attend the school they had 
      committed to (17-year olds can be fickle). 
      <P align=justify>Despite the criticisms of early decision, it still takes 
      leadership to address the issue. This is especially true when one's self 
      interest, in the form of <I>U.S. News</I> ranking, might be adversely 
      effected by one's action. For this UNC-Chapel Hill should be awarded high 
      praise. By eliminating early decision it has already further enlivened 
      debate and, hopefully, will help move us to a better college admissions 
      process.
