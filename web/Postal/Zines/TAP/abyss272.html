<br /><br /><b>Kevin Wilson (Fri, 13 Jun 2003 00:05:05 EDT)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,
All of us at one time or another in our lives have been a rookie at 
something.  Many of us have also had an opportunity to set precedent on some issue or 
another.  But it isn't frequent that a person sets precedent as a rookie.  I 
guess I can claim that distinction, or at least I hope that I can.  In the 
last issue of <i>TAP</i> you gave an update on the World Masters 2003 Tournament.  In 
that discussion you talked about the ruling by the Tournament Management 
Committee on a GM's attempt to roll-back a turn because he failed to honor an 
extension request by a player who was away.  Well, the player that roll-back 
disadvantaged was me.  As you'll see below, the final outcome turned out OK but at the 
time it certainly didn't seem it would be that way.  The NMR that resulted 
from the omitted extension allowed me to get into a position where I was certain 
to get to 18 centers in the fall.  The roll-back not only removed that 
possibility but exposed the planned moves of me and another player and both of us 
objected.  With the roll-back my path was much harder.  I was still certain to 
get to 17 centers but that last, 18th center, was going to be difficult.  It 
took two years but I got not only the 18th but a 19th in the same turn to get 
the solo win and advance to the next round.  The bad news was that in the 
meantime, my team fell down the rankings as one of our teammates was eliminated when 
his game went solo.  He was second on that board and the points for that 
second finish probably would have kept us in the Top 10 but we fell to the Second 
10.  Still a respectable finish, assuming we hold that slot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still think the roll-back was incorrect and hope the tournament considers 
adding rules to address the situation.  That's the precedence part.  As this 
was my first World Masters, I was a rookie setting that precedence.  
<i>((Well, possibly, I will say for sure that your game and this situation
generated a LOT of discussion.
Some people say (and I tend to agree) that the WorldMasters rules have ballooned
to be TOO large and involved.
One problem is that the tournament really has grown to encompass nearly all of
the Diplomacy hobby's disparate communities.
The US postal people, the Internet Judge people, including the Vermont Group people,
the Academy people, the Cat23
people, the Redscape people, the British postal hobby, the Diplomacy 2000 people, 
the European hobbies (Norway, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, Belgium, and more),
the VERY intense Brazilian hobby, the Australian/NZ hobby, and those are just
the ones I know about and stay reasonably connected to.
It doesn't mean of course that everyone from these hobbies plays in this tournament
since then you would have 5000 players or more instead of only about 500.
But it does mean that you have a lot of playing styles, GM styles, and other 
norms of behavior that need to be melded.
This has led the organizers to write a LOT of rules down.
But of course, most players don't read the rules that are there
(not suggesting this of you of this Kevin...) and players still feel that
rules are being thrown at them from out of left field.
I like to think that the TMC can help to smooth out these problems, but we didn't
do that very well in the case that Kevin is citing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I realize 
the tournament has a long way to go and the next round will be even harder 
than the first but I really enjoyed my round one game.  In many pbm games I find 
the other players either write little or never.  In the WM game the 
correspondence was frequent, detailed, involved and fast.  I found it very enjoyable and 
I encourage others to play the next time around.  The play was good too.  The 
players were not only good tacticians, my strength, but excellent 
strategists, the area I sometimes forget.  I found myself fortunate, as Austria, to have 
a Franco-Italian war open from 1901 and continue until Italy was knocked out.  
In the east I had a very good Russian player and a Turkish player who I 
believe was also a rookie to the tournament and perhaps a rookie to Diplomacy.  I 
was able to get them fighting and when the first left an opening, seized it and 
gained the upper ground.  I was either in the lead or tied for the lead 
through 1904 and in 1905 took the center count lead and never let anyone else get 
close.  Germany and I agreed early to just split the game for the first and 
second points and that was what I intended to do until an unexpected opportunity 
presented itself.  In fall 1907 I had the chance to jump from 12 centers to 17 
centers.  But if I took the chance it would be a very hard guessing game to 
get to 18 as I was certain to lose a center and fall to 16 the following hear 
and would need to get the final 2 to win.  I was assured of not falling into 
2nd but I couldn't be sure of getting to 18.  The other choice was to bet less 
greedy and only jump from 12 to 16.  The fewer centers grab kept my units 
closer together and assured me of still getting to 17 but with a better chance of 
getting that last center.  I went that route and then when Germany NMRd I 
thought it was in the bag.  The route turned out to take another, expected, year 
but the outcome was still the same, even with the roll-back.  All in all a good 
game.  And in hindsight it felt better to win and not through an NMR than with 
the NMR, but I would have taken it with the NMR if the ruling had gone in my 
favor.
<i>((I'm sure Dave Partridge and Steve Hutton, among the TMC who surely
are reading this, are happy to hear the update.
I'm happy about that too.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob, next time around, if my current team doesn't field a team or doesn't 
need me, I'd be happy to be on a <i>TAP</i> team and play.  And next time shouldn't 
a subber to <i>TAP</i> get more consideration from the TMC?  ;-)

All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor

except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.

I can finally add SOME of the details for CanCon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It will be held the weekend of August 15, 16 and 17 at the University of
Toronto's Scarborough campus.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Entry fees are dirt cheap at $10/day or $20 for all three days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We're still working on the room rates in the townhouse, but it will probably
be in the $40-$45/night range. Again, this is very cheap and especially so
for the Americans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CanCon is typically a small get together with Diplomacy as the focus, but
all games are welcome and usually provide filler for between Dip games as
well as for the early victims.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rooms are your typical university dorms and the townhouses are quite
nice. The campus is very close to all the amenities (beer, liquor, pizza,
etc) and a good time is had by all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A note of interest for potential attendees: it looks as if I will be running
the Dip tournament this year instead of playing, so someone else can have a
shot at the trophy this year... (G)

If you or anyone else is interested in what I've been doing for the past few 
years, here's a few lines about it. 
<i>((Yes, yes, yes, we're very interested.))</i>
I've sort of found my niche at the UNC 
Greensboro English Dept. I won the only fiction writing scholarship 
available to undergrads for the 2003-2004 academic year. I'll be a junior 
this year - I think the last time I was really in contact with anyone in 
the diplomacy hobby was when I was a junior in high school. After I graduate 
from UNCG, my plan is to go get my MFA somewhere in creative writing. I have 
a wonderful girlfriend, Jane, who I've been dating for almost a year. So I 
would say things are going very well for me, and I'm really glad to be back 
in a game of Diplomacy again.

Last week, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a lower court ruling that the
legal definition of marriage ("one man and one woman") was unconstitutional
(which courts in British Columbia and Quebec have also found), but it threw
out the part where the judge suspended the effect of the ruling for two
years to allow Parliament to come up with a new law.  The court said that,
effective immediately, the term marriage applies to "two persons", the
province must register the same-sex legal marriages performed by the
Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto in 2001 and any future same-sex
legal marriages, and municipalities in Ontario must issue licenses for
same-sex marriages.  For more on the ruling, see:
http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's a bit of a wedding boom going on in Ontario right now as local
people, people from other provinces (who will have problems getting their
marriages recognized), and people from other countries (who will have much
bigger problems) decide to tie the knot. According to our national news,
"Ontario may well become the gay and lesbian Las Vegas".

"Finding Nemo" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pixar has once again combined a pretty well developed story line with some
very good animation.  This is a delightful little movie.  "Marlin" (Albert
Brooks) is a clown fish with a real fear of the world.  He wasn't always fearful,
but one tragic day his entire life was ripped away except for one little egg. 
His wife wanted at least one of their babies to be named "Nemo" and so the
remaining egg was "Nemo" and "Marlin" devoted himself to protecting "Nemo"
from the world.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Nemo" being a high energy kid had his own ideas.  He thought his dad was a
bit too timid, but he loved him anyway.  Then, when "Nemo" was taking a step
beyond childhood and "Marlin" was reacting very badly to it, "Nemo" was
caught by a human diver who scooped the little clownfish up and took him off to
live in an aquarium.  "Marlin" forgot his fears and took off in pursuit. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Along the way he picked up some unlikely companions.  He met Dory (Ellen
DeGeneris) a Bluefish with short term memory deficit.  Dory really wants to help,
but she keeps forgetting what exactly she is helping do.  And, you have to meet
`Bruce' a shark on a twelve step program to stop eating fish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the meantime, "Nemo" discovers that his dad wasn't quite the timid fool
he thought him to be.  The world really is dangerous.  "Nemo" isn't just
trapped in an aquarium tank in a dentist's office, he is slated to be a birthday
gift for the dentist's niece.  The dentist's niece, "Darla the fish killer!".  
Nemo's days are numbered.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One small side note, Pixar really nailed seagulls.

"The Hulk" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ang Lee did something wonderful with "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".  
<i>((Well, perhaps, I really didn't like it, so I came into this one
with great trepidation....))</i>
He really seemed to be trying to make more out of "The Hulk" than was really
there.  Back in the days when Marvel was taking off as a comic book empire,
"The Hulk" was one of the lesser titles.  It didn`t matter.  Marvel was hot and
almost anything sold.  
<i>((They even "copied" characters, as General Ross and Jonah Jameson seemed
cut from precisely the same stock character mold.
The movies played this out in annoying detail.))</i>
The underlying premise, the 98 pound weakling gets picked
on and turns into a powerful destroyer, has its appeal.  But there was not a
lot of depth to the concept.  Just variations on the same story month after
month.  Ang Lee tried to supply some depth.  He gave "Bruce Banner" (Eric Bana)
a back story, some repressed memory, a mad scientist father (Nick Nolte plays
the older version), and a girlfriend "Betty Ross" (Jennifer Connelly) who
wants Bruce to open up and get in touch with his emotions. 
<i>((....and is a scientist in her own right, I don't recall that one from
the comic.
She was just General Ross' daughter there.
This part had some potential that was largely wasted.
And this makes twice for Ms. Connelly that she is playing a smart scientist
caught in a love story.
She did a much better job of it as a mathematician in "A Beautiful Mind".
There were way too much goo-goo eyes here as she pleads for Bruce to open up.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thing is, despite all the extras, it is still a pretty limited idea.  I found
myself drifting off into thoughts about some of the stuff in the old comics
and thinking about other movies.  In short, I was not really captivated by the
movie.  Nice try.  Some really good computer graphics, but I walked out
thinking that since I hadn't really expected all that much I shouldn't feel as
disappointed as I did.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Maybe if there had been more Hulk and less angst I would have liked it more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hollywood Homicide" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a very complex story.  The complexity comes from the characters
rather than the plot.  Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) is a veteran homicide detective.
He is also a real estate agent on the side.  He is also an investor in property.  
He is in hock way up past his ears.  K. C. Calden (Josh Hartnett) is a
younger homicide detective who is also an aspiring (if fairly talent free)
actor, and a yoga instructor on the side.  He says that there is deep spiritual
meaning in yoga, and it's a great way to meet women.  
<i>((Did you see him reading Yoga Magazine instead of TAP???))</i>
He seems to have women
lining up around the block, so there must be something in what he says.  Of
course it doesn't hurt that he looks like Josh Hartnett.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They are working on a gangland style killing that turns out to be related to
another killing that has them stumped.  The cop part of the story is pretty
straight forward.  The bad guys kill people and the cops dig into it until they
find someone who explains it to them.  Then they go after the bad guys, who
apparently are not smart enough to figure out that hearsay evidence isn't enough
to get them arrested much less convicted.  That really doesn't matter.  It's
the characters who make the movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is some pretty interesting action.  Some of the funniest car chase
scenes I've ever seen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

"Rugrats Go Wild" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You really need to be a cartoon fan to get a lot of what is going on in the
movie.  It probably helps to be a young cartoon fan.  I count myself as such.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are a lot of characters in this movie.  The Thornberrys alone have
six members, five humans and Darwin, if you consider "Donnie Thornberry human
(there is more than a single school of thought there).  Compared to the 
"Rugrats" with eight adults and seven babies, and Spike (who thanks to Eliza's
peculiar talent has a speaking role) the "Thornberrys" are in the minority.  
So, with twentysome characters, all who get a fair chunk of screen time, the
story ought to be pretty incomprehensible.  Some how it is not.  There is a fair
amount of chaos.  That's typical of both families, but despite the many
different things going on, it was all pretty easy to follow, and even made a small
amount of sense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Characters from each group were paired with their opposite or complement.
"Chuckie" spent a few minutes thinking that "Donnie" was his reflection. 
"Eliza" and "Spike" had a conversation .  Well, "Spike" who admitted that his full
name was "Get down off the couch Spike!" did most of the talking.  "Angelica"
decided that "Debby" was her role model and mentor.  "Debby" saw it as an
opportunity to add to her personal slave labor force.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Very well done.  I loved it.

"The Italian Job" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been sort of sitting on this for a week now.  This is a caper movie.
I love a caper movie.  Well, I usually love a caper movie.  I really liked the
trailers.  Oh boy, a caper movie, and full of people I like, too!  Well, I'm
not that impressed with Mark Wahlberg, but all the rest of the cast are good.
It turned out to be a three for the price of one caper movie.  Maybe two
capers too many, I don't know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There was never any real tension.  The really big action was a car chase
through the sewers with Mini-Coopers.  Even beefed up, and making impossible
jumps, they are still Mini-Coopers.  We are talking cute car, not car chase
thrilling car.  The Mini-Cooper car chase is a metaphor for the whole movie.
F. Gary Gray directed the caper film and I felt that he really didn't get the
concept.  Way too long on cute and not enough thrilling.

<i>((Yes, it really did fall flat.
Ultimately, I thought the Mini-Cooper chase was OK, not the worst part of the
movie.
I thought it really was hurt by losing Donald Sutherland early, who is a 
great, great caper actor.
And it didn't help how they tried to "hang on to him" through the movie.
It was just distracting and made me long for a different movie that wasn't
being made here.
Amazingly, Mark Wahlberg might have been the best thing in the movie.
It was definitely the biggest waste of Edward Norton in the last decade.
I need to go watch "American History X" again to clear my mind....))</i>

"28 Days Later" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When I first saw the trailers for "28 Days Later" I recognized it.  It was a
Zombie movie.  Not really something I would go out of my way to see.  But my
daughter voiced her intent to see it in the same sort of voice I might have
used for "Harry Potter."  Intrigued, I put it on my list.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is sort of your classic Zombie thriller done with an incredible amount
of class, and Danny Boyle even threw in a story.  First, there are no Zombies. 
The Zombie roles are being filled with badly diseased people whose brains
have been reduced to mindless rage.  Technically they are not Zombies because
they are not dead, yet.  In all other ways they fill the role.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie starts with a break-in by some animal rights activists.  They open
up a top secret lab full of test animals.  In freeing the animals they also
unleash the virus infecting them.  For lack of a better name the scientists call
it "Rage."  It turns anyone or thing infected into a killing machine.  It is
highly contagious. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
28 days later, Jim wakes up from the coma he was in to discover that he is
the last person on the planet.  At least that's they way it seems at first.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Danny Boyle has a wonderful visual sense.  He combines images in such a way
to rivet you to the screen.  Well, rivet me to the screen at least.  Unlike
`The Hulk' of the week before my mind and attention never wandered.  There was
not a lot of action, and the almost traditional march of the Zombies against the
beleaguered group never occurred.  The story was about discovering how to
deal with the impossible, and about learning that humans are the only true
monsters, and they do not need to be infected by a virus to make it so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
-

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For those who haven't heard it, here's the background story:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In January, I met Karen Dunning, and over the next few months we gradually
came to recognize that we want to spend the rest of our lives together.
Among our many common interests is a taste for long road trips, so later
this summer we'll be driving up to Alaska together, where we'll spend some
time staying at my mother's house.  Before that happens, I'll be singing in
an opera in Mendocino Music Festival which provides housing for two weeks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm scheduled to be in Mendocino from July 5 to July 20. Shortly after that
we start our road trip. We have no calendar to keep to, so we'll travel as
slowly as we feel like. Also undecided is how long I'll stay with Mom.
(Karen might need to fly back sooner.)  After that, I don't know where
we'll end up. My best guess is that we'll be back in California some time
around October, then we'll stay here till about January before eventually
moving north to settle somewhere permanently, probably in the Seattle area.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even after we move away, I'll probably want to return to California
occasionally to visit, and perhaps to perform with one of the groups I've
gotten to know well down here. If you have a house that easily accommodates
a guest, I might be interested in staying with you for such a visit. Also,
it's possible that I'll be looking for a temporary sublet some time around
December, so let me know if you hear of anything.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the rest of the week, I'm trying to empty this apartment of all of my
belongings, and most of it is being thrown away or given away. If you're
interested in free stuff, let me know. A lot of it is junk, but there's
some good stuff, too. Included are:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- a Windows computer, old but working

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- various small furniture

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- numerous miscellaneous household items

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- lots of old clothes, including some weird costume type stuff
<i>((I wish I was closer for this....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you want to come by and take stuff off my hands, or if you want a more
detailed list, call or email. The sooner the better; I've only got a few
more days, so I'm trying to get rid of stuff as quickly as possible.

<i>((Great, Mark, I'm especially glad I caught you on my recent trip to SF,
along with Jason Bergmann, Jody McCullough, and Richard Weiss.
And sorry we missed Pete Gaughan, who actually did most of the work getting
us all together, but then couldn't make it himself.
We had a great time one evening playing a couple of quick games and I got
to hear first hand about the new changes in Mark's life.
Most of the people I know like Mark make choices like Mark is about to make,
even including the finding of life partners late in life.
I wish him all the best on this trip and everything else.
I'm hoping we'll hear some more from him that I can update you all on.))</i>

Can we get the Homeland Security Department to prosecute the ACC for

Well... it's Sunday afternoon and I'm hanging out at the lab while Matt tidies
up a few of his experiments.  I must admit for the 4 or 5 hours sleep I had last
night I was feeling pretty chipper as tournament director today, but as it's all
over now I think I'm fading fast :-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So what better way to pass the time than report the results to all and sundry.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There were 4 boards for Rounds 1 and 2 on Saturday, and 3 on Sunday.  A pesky
number of people turned up each round so a total of 8 people were asked to stand
down during the tournament.  Hopefully we'll have better luck in this regard
next year.  A big thank you to David Maletsky, Taylor Hayward, Babak Moradi, Don
Woodring, Avi Pfeffer, Jim Burgess, Chris Lahey and Mike Belanger for
volunteering to sit out one round each. In hindsight had I known so many people
would have to stand down I might have scored the tournament as the two best
games, something to think about for next year I guess. :-)

<i>((This was a whole lot of fun.
Detour has quickly (instantaneously) become my favorite tournament scoring
system, WAY better than ARMADA, better then Yerkey 29 centers, better than
C-Diplo, and EVEN better than ManorCon which has been my favorite scoring
system to date.
As Mel notes, I sat out Round 2 by choice.  I coulda been a real contendah
if I had played all three rounds.....
I didn't think it was great though just because I did well.
It really was the best non-play distorting system I've played under
in many year.  
In both my games, I just "played the game", even though I tried to
pay attention to the scoring system.
We had time limits, but they only came into play for one game in each round, I think.
And even in those games it didn't distort things much.
On the next page, Larry Peery asks an evaluation question and here's my evaluation of
the Boston Massacre by that system.
See if it helps you respond to him (seems a bit sterile to me....):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Provincial/State, though we did have a horde of non-NEers and Pitkissers;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Boston Massacre, MIT Campus, Boston, Massachusetts, June 20-21 (Summer Solstice), 2003,
Mel "Pox" Nicholson - Tournament Director and Host, 32 participants.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) See the MADip-L Yahoogroup for FULL details.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) A N/A; B 4; C 4 1-4 (deal at the Hostel was great!) 2-3 3-4 4-5; D 4 1-4 2-5 3-4;
E 5; F 4; G 5; H 5 1-5 2-5 3-5 4-5 5-5 6-5@ (lots of great "extras") 7-5@ (the "lobsters"
were gorgeous and unique!); I 5 (special note to the "learners" event two weeks before the
main event where we taught people how to play!); J N/A; K 5 (especially for a first time event)
1-5 (hey, look how many people we had!) 2-4 3-N/A; L N/A; M 5@ (these results above - and I 
cut some - and the discussion on MADip-L was great.  We had loads of fun going over everything
afterward!); N 1-5 2-5 3-4 (I'll bet we get internationals coming next year with more notice!);
O 5 (Mel hit the Budget ON THE BUTTON, and it was a cheap con!).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You ALL must come next year, or else!!!
I didn't make the Friday night before barbeque, but heard it was fantastic.
Some people drank too much, but I cleaned their clocks on the table despite making the
hour round trip back home to Providence twice.
I've got way too much room here on this page..... so let me find some other of my post con
bonmots....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the Scoring System: I did look at the other tournaments run under Detour that Mel
noted.  I'd looked at them before, but not recently.  It reminded me that Mel once pulled a Maletsky/Hayward/Burgess/Babak/ etc.
and sat out a game in one of these tournaments.  Also, Turkey and
Italy generally did better in these tournaments than they did here
at the Massacre.  I was seriously disappointed by the Italian
play I saw in the tournament, but Turkey was just a "small sample"
problem, I think.  And none of this had ANYTHING to do with detour.
In my view, again.
I actually rank my favorite countries somewhere nearer to the reverse
of this ranking.  I did better as Russia in this tournament than
I almost ever do, and even though the result wasn't great I was
pleased with my England play as well.  But I would have liked
to play Italy or France..... average score in Massacre, Country....
19.4   England; 19.030 Russia; 19.029 Austria; 14.5   Germany;
11.2   France; 9.5    Italy; 7.4    Turkey.         
Ahhh, but it's all in who the players are anyway.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On ME (it's all about ME....): I was really interested to hear through the grapevine how much
"get Jim-Bob, watch out for Jim-Bob" talk was going on in my
games.  I'm truly touched that you were that worried about someone
with as poor a tournament record as I have.  Perhaps I play better
as a target????  Anyway, best tournament result for me since the  
early 80's and late 70's when I was much, much more successful.

Profit:  Mel made a profit of just precisely</i> $<i>3.60..... I said: 
Buy yourself a WELL deserved beer with the 3.60!!!  Congratulations
and thank you.  We all had an incredibly good time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's enough for now, I think I've mostly filled this last page.
Peery follows on the next two pages.  
I noted that he didn't supply his E-Mail address on the pages.
You can connect with Peeriblah Central at peery of ix.netcom.com,
remember, take out my connector and replace with the @ sign.
I do think he is comprehensive in these ratings and that if 
you fill this out with more verbiage than I did above, you would
get a more interesting response.  Then again, perhaps Larry wants
statistics.
I think we're still below the level where Ministers of Tourism
have a serious interest in us, but not FAR below that.
The hobby is amazingly international right now.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The extremely earnest EFGIRT draw is rejected.
A concession to Italy is now proposed equally earnestly.
Please vote on this proposal with your Winter orders.
If you fail to vote, it just might pass, but probably won't
because failure to vote vetoes draws around here.
I do have more than one vote in hand for this proposal, so it is NO joke.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Allan Heikkinen NMR's and disappears.  It is probably about time to go public
with my suspicions that Allan was being "played" by Jim Sayers and thus this
disappearance is not a coincidence.
I did do quite a bit of research trying to prove this, but there really is
an Allan Heikkinen living in this area, he's a retired teacher.
It's possible that Allan is just a close friend of Jim's, but the c/o 
postal address that Allan was using (reproduced for the last time above)
always made me nervous.
I had Internet pros try to help me prove that the E-Mails I was getting from
Jim and Allan were done on the same computer, but the E-Mail clients they
were using did not allow for this test.  
It all was done very professionally (including the fact that I always received
orders from Jim and Allan on different days with different VERY strict order
writing formats).
I salute the process even if in the end I deplore the acts.
I wish we knew the truth, but unlike my exposure of Harry Andruschak's 
little deception, I can't travel all the way to Australia to prove it in person.
If anyone reading this knows more than what I know, I'd appreciate hearing it.
I presume that Jim/Allan have resigned all their positions in their various
games and would be interested to know if that is NOT true anywhere that
I'm not paying attention.
I hope that this disruption is over and that this game can go on.
I wish I could have done more, sooner, but I tried.
At least you guys get to meet a lot of my standbys.
Here we have Mark Kinney.
Thanks, Mark!!

1) Jody has a job change (good he says) that makes him unable to play
at the moment and regretfully resigns.
Jack is just being Jack again, I hope he returns.
Remember, Jack, that you need to get back to me by the SUMMER deadline
to keep the position.
Calling Brad as a standby for you should be the appropriate spur to 
return to action.

shoot at.  Something that ain't us.

going to kick some very serious ass.  (Well, I am ... you're sort of going
to go along for the ride; while I blitz the continent, you'll putter around
in North Africa for a few years before getting your pasta-addled self

finally went out and bought a Mekons CD.  Fear and Whiskey.  Good music,
but not something I could ever dance to.

I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
But you never know, given how extreme the yuppiedom part of the game
has gone.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper, Sean O'Donnell, Dave Partridge, Alexander Woo, Eric Ozog
and Kurt Ozog are in to be six of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Yes, I did put the wrong month for that Spring deadline, that should be
July, not June.
It's corrected above, and like all the games in the szine with an additional
week added.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) There is a proposal for a concession to Ukraine.
Please vote with your spring orders.
Failure to vote vetoes the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "History has a stutter and it says..... wwwwwwwatch out!!!"
I can't precisely recall which song that one is from, but it has a good X-Files feel to it....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KURT - JIM): How about we start using X-Files episode
titles for Dip games instead of the Mekons.  Would
that constitute a blasphemy?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE KURT OF THE OZOG'S): Basically, yes.....
I've not nearly run out of Mekons songs for game titles.
I do have another regular Diplomacy game opening coming up,
what would you suggest?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRIOR TO THE BATTLE, A CONVERSATION BETWEEN SPOCK AND KIRK
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ENTERPRISE):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock - Captain, I'm receiving a very unusual distress signal
emanating from Klingon space!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I didn't know that Spock said ANYTHING with an exclamation
point!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk - Unusual!
In what way?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock - The signal is barely audible and it's being carried on a hardly
noticable Borg trans warp frequency.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk - Is 7 of 9 still on Commander Worf's ship?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock - Yes, Captain!
She is still the Federation tactical liaison to Commander Worf and
the Klingon Empire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk - Can you read the message?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock - It's encrypted and the frequency is so low that I may miss
a few words.
I doubt that the Klingons are even aware of the transmission.
I'll have a translation for you right away.
Here it comes... imminent danger... a partial scan of Worf's DNA
reveals an anti-proton signature... am attempting escape!
7 out!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk - Anti-proton signature!
That can only mean that....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock - Worf is in reality the evil Commander Worf from the parallel universe!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk - I really hate those guys!
You know, Spock, even in the parallel universe the Klingons hate the Romulans
and the Bajorans.
There's no way that Worf, even the evil Worf, would join the Romulans!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock - It would, how you humans say "really suck for us!" if they did!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lt. Uhura - Captain, I'm getting distress calls from Deep Space 6, Deep
Space 7, and the Federation Starship Excelsior, deep inside Federation space.
THe Klingons are invading the Federation!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk, completely stunned, looked at Lt. Uhura and with visible fear in his eyes asked:
"You're not going to sing are you?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lt. Uhura - No, Captain!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk - Boy, that's a relief!
For a second there, I thought this was "serious"....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And for a second there I was going to jump in and exclaim, "Kirk and 
visible fear?  Never, Never!!!" 
But then it was all OK, we've all heard Uhura sing, and she DID kiss Captain 
Kirk that once....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Well, you know how long I've been waiting to find an 
opportunity to do that??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SPAIN): I suspect so, but now what happens?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BRITAIN): Runaway...! Runaway...! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB BEATS): Get me down....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UNCLE JEFFY POOH to SEAN): I can't believe you attacked me!
Me of all people!
After all we've been through together!
The job at Eric's and Bob Evans!
The Indians game, the work for cash under the Indians game,
the work for cash under the table, the cutlass, the endless
hours of teaching you to play Stratego and Diplomacy!
I am very sad that it has come to this!
I take this very personal as a disappointment, but more 
importantly than that I think it is important for me to say....
Nice Back Stab!
I'm proud of you!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): I hope you like the three front war.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SPAIN): That presumes that he fights on three fronts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KURT - PAUL):  Nothing personal Paul. Call me a cop-out
schweinhund for my actions if you will, but it makes
no sense to think Ukraine would abide by a 5-way draw
at this stage of the war. It's not about revenge for
my fallen comrade brother in Italy. Cheers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE DAY AFTER, CAPTAIN'S LOG): The apparent fall of the Federation is
at hand.
The Klingons have allied with the Bajorans and the Romulans, and are invading
Cardassia from three sides and the Federation from 2.
The Klingons have taken Deep Space 6 and never left Deep Space 5 as 
promised.
The Romulans have a starship in Federation space within striking distance
of Vulcan, Pluto Station, and Mars.
The Romulans screwed up and let us keep Deep Space 8 in Ferengi space but
this is a temporary victory.
We can't hold it.
What's worse than all of that is 7 of 9 is missing behind Klingon lines.
I can handle the loss fo the Enterprise, and even the fall of the 
Federation, but losing 7 of 9 to the Klingons would be a "real disaster".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UNCLE JEFFY-NEPHEW SEAN): You dog!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY-SPAIN): You'll pay dearly for that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to WORLD): It had been suggested by someone about six months ago
that it should be against the rules for relatives to play together
in the same game.
Hindsight being a wonderful thing, I now agree.
We should not allow our relatives to play together.
You just can't trust them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY-EGYPT): I thought you told me you under your nephew under wraps.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to "GERMANY"): Huh?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to WORLD): Sorry, I couldn't resist, write me up a ticket for GM
interference.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE COSMOS): Paging Black Fire.
Black Fire, can you read me?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(COMMANDER WORF to CAPTAIN KIRK): .... have captured 7 of 9!
Am dee-briefing her as we speak!
I will probe her Borg "Implants" in an attempt to "interface"
with her remarkable technology for the benefit of the Empire!
