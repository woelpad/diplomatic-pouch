learn how to lie to get what they need;

<p>
and after they got what they needed,
it turns into a simple case of greed."

<p>
(from ``Darker Side", written by Bruce McCabe, covered by Jonny Lang on 
his 1996 album <i>Lie To Me</i>.)

<p>
Thanks to Mike Barno for this contribution!!  More are welcome.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>OK, what a couple of weeks on the roller coaster (extremely inside joke
quite intended....), but here we finally are again.
Let me first call your attention to the 2001 Hobby Awards Ballot contained
in this issue (postal version) or attached to the Web page if you're looking
at this on the Pouch.
I am pleased to thank Melinda Holley for her long hard work at Chair in
recent years and I am happy to be the new incoming Chair of the Hobby Awards
Committee.
You all MUST vote!!!!  I have promised Melinda more than 100 votes and I
will get them ;-)  (no crooks or hooks....).
In fact, I already have more than a dozen votes in hand since some of you
already might have seen the ballots via E-Mail.... I just got two more
votes while I was typing this....

<p>
Since I will be going to World DipCon in Paris and with this delay, note that
the next two deadlines will be on July 7 and August 4.
Thus, the <i>Tinamou</i> deadline will be July 30th!
For those of you taking Summer vacations in July, this all should be very
congenial, for those of you who aren't, well, we will be a bit leisurely
for the next few deadlines.
Please try to make plans to join us in Paris if you can!!

<p>
<i>Diplomacy World</i>, which I have ALSO been working on and is a partial
contributor to this delay is not done yet, but also will be shortly.
This one will be the most diverse of the three that Stephen Agar and I
have done, I think.

<p>
Lastly, this issue is fondly and sincerely dedicated to David Kovar who
worked long and hard hours beyond the call of duty, plus invested his OWN
money, to replace the main backbone hard drive that supports the DipPouch
and from which you access <i>TAP</i> on the Web!!  Many of you were affected
by this resource being down for the 10 days or so that it was out and it
also affected me getting everyone's orders together.
THANKS, DAVID!!!
                                    
<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are ``taking over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
We have Michael Lowrey's <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a 
Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here 
as <i>Deny Everything</i>'s takes a major chunk of space in many issues.
This issue, we have the latest <i>Tinamou</i>. 

<p>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.meurglys.com

<p>
Help, David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently &#239;n stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter is unlikely to be starting any new games in the <i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
And of course for FIXING everything this time around!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ???</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>We're cancelling the search for Mickey Preston since Paul Kenny already
found him.
I'm looking for other people to search for, otherwise we will take a break.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>My heartfelt and deeply deserved congratulations go out to Lee, who took
over England after Toby Harris' resignation and took that country on to
an 18 center win.
After watching Lee, he is one of the game's truly great players.
553 players started out, ONE finishes.
I'll have much more to say on this in the next issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i>

The new Spring issue should be out shortly and is worth waiting for.
A ``wrap-up" of the 1999 WorldMasters tournament, plus some other great articles.
The previous New Year issue features a doozy of an interview
with Brandon Clarke of New Zealand.
Also, the ``Ruffians'' demo game has a write up with an introduction to the
full negotiation history on the Diplomatic Pouch's Showcase web site.
You can see how our very own Paul Rauterberg was screwed over by former
World Champion Chris Martin not once, not twice, but at least THREE times.
But Chris didn't win.... not that time.
There also are some summaries on all the different ways to play Diplomacy
in the World at the present time and some writeups on last year's major
British Diplomacy conventions.
Kath Collman's write up I found particularly gripping and illuminating reading!

<p>
<i>((Don was responding to my comments on the Survivor payouts asking
if Don wanted to know how precipitously the payouts dropped from million,
100,000 and 80,000 for the first three down to 2500 for last place.))</i>

<p>
Not particularly; I just wanted to know (a) what the others made (I think 
in the first one, the bottom three got $4500, $3500, and $2500), and (b) 
why it was never ``officially" mentioned, either in the official rules or on 
the show.  (It's as if they wanted people to think it was winner-take-all.)

<p>
<i>((Then I commented on Brandon Clarke's statements about Don being
used as the ``model'' for the Don Challenge Cup in Australia.))</i>

<p>
Actually, I haven't read the online <i>DW</i> in a while, but I do know I am not 
the Don in question.  There's even a ``Don variant", ``Don Diplomacy", which 
is regular Dip with two additional rules: the ``greasing train" (one unit - 
I think it has to be an army, but I'm not sure - can move two spaces) and I 
think the ``velvet fist" (one unit gets ``maximum strength", although 
``maximum strength" cannot be increased with supports).  The only ``claim to 
fame" I can make from WDC III was being on the receiving end of a Helga 
Pataki opening - maybe someday I'll explain (a) what it is and (b) why the 
name didn't exist until almost five years after the event.

Canada Too)", as I was the only North American there (Larry was planning on 
going, but I think the sudden ticket price jump from $1000 to $1600 had 
something to do with his changing his mind) - and a pair of Air Jacksons 
(Nike Air Trainer ``E", named for Bo Jackson, whose ``Bo Knows" commercials 
were on at about that time).

<p>
``During the Tournament, all accounts were that Don didn't say much. His 
Diplomacy style was, errr...somewhat limited. Tending towards the `Yeah 
okay man,' and not a lot else. He seemed a quite shy person. Completely the 
opposite to the big, brash, convivial stereotype we have for Americans 
down-under. Not quite what one had expected from someone who had made the 
effort to come all the way from the States for a Diplomacy tournament....''

<p>
Well, that was followed by three weeks in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and 
Auckland, so it wasn't just ``for a Diplomacy tournament".  (Besides, 
SOMEBODY had to represent this country.)
(As a side note, as far as I know, I still hold the WDC record for living 
the farthest from anybody else in the same tournament - I think the closest 
other player was one of the Europeans, which would be about 8000 miles from 
the San Francisco area.)

<p>
And sometimes my ``passive" style works.  I wasn't expecting to do well 
anyway, as I figured the Australians would gang up on me on most boards, 
although being the victim of a Helga Pataki opening (and ending up with a 
minimum possible score for the first round because of it) didn't help matters.
(``A what?"  Italy and Turkey keep Austria to zero builds in 01 by taking 
Trieste and Turkey supporting Italy into Greece rather than Italy taking 
Tunis in Fall 01.  Helga Pataki is a character on the cartoon series ``Hey 
Arnold!" (shown on Nickelodeon in most countries; it's on YTV in Canada); 
maybe someday I'll explain how her name ended up on the opening that took 
place over four years before her character's name was thought up...)

<p>
<i>((Oh... dish, dish, do tell!!))</i>

<p>
Something else that shocked a few people: in the pub on the ground floor of 
the site where the tournament was held, I was following the cricket match 
on TV (if anybody wants details, it was Australia hosting Pakistan, and all 
eyes were on Kapil Dev trying to reach 400 test match wickets).

<p>
And maybe someday somebody will talk about that picture of Jill (the one in 
the first <i>Lemon Curry Color Supplement</i>)...

I bought the new REM album, <i>Reveal</i>, and loved it on the first listen.  
In my opinion this album ranks as one of the best of REM's 20 year career. 
They continue to crank out quality tunes.  Don't be deceived by the
radio-friendly single ``Imitation of Life" with the sugar and spice
la-dee-da pop sound, which is okay, but the other 11 songs aren't like it
at all.  <i>Reveal</i> rocks quietly and does it well, has a big sound, and
picks up the pace from their previous album, <i>Up.</i>  If you thought <i>Up</i>
was too somber and slow, you'll love <i>Reveal</i>.  If you liked <i>Up</i> (which I
do), then you'll love <i>Reveal</i>.  You can't go wrong.  Only one weak track:
the closing song ``Beachball''.

Jim-Bob,
So the NFL has re-aligned.  And they've done it amicably, and, get this, for
the good of the game.  They've got a revenue sharing plan that ensures that
the visiting teams all get the same amount no matter where they go or who
they play.  When Dallas goes to visit the Giants they get the same as when
Cincinnati visits Arizona.  So they all get the same visitor's share, they
all get the same TV revenue, and they have a salary cap that works.  At the
owner's meeting Art Modell said, ``We're 32 fat-cat Republicans who vote
socialistic".

<p>
The NFL is not in trouble.  There are no franchises losing money.  The TV
revenue and stadium attendance goes up every year.  No labor actions since '87.

<p>
Will any owner in baseball notice?  Will anyone in the MLB Player's
Association notice?

<p>
<i>((Yawn.... but I will note that NFLPA isn't necessarily negotiating for
the good of its veteran players.  They renegotiate salaries downward
and cut players so that NONE of their negotiated salaries are really
guaranteed.  It does appear to be competitively balanced though.))</i>

<p>
I don't recall seeing a salary negotiated downward, and recall that the cut
of a player usually means that the team takes a hit against the salary cap
anyway, for the balance of the pro-rated signing bonus.

<p>
<i>((Oh yes, I don't follow it closely, but there are a whole bunch
of examples on the local Patriots, most conspicuously Ted Johnson, who
lost about $2 million in a renegotiation.  And in fact it is the THREAT
of a cut being so damaging to the salary cap that increases the incentive
to cut the salary instead.
I sent you to a web page on the Johnson cut, just so you know I wasn't 
blowing smoke, but I seem to have misplaced it to put it here.))</i>

<p>
While free agency does mean some player movement, it isn't nearly as
pervasive as MLB, and the players don't congregate to just a few teams.  If
anything they congregate AWAY from a couple of them (Arizona and Cincinnati
spring to mind) because of incompetant management.  Kinda the way it ought
to be, now that I think on it.

<p>
And other than Randy Moss, you don't hear a lot of complaining about players
being underpaid.

Jim-Bob,
Why is there a large bug on the back of the new Rhode Island quarter?

<p>
<i>((Yes, I know about RI Pest Control and the ``Big Blue Bug", you really 
can't miss it.  The Rhode Island quarter DID come out and it has a
beautiful ``Ocean State" view on it, nothing like that ugly bug
(which has some charm nevertheless.... a Mr. Potato Head would
have made more sense, did they say anything about all the Potato
Heads scattered around the State at 10 feet tall size???).  I
assume you've seen one by now??? I think it is one of the more
attractive quarters so far.  Have you noticed how ALL of the state
quarters are flying out of circulation into people's pockets!?
What a scam (hidden tax)!!))</i>

<p>
To answer all of the above:
I've not seen or heard of the Mr. Potato Heads.  What's with that?

<p>
<i>((Well, it is a ``fad'' that nearly has run its course, but over the last
two or three years, local artists decorated giant 10 foot tall Mr. Potato Heads
with various inventive names and scattered them around street corners and other
public sites across the state.
This proved to be wildly popular, far beyond the wildest initial expectations.))</i>

<p>
I've not seen a Rhode Island quarter yet.  For some reason the new ones take
a long time to get to here.  I've yet to see a North Carolina quarter in
fact.  I think that I've usually been out of state when I've gotten one of
the new quarters for the first time.  Since I'll be in Illinois, Wisconsin
and Ohio in the next 3 weeks I guess I've got a chance for those two.

<p>
I have noticed that most folks keep most of the new quarters, and send the
older ones back into circulation instead.  I keep telling people that I'm
collecting the whole set.  And when I'm done I'll have...twelve dollars and
fifty cents.

<p>
<i>((Damned straight, what are you going to have on the Indiana quarter??
I'd go for a flying chair myself, no one really knows what a
Hoosier is anyway, so you can convince people it is the sound
of a chair flying from Bloomington to Lubbock.))</i>

<p>
Being from out of state and having graduated from an out of state Big Ten
institution, I'll certainly use that line.  Unfortunately most of the folks
that I know have engineering degrees from Purdue, so they'll steal the line too.

<p>
I think that the state has decided to go with the picture of George Rogers
Clark and Chief Little Turtle on the Indiana quarter, so that'll make the
rest of the nation check their history books trying to figure out who they
were.  Heck, that'll make all the Hoosiers check their history books trying
to figure out who they were.

Such a shame to have one less of a talented generation around. As I
wrote in my message on the Adams website, I saw Douglas many times at
the Angel tube station when I worked in Islington. He would return
everyone's smile of recognition, but few would approach. He was a
towering man, both physically and intellectually, but just a little too
big for real life. I regret not having engaged him in conversation. We
were very much on the same wavelength. One step beyond lateral-thinking! 

<p>
My favourite lines, other than those you 
<i>((Thank Mike Mazzer....))</i>
nailed so well: ``Hurry, or you
will be late." ``Late? Late for what?" ``You misunderstand. What is your
name?" ``Dent. Arthur Dent." ``Hurry, or you will be late - the late Dent
Arthur Dent." Paraphrased, I'm afraid. I haven't been able to bring
myself to listen to my CD collection of the radio original since I
heard the sad news.

<p>
I heard the series when it first played. A very good reason for staying
late at work. Then the double record albums appeared, and the books (a
trilogy in five parts), the videos, the computer game, and the CDs. I
even toyed with the idea of buying the towel. I guess you could call be
a Guide devotee. But there was so much more. Dirk Gently is a scream! 

<p>
Enough! Farewell to the hoopiest frood. Did you visit the website? Some
of the messages were framed just as Douglas would have liked them.
Totally irreverent and scandalously funny. Some people took offense.
Douglas would've been so amused. :o)

A back issue of TAP just emerged from the pile with your comments about
the lack of music in the 70's until the dry spell was broken by Joy
Division, Elvis Costello and the CBGB's gang.  I know it's an old saw
that nothing was happening  but consider that two artists who I'd argue
are among the most important of the last 50 years were in there prime
during that period. Both had major impacts on the shape of music the
world over.

<p>
1) George Clinton: Funkadelic led off with <i>Free Your Mind</i> and <i>Maggot
Brain</i> in 1970 and 1971 respectively; Parliament was at its peak with
<i>Mothership Connection</i> 1976.

<p>
2) Bob Marley issued <i>Catch A Fire</i> in 1973 and followed with major work
through <i>Exodus</i> in 1977.

<p>
And the reason the old saw rings true...well, I think Elvis Costello hit
the nail on the head?

four main camps (before that breakout):

<p>
1) The Deadheads.... nuff said ;-)

<p>
2) The Space Rock Fans (I actually fell in with this group) who were
nuts about bands most people never heard of, like Nektar.

<p>
3) The Jazz People: there were some interesting things going on in
a number of directions in jazz (Oregon, Ponty, Jeff Beck....) and I
also identified some with this group and had a jazz show for awhile.

<p>
4) The Clinton and Marley boys: just as you say!!  Didn't I mention

The Madam opened the brothel door to see a frail, elderly gentleman.
``Can I help you?" the madam asked.

<p>
``I want Natalie," the old man replied.

<p>
``Sir, Natalie is one of our most expensive ladies, perhaps someone else...''

<p>
``No, I must see Natalie.''
Just then Natalie appeared and announced to the old man that she charges
$1,000 per visit.

<p>
Without blinking, the man reached into his pocket and handed her ten $100
bills. The two went up to a room for an hour, whereupon the man calmly left.
The next night he appeared again demanding to see Natalie. Natalie explained
that no one had ever come back two nights in a row and that there were no
discounts...it was still $1,000 a visit.

<p>
Again the old man took out the money, the two went up to the room and an hour
later, he left. When he showed up the third consecutive night, no one could
believe it. Again he handed Natalie the money and up to the room they went.

<p>
At the end of the hour Natalie questioned the old man: ``No one has ever used
my services three nights in a row. Where are you from?"

<p>
The old man replied, ``I'm from Philadelphia."

<p>
``Really?" replied Natalie. ``I have family who lives there."

<p>
``Yes, I know," said the old man. ``Your father died, and I'm your sister's
attorney. She asked me to give this $3,000 to you".

<p>
(Some things in life are certain: taxes, death and being screwed by an
attorney.)

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>REGULAR Diplomacy Game Opening for E-Mail Oriented Players: Tim Miller,
Daniel M&#233;hkeri, and Chris Lockheardt are signed up. 
This game is FREE, but you have to be pretty active on E-Mail or I won't
let you in.

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage but they have turned us down.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.
HELP!!!

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
I've decided to kill the Star Trek Diplomacy opening.  
It clearly wasn't resonating.
I think I'll try again when Colonia ends.
Sorry about that everyone.
I owe Chris Trent $20 back, but according to my records I don't 
have money from anyone else.
If you think that is incorrect, let me know.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED game.
The Breaking Away game is starting below, get me names, riders and cards!!!

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of meurglys.com
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p>
1) Check your addresses, phone numbers, and E-Mail addresses.
If there is something missing or wrong, please let me know ASAP.

<p>
2) I had something in my file for this game from Goz, but it turned
out to be a promise to send orders ``shortly''.
Then Goz left for vacation before I discovered this, so he must NMR.
But I won't call a standby, I'm sure he will be returning.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EDINBURGH-BERLIN): Any emissaries wandering around London looking for someone
in power will be sadly disappointed.  The Scots have overrun the Angles and
moved anything important to Edinburgh.  Please relay this to your lost
ambassador, as he is very overdue for his appointment.

<p>
(ENGLAND to GAME): Trust me, I don't usually play this way.  I will be in
touch soon.  This game hit me at a particularly tough time.  To those of
you who did not take my silence as belligerence, thank.  To those of you
who did, well, I beg you to reconsider.

<p>
(DON to JAMES): I trust you'll believe it when I tell you that I have not
plotted or made noise for or against anyone.  That said, you have to
wonder why England and Italy chose this aggressive opening.  Let's get
in touch fast, or we're both in trouble.

<p>
(ENGLAND to RUSSIA): No harm meant, but I've been playin' this game since
1982 and I've never done that move to SWE and I figured it was about
time.  Let's talk.
<i>((Huh???? That's how I got it....))</i>

<p>
(DON to MATT): Of course I remember you and your flirtation with Chaos
Theory.  You couldn't have picked a better bit of chaos to theorize
about.  Hope we made music this turn and not sparks.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE WORLD):
Two nations on my borders....I hope that War is not coming to mother Russia 
too soon...

<p>
(CHICAGO CALLING): Can you believe our Cubs?  Pitching to boot!  Jim-Bob...where
are the chinks in the armor?
<i>((Beats me.... Sox and Cubbies in the Series, whatta matchup of curses!))</i>

<p>
1) All of those proposals failed.... I won't rename them all.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(AUSTRIA to ALL): This one's ending in a six, maybe seven way draw.
That's what the West is playing for, anyway.
<i>((Those were NOT proposed.....))</i>

<p>
(DAS POPE): (Singing to myself)  Toadfather rows da boat to shore,

like a sewage leak, jimbob loo oo oo OOO YA!!!!!!

<p>
(BROTHY PRESS): ``Ah!  A beer bath!  Won't Shreevy be jealous!"  [Yes, 
that was not a question!]  Buddy floated on the thick broth, trying to 
stay out of the way of dribbles of slop coming out of the beer drinker's 
large and foul mouth.  [My gosh!  That almost sounds like a description 
of Turkish mouths!]  He saw his chance.  Some large hair-like substances 
dipped down into the beer broth, so Buddy grabbed a-holt and was pulled 
from his warm foamy bath.  Freedom at last.  What is that?  Oh, no, a 
tongue.  This slob is licking his beard to savor all of the beer he paid 
his ill-gotten coin for.  Buddy had to let go or suffer the inside of 
that stench factory.  Plop!  Back down into the beer. What now?  Oh, no! 
This slob knocked over the beer glass.  Buddy suddenly went on a flat 
roller-coaster ride along Shreevy's bar.  Ah! Once again!  Free!  What?  
Not another incident!  Here comes the barkeep with a dirty rag.  Buddy 
started to swim ... and now we now what it is like to see Shreevy swim 
in his beer!

ask a load of excuses to do the job that might have been performed by

Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.

We need three more players?

<p>
1) A concession to Italy is proposed.
Please vote with your Summer retreat orders!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to ITALY):  If you have no allies now, and your whines fall on 
deaf ears, you have nobody to blame but yourself.  I offered help (for 
vengeance upon Austria-Hungary) and you couldn't be bothered to reply, 
let alone to use the situation for your long-term advantage.  Apparently 
you imagined you'd waltz into this game, clear the board of small 
powers, and reach 18 unhindered.  I hate supporting my stabber, but I am 
giving what little measure I can against you, and would support France 
to a win if I could.  At least Scott has helped make this game fun.

<p>
(RUSSIA to AUSTRIA): Die, scum, die!

<p>
(NORWAY to RUSSIA): Is there anything specific I can do????

<p>
(BOOB to TOADFATHER): At least someone around here seems to want to be
helpful, rather than hurl invectives!
Communication, communication is the key.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR PO-LLARD to ZA WORLD):
Ah! My Nation along vith za vest of you are experiencing terrible unt times! 
Let us communicate more...it is all vee have left...let us die vith dignity 
and not all za vay...

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL RHODEHAMEL to THE NATION OF ITALY):
I am listening. My armies have incorporated Russian civilians into their 
ranks. We are now a mixed lot.  Both you and France are the rulers of the 
day.  I take full responsibility for the current position that the Nations 
of Europe now are in...the future is yours.
We will stand our ground...I shall give full command of the existing armed 
forces over to General Flashman who at present is marching towards Galacia 
with the Light Brigade...

<p>
(ITALY to AUSTRIA): Look, Kent, the calculus is simple here.  If we fight,
then The Liar wins.  If we don't fight, then we can stop him cold.  You can
have a truce right now, or we can duke it out inside a burning house.
What'll it be?

<p>
(FRANCE to ITALY): 
Pope, yes you may assume that all future corrospondence is indeed a 
fabrication.  I was planning this little move for quite a long time, your 
sparkling personality ALMOST held my hand.  But alas, it's game on. I think 
it will be very close, Austria if you want to join me, please speak now.

<p>
(FRANCE to GM): 
EEET IS NET VAIR. Ve should be able tu built eeen Spain.  VE VILL NOT STIND 
FER EEET.  VE HAV FACTURIES.  Let Us Built eeeen Spain zu blasted GM.

<p>
(BOOB to FRENCH NUT): I think it's time to crack open this nut.
I think we will find a crackpot inside.
I want to print stuff from those who properly worship me.....

<p>
(STEVE to JIM-BOB):  Thou art a wizard; I am not worthy.  Colorado over New
Jersey, just as you forecast lo, these many moons ago.  You SURE you don't
do lottery numbers?

<p>
(BOOB to STEVERINO): If I did, would I tell you???  Thank you, I am happy
for Ray Bourque, not necessarily happy for Ray's ``trip to Boston" with the
Cup, where they had a rally at City Hall with Ray raising the Cup over his
head.  I don't blame Ray for this though.
Back to the ``bad vibes'' press writers...  ;-)

<p>
(FRANCE to WORLD): Hockey is a total bullshit ``sport". Reason #1 - Why don't 
you go watch figure skating.  Only girls skate.  Reason #2 - Hockey knows 
it's doing a girly skating thing and they try to overcome their feelings of 
homo eroticism by putting thugs on skates who punch each other and beat each 
other with sticks.  Nuff said as Freud would say. Reason #3 - Canada produces 
the best Hockey players.  Any Country that North Dakota can beat in a war 
cannot produce ``athletes."  We should all just enjoy reruns of SCTV and be 
done with Canada. Take off Hoser, HEY it's a jelly.

<p>
1) Let's see, the RAG?  The ragman took that one away.
Both the GREAF and the GRIEF gave you all lots of grief, but didn't pass.
Hmmm, there was something else?
Oh yes, a concession to Germany.... while receiving very strong support
from at least one person, it too fails.
That's it for this time.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) Tom Howell wants to know who can figure out from where the names in his  
team are derived.
I guessed something about Mary, Queen of Scots, as the names reminded me of 
something dim in memory about her.
Tom says that is the right period but wrong answer, from which I deduced
that they are fictional characters.
That's as far as I got, the rest if up to you.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.

<p>
3) The concession to the Ukraine is rejected.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Sometimes you see things and you know
they're evil; like a face or a dog or a place; I've got problems you wouldn't
believe; But I'm not quite ready to talk about them.''
From ``City of London'' on <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM-BOB): We have something else in common.
I'm a die hard Cleveland Indians fan.
Since you are a Red Sox fan, that by definition makes you a ``Yankee hater'',
just like me.
<i>((You got that right.... we're gonna bury 'em this year!))</i>
I've also been somewhat of a Red Sox fan because I was a Carl Yastremski fan and
the Indians used to suck.
I was kinda glad you guys got Manny Ramirez if for no other reason than to 
torture the Yankees.
On Star Trek; you are very correct when you say that the overall writing of
Voyager sucks.
They wrote Janeway as a bureaucrat, Tuvok was incompetent, no way Kes and Neelix
should have been a couple, and Paris and Chakotay are just plain bad actors
(so was Kes).
I disagree with you on 7 of 9.
I thought her character really helped the show two-fold.
Her addition and Kes' elimination.
I think that Jeri Ryan is the best ever Star Trek babe and if I was
Paramount the next Star Trek series would be on a Klingon ship with 7 of 9
on it at the current time line.
<i>((Who-boy, are you on a VERY different track than I am.
I would rate Jeri Ryan/7 of 9 about 20th among Star Trek babes.
I would have to think about even ranking Beverly above her.... nah that doesn't
quite work, but I would rank Diana Muldaur/Pulaski/Mulhall/and ESPECIALLY Jones
above her, along with both Dax's, Uhura, Marina Sirtis, 
and practically every woman William Shatner ever kissed (plus Chekov's girlfriend
in ``the Apple'' and Kim Cattrall as the Vulcan in ``The Undiscovered Country'') 
above Jeri Ryan.
Sorry, that doesn't cut it.))</i>
7 of 9 was not helped by the poor writing and the spray paint tight uniform they
made her wear, that was so raw that it was probably meant to impress the Xena
Warrior Princess lesbian following.
<i>((Didn't work, Lawless is about ten times as hot as Ryan to all orientations.))</i>
I also think that Jeri Ryan is a great actress
<i>((I'll give you that she did an excellent job of creating and holding that
difficult character.))</i>
and the best example I can give is the episode where 7 contracted ``Borg Multiple
Personality Disorder''.
Every one of her multiple personalities was believable.
<i>((Missed that one....))</i>
As for the last two part episode ``End Game", you missed the beginning.
<i>((Admittedly true.))</i>
The last 45 minutes make no sense without the first hour and 15 minutes because
of the time travel nature of the episode.
<i>((Hardly, I'm quick and pick things up fast.
I followed the logic of the multiple Janeway's pretty quickly - especially since
something similar was done on the last episode of TNG.
I'll grant you that I might have missed some nuances, but I got what was at
stake and the motivation for the older Janeway's trick on the Borg Queen.
This was not what I was objecting to primarily.
What bugged me THE most, was the hackneyed symbolism of the baby being threatened
and then born JUST as they emerged from the transwarp corridor and the lame final
shot of Voyager flying into the cloud of computer generated Federation ships.
Sorry, to bring the overwhelming emotion of the moment back to the viewers
they needed to focus in a micro sense on the crew, who finally have achieved
what seems like an impossible mission.
Watching Voyager, the ship, being welcomed into the arms of the other ships
was not exciting, thrilling, or emotional.
Those last few scenes were as unemotional and as non-uplifting as I could 
possibly have imagined.
It should have brought a fitting ending to the whole SERIES, not just that 
episode.))</i>
One Trekkie to another: you need to watch that episode in its entirety when
they are replayed.
<i>((OK, I'll make the effort and let you know if my opinion changes.))</i>
I felt it was the best Voyager they ever did. (really)

<p>
(JEFF to JIM-BOB II): I've always wanted to visit Fenway Park.
If I ever make it, I'll call you.
Maybe we could take in a ballgame.
<i>((Seats sell out amazingly far in advance, so be forewarned.))</i>

<p>
(JEFF to JIM-BOB III): My theory on the cause of the energy crunch may be 
incorrect.
Here is my ``it's the Republicans' fault theory''.
The energy crunch could have been artificially started during the last three
months of the Clinton administration for the sole purpose of blaming Clinton.
The Republicans could then take power and ``save'' the day by eliminating
environmental constraints that will enable big oil to make a killing.
By the time the winter of '02 gets here, the problem will have been ``solved'', 
greasing the wheel for the Republican victory in the Congressional elections.
It's also likely that the truth is somewhere in between.

<p>
(SPAIN-GM): Everyone is coming to get me oh no.

<p>
(BOOB to SPAIN): Why are you telling me?

<p>
(JEFF to WORLD ON CONCESSION TO UKRAINE): Nuts!

<p>
(SEAN-GM): I must be losing my builds were way too easy.

<p>
(BOOB to SEAN): Then I'm sure you can lose them just as easily.

<p>
(SEAN-Q(JIM)): Well I must admit that I'm going to screw the story.

<p>
(Q to SEAN): And you think I care?
If I have to, I will just unscrew it.
Let's go for it...

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): ``Reality is stranger than fiction."
The Romulans have been true to their word.
They have returned Mr. Spock and Chekov and they helped the Federation 
gake a Ferengi starbase.
The Romulans did screw up.
They were to take the last Ferengi starbase on the Kragon home world.
A computer malfunction caused four Romulan starships to lose warp capability
simultaneously.
The Ferengi also screwed up.
On the assumption of a Romulan onslaught, they didn't even defend their only
starbase on Kragon.
They maneuvered themselves onto a worthless asteroid and are now completely
surrounded by Federation/Romulan forces.
Had they defended their starbase, they could have retreated in a position
to fight against the Klingon/Federation invasion of Ferengi.
Starfleet intelligence had indicated that the Ferengi might use a ``give it
up to the Romulans'' strategy in hopes of a benevolent occupation by the
green blooded invaders.
But the Ferengi strategy actually in place looks more like a ``give it up
to the Federation" strategy than anything else.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): The Federation doesn't surrender!
Lieutenant Uhura received a communique from an unknown source suggesting 
that the entire galaxy surrender to the Romulans.
While the Romulans have massive ground forces, they only have five front line
starships and they have no way to deploy them in the Cardassian/Bajoran sector.
They do own 29% of the known starbases in the galaxy but the Federation
and Klingon empire are directly in their way.
This war is nowhere near over and with six governments still fighting (OK,
five governments fighting and the Ferengi doing whatever it is that Ferengi
``warriors'' do) it could be argued that it's not even halftime.
The Federation will fight to the last.
THe mere suggestion of an all out surrender to our Romulan competitors could
only come from a government that lacks the heart of a warrior.

<p>
(ITALY to UKRAINE): Is surrender spelled with 2 r's or one?
<i>((Actually, it is spelled with three....))</i>

<p>
(ITALY to SPAIN): Can you use the word ``capitulation'' in a sentence
for me?

<p>
(ITALY to ENGLAND): Is there any difference between the word ``quit'' and
the phrase ``throw in the towel''?

<p>
(ITALY to EGYPT): Should I actually wave a white flag back and forth or
can I just hold it up in the air?

<p>
(ITALY to UKRAINE): Do you prefer the one cheek or two cheek approach?

<p>
(STARFLEET COMMAND to CAPTAIN KIRK): Due to the acquisition of the formerly 
Kragon starbase, the Federation now has the resources to recommission a new
Enterprise, NCC 1701-Z.
Try not to blow this one up!
Starfleet out....
