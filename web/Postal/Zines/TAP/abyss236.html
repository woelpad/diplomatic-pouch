<p>
<p>This issue is dedicated with great sincerity to the memory of Robert 
(and he enjoyed abbreviating it Rob't) Sacks.

<p>
We have all been saddened to hear of Robert's tragically early death, 
just after so many of us saw him in person at World DipCon in Baltimore.
I attach some information I have received and will send a copy of
this issue to Robert's parents along with a sympathy card.
There is no good here, but at least Robert's family can hear
a little bit about how many people stopped to notice and to mourn.
I am struck about how my last memory will be Robert's impassioned
speech at the World DipCon Society meeting in FAVOR of passing the
charter, when everyone expected that when he stood up it would be
to urge a vote against it.

I am sad to report that Robert Sachs passed away Friday, August 18, 2000.  
He was 49 years old.
Robert was heavily involved in the gaming hobby for over 30 years.  
He gave his all, many times over.  
Even those who did not agree with him or his methods, usually agreed that he
had the best of intentions and provided much support for the gaming hobby.  
He made a huge mark, and will be sorely missed.

<p>
Robert's brother, Stephen, is working on wading thru Robert's things and handling his
affairs.  His email is:  stephen.sacks of ey.com

<p>
Robert's parents' address is:
David &amp; Dorothy Sacks,
8 Seneca Court,
Royal Palm Beach, FL 33411

<p>
Robert was single.

I hate these kind of messages:  
I was just contacted by Stephen Sacks (see message below)
concerning the death of his brother Robert Sacks.  Robert had high blood
pressure, and was found in his bathtub Friday morning, August 18, 2000,
preliminary prognosis indicates an Aortic Dissection to be the cause of
death. Per his parents request he will be cremated and there will be a
memorial service in the New Jersey area, date unknown as of this point.
Robert was to have been Fan Guest of Honor at Balticon 35, Memorial Day,
2001, his presence will be missed. One of the events that we were going to
celebrate was to be his 50th birthday party.  Condolences via e-mail can be
conveyed thru me or to his brother Stephen at stephen.sacks of ey.com
I will see that any sent to me will be delivered to the family.  His parents
are not web connected, and can be reached via snail-mail at the following
address:   David and Dorothy Sacks, 8 Seneca Court, Royal Palm Beach, FL 33411
Details will be posted here and elsewhere.  His family has requested that
this information be posted wherever Robert might have been active and
welcome contacts from any of these groups.  Thank you.

<p>
During my first - and ill-fated - attempt to pull FTF Diplomacy 
together nationally 
in the mid 1970s, Robert provided me with results of his events. He made it 
clear that he thought ratings and structure were not anything he was 
personally interested in.  When the present effort started in 1991 Robert was 
prevailed upon, once, to send me results, and again the accompanying note 
made it clear that he thought rating results was a bad idea.  With only these 
contacts I had an image of a rather surely dour ``my way or the highway" type 
of individual.  

<p>
I had the very great good fortune to meet Robert in person at Baltimore two 
weeks ago.  The happiness and energy that abounded from the man gave me a 
whole new image.  He smiled brightly when he told me ratings were ``tools of 
the devil". But I knew then that Robert was only expressing  a mild 
disinterest in a ``zest for life" type of way, and that he was enjoying the 
conversation, as I was.

<p>
I've known of the man for 25 years, I've known the man for but two weeks. I 
miss him, and I regret the missed opportunities.

<i>((Boy, Buz, do you have it just right.  
I first met Robert in person a few years ago at one of Brad Wilson's Vertigo
Games get-togethers in Philadelphia and was just completely drawn in to him
instantly.
Since I was US Orphan Service director back in the 1980's myself, Robert
and I had occasional discussions about the famous ``Covenant'', but I
wish I had met him in person back then too as it surely would have altered
my perceptions.
Of course, I've had Brad Wilson dropping comments on Robert in my ears for
years and I usually find that Brad and I have the same tastes in people
in most ways, so I really was not surprised that I liked him so
much upon meeting him.
I hope that, with the hundreds of people who see this, I will reach everyone
of significance in the Diplomacy hobby who will want to know about this.
Bye, Robert, the Diplomacy hobby will be considerably poorer without your
considerable presence.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Now back to our purpose.....
This is what I think is a chock full issue with lots of great reading.
Getting all of the World DipCon stuff together did require the short
delay and I decided to knock the deadlines back a week (I was going to
have trouble producing the szine the week of Labor Day anyway).

<p>
Don't miss some of the press this month either.
There are some real nuggets in pages and pages of it this issue.
Thanks to all of my great press writers.
Also, you might want to take a gander at the game openings section.
And don't miss the <i>TAP</i> Survivor! wrap up, you heard it here
first.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
This will be going up finally soon as the amount I lose on every paid subscription
rises.
Get your resubs in now and then I'll go up by 50% later this year.
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the new game start announcements below!
BUT, I really won't
start any more until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
Some other options are out there.
Mark Kinney is trying to get his dipszine going again (one game is
already filled), but he may have other openings.
Mark is looking for standbys too.
Contact Mark NOW at 4820 Westmar Terrace #6, Louisville, KY  40222, (502) 412-3079; 
alberich of iglou.com and get on his subscription list.
I'm in the game and you CAN'T miss watching ME play....
there or somewhere else.

<p>
Another new szine is out there: Tim Haffey's ``Who Do You Trust?''
He's going to publish monthly at $1.50 an issue, just another 
example of why I really must raise my own rates, I'm subsidizing
too much.
You can E-Mail Tim at: trhaffey of aol.com or trhaffey of concentric.net
and send subs to: Timothy R. Haffey, Sr., 810 53rd Ave., Oakland, CA  94601.
He has the GAMER's character, so I think if you are a gamer, you're
really like what he does.
He clearly has ``Navy'' in his blood as his father had a long career there
and he had a shorter one.
He is now retired at the age of 59 and has some energy to do things,
and one of the things he wants to do is have a dipszine.

The message:

<b>THE SEARCH FOR GREGORY STEWART</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Gregory Stewart acquired most of his fame in Mark Luedi's <i>Thirty Miles
of Bad Road</i> szine and then also wrote lots of press for Don Williams
and others before fading away.
It is possible or even probable that Mark Luedi knows of Mr. Stewart's
whereabouts, but since Mark has been silent for quite awhile, I'll welcome
hearing from him in any case.  I think someone else suggested that we
look for a ``Mike Stewart" who I don't personally recall.
If you are looking for Gregory Stewart and happen to find Mike Stewart,
that is good too and I'll give an additional bonus prize.
I have no idea whether Mike and Gregory Stewart ever had any relationship
to each other.
But I know we have some BIG Gregory Stewart fans around here.
While we're looking, I expect some of you to write about him 
for print to generate more interest.
Fifty bucks for finding him before the deadline for issue 240.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com or johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
I've mixed John's and Ronald's words up below....
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Ronald Camstra, siedler of zonnet.nl,
My home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. In that case I can see the name and
address of the sender in my bankreceipt, so people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
So if I have a UK buyer of my program, I tell him to send a check of
three pounds to John Harrington, 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield,
Middlesex, EN1 3UW, with a order code like `Settlers UK-2000-61' and
their email address?

<p>
John: If he's a UK buyer he can send a cheque, 
if he's American he can send a check :-)
<i>((Over the years, this has been an eternal and never-ending series
of chuckles..... yeah, I know, cheap thrills.))</i>
An order code probably won't be necessary unless it is useful for your 
records.

Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Begins!!

<p>
``The World Masters Email Diplomacy Championship has become a primary event
on the Dip Calendar (last years was the LARGEST ever Diplomacy event in the
world with 553 players and 79 teams!!)"

<p>
Worldmasters2000 is now ready to start accepting  players. Get together with
seven friends and form a team, or enter as an individual.

<p>
The main WWW site for Worldmasters will link you to automated signup forms,
news, history, rules and help answer your questions.

<p>

<p>
Sign up for the conference board at

<p>
http://webforum.cloud-nine.com/&#126; worldmasters2000

<p>
The Conference board is where day to day communications and discussions will
take place.

<p>
We have a special fund raising effort under way to take advantage of the
free $5 signup that Paypals is giving out to new accounts. It is limited to
US residents at this time. If we can get a few hundred people to sign up we
can get a nice fund set up to cover the postage for sending prizes all over
the world. WM Home link above will guide you to the proper explanations.

<p>
Worldmasters 1999 had 553 players on 79 teams. We are well into the semi
final round of 49 players and hope to start the final board with seven
sharks on or about October 1st. Follow the action from the WM99 Finals page.

<p>

<p>
We are also beginning the process of having top teams and players select the
prizes they have earned so they can be sent out. News of this will be
displayed on the WM Home site.

<p>

Hi Jim,

Got the two mails below on Friday.  I don't see any reason you can't
captain a team yet not GM, as long as someone on the team does GM.
Personally I'm sure I'm up to GMing again either.  The only requirement
per last round was one GM per team (we fielded 4, so I think we did
our share).

I am finally ready to begin WM2000.
First, lets get this out of the way. The only way we can do prizes and send 
them all over the world it to put in a token entry fee. Entry fee will be $5.
My decision, so you can bitch to me if you want.

<p>
WWW site is up.
http://worldmasters00.diplomacy.org.uk

<p>
Not everything is done, but enough to keep you busy. 

<p>
1. HR are posted for examination

<p>
2. Scoring format is posted for examination

<p>
3. Team signup is automated and ready to use

<p>
4. Individual signup will be automated but not ready yet.

<p>
5. Details and links for the DPjudge Conference board.

<p>
http://webforum.cloud-nine.com/&#126; worldmasters2000

<p>
Created a couple topics to start off with. This Webforum seems much faster than
the one we have now. 

<p>
Important!! We will need people! 

<p>
1. Need people to sit on the Tournament Management Committee and people who 
would like to take spots as Assistant Tournament Directors. Also, if any would 
really like the TD spot. I would be delighted to hand that off.

<p>
2. Need people spread around the world to help handle entry fee collection for 
those who cannot use Credit Cards. 

<p>
3. Need another handful of people to act as monitors for conferences to answer
questions for people who wander in clueless and with questions.

<p>
4. Need some people to work on publicity so the work can be spread out.

<p>
You can contact me directly, or I will have conferences on the new board where 
people can leave names and ideas.

<p>
First, please FORGET talk about entry fees just at the moment. An interesting
idea has been brought forth. 
Seems a useful service on the Web called Paypals is offering $5 to everyone
who signs up with them. No strings, no purchase required, just $5 for signing
up. It's limited to US residents but perhaps we can use this to get Paypals
to, in effect, pump a few hundred bucks into the piggy bank. 

<p>
Second, I urge everyone to please register on the new conference board. We
will start to phase this one out.
http://webforum.cloud-nine.com/&#126; worldmasters2000
 
<p>
http://masters00.diplomacy.org.uk

<p>
Greetings all,

<p>
A month and a half ought to get you over WDC, and it's time to play Dip
again!  If you're anywhere near the Boston area (or would like to be)
come on by and join us for the 14th running of Diplomatic Incident.
Lots of Diplomacy and other gaming, a fun housecon setting and a good
time for all.  If you publish, then I'd appreciate your spreading the
word if you have an issue coming out before the end of September.  
If you want to come but need crash space, 
drop me a line and we'll work something out.

<p>
Directions are below:

<p>
Contact: Dave Partridge  rebhuhn of rocketmail.com  603-886-1400 x212

<p>
Date:  September 30, October 1, 2000; we start around 11AM each day!

<p>
Location: 12 Yarmouth St, Boston, MA

<p>
Nearest T: BackBay Station on the Orange line or Copley Square Station on
the Green line.

<p>
From either:
Exit the station to Dartmouth St. Walk to Columbus St. (1/2 block to the
left from BackBay Station, or 2 blocks past the Copley Plaza Hotel from
Copley Square Station). Go right on Columbus St. Make the next right onto
Yarmouth St.  We're mid way down the block on the left.

<p>
Parking: Good luck. There are several garages in the square block bounded by
Dartmouth St., St. James St., Clarendon St. and Columbus Ave. (BackBay Station
is inside that block, for those of you without a map :-)) All are expensive,
but not as bad as a ticket and tow by Boston's Finest. The garage at Copley
Place Mall (St. James &amp; Exeter, beneath the Marriott Hotel) is only a block
further away and the shops inside the mall validate. To get to the games,
just wander around inside the Mall until you find the ``Dartmouth St/ BackBay
Station" exit - its at the Neiman Marcus end. If you can't figure things out
from there, you shouldn't be playing Diplomacy...

Some First Thoughts and Results from World DipCon - Baltimore</td></table><!--hboxt-->

by Jim-Bob Burgess</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
For the ``bottom liners" here are the top finishers in this 
past weekend's World DipCon tournament in Baltimore:

<p>
Winner, plus Best Italy and Best England: Simon Bouton of the UK

<p>
2nd place, plus Best France: Brian Dehnehy of Ireland

<p>
3rd place: Matt ``Chirchill'' Shields (97 points - I lost track of the two top
point finishers as I was scribbling frantically)

<p>
4th place, plus Best Germany: ``Blue" (otherwise known as Sean Cable)
(97 points - that's what I had, so he must have lost a tie breaker,
but I'm not sure)

<p>
5th place: Jon Evers (80 points)

<p>
6th place: Yardin Livnat (currently of Salt Lake City, but Israeli)
(75 points)

<p>
7th place, plus Best Austria: Vick Hall of the UK - note how many
foreign high finishers there were since Blue is also a foreigner
and I'm not sure about Evers and Shields. (71 points)

<p>
Best Russia was Nathan Cockerill and Best Turkey was Mark Franceschini

<p>
And the brilliant Chris Martin didn't do Jack..... except remember
very badly the final results - I took careful notes.  ;-)

<p>
There were 149 total participants (short of the record, but damned
good - probably the best accumulation of raw diplomatic talent
in the hobby in history though as very few players were novices).

<p>
John Quarto von Tivadar played a little of the tournament (against
his better judgment since he hates the draw voting system - more
on that below), but he WON the Escalation Dip variant tournament,
showing that he really is one of the (if not the) best tactictians
in the world.

<p>
The special Edi Birsan ``49er" award for finishing 49th went to
Mike Hall.

<p>
And guess who finished all four rounds with FOUR eliminations?
Yes, it was Tim Miller!   He discovered how ``different" FTF 
tournament Dip is from E-Mail dip in the most painful way 
possible, but at least he got a neat plaque!!

<p>
The ``Crying Towel" award in Saturday's team championship went
to the team of David Norman, Rick Desper, Greg Geyer, and Ray
Setzer.  Manus was supposed to be on this team (in place of
Geyer?), but he OVERSLEPT!!!  And even after the tournament
director made extra efforts to find Manus' hotel and call him,
he still didn't make it..... boo hiss.... actually it was 
quite a grueling schedule.  Anyway, the Crying Towel award
really was for the LOWEST team score (only 3 lousy points!).

<p>
The ``Best Asians" team won the Team Championship with UK
based Asian expatriates: Gihan Bandaranaike, Chetan Radia,
Simon Bouton, and Vic Hall!  These are four GREAT players
with LOTS of FTF experience.  They has 71 points total.

<p>
The ``Wicked Old Men" finished second with 66, but 
this was a bit deceptive, as 61 points
of those were for a brilliant win by John Smythe!  I think
these guys are all over 60.  Edi Birsan, Mike Rocamora, and
Chuck Liebernauer were the others.  Edi contributed no points.
but was bragging a lot.  ;-)

<p>
The Scott Morris led ``Flat Earth Society" team just nosed out MY 
team with 44 points (tied for 7th).  My Malice in Underhand team
(we had great T-Shirts designed by Don Williams' wife - mine 
had a picture of Alice with a knife and my ``Boob" nickname)
finished 8th with 41 points.  Steve Emmert and Charles Steinhardt
were the other members of the team (Steinhardt filling in for
Mark Fassio who had to leave because of a family illness).

<p>
More later perhaps on how I did personally, but I played a great
final game to pull out a decent placing - only Buz Eddy knows
all the results for sure, he took them, so I don't even know 
where I placed - middle of the pack though.  I was in Simon
Bouton's winning English game as Austria and TRIED desperately
to get everyone to realize that they needed to stop Simon 
rather than wiping me out, but Ken Mathias was getting killed
as France and David Norman as Russia was fighting Adam Silverman's
Turkey and Ray Setzer in Germany couldn't stop Simon alone!
I dropped from 5 to 1 while England and Turkey each were going
from 5 to 9 (over two game years) but it was clear that Simon
was going to get the best of it over Adam.  Adam (who also is
a New England local who I know well) will learn for next time!

<p>
I got off to a bad start in the first game by not studying the
tournament draw system closely enough.  I played Italy to a 
5 center final position but was excluded from what was declared
a four way draw at the closing bell on the tie breaker - highest
average center count as Italy I lost to Russia who also had 
five centers, but draws had to include a minimum of 29 centers
voting for the proposal.  This made the line between five and 
six centers crucial AND unbalanced to manage.  It accentuates
the difficulties of countries like Italy trying to play a good
balance of power game.  Quarto warned me I would hate it, and
he understated how much I did.  Oh well, I learned in how to
be PART of a four way in the last game as Austria.

<p>
AND, last but not least:

<p>
Chris Kulander won the Stab of the Tournament award for taking
a Russia position from 7 centers to 13 centers in one year from
four different neighbors!

<p>
I will add to this later, undoubtedly, but this is a quick look
at the Numbers, not the people.  Corrections are welcome.

Chris  Kulander (not Colander), nicknamed ``Ku", won the Golden Blade

We had to settle for players from ten nations: USA, Canada, UK, Ireland,

American Rick Desper has played from Holland and Germany the last couple
of years.

Tthe new World Diplomacy Champion's name is Simon Bouton.  Congratulations
to Simon.  Simon was also part of the Championship Team, Best Asians
(their name, not an award), which also included Chetan Radia, Gihan
??? (sorry), and ??? ??? (doubly sorry).
<i>((Simon is a really, really good player in my not unique opinion.
I got the details on the team above correct....))</i>

<p>
I myself got 2 3-way draws and a 4-way draw, which I think ended up
placing me in the top 25 or so,  I'll have to ask David Norman.
I had one really bad game, which unfortunately happened in the team
round, where I ended up with a 3-center Germany excluded from the draw.
Worse, all three of my teammates were eliminated, so we finished with
three points as our team score, and won the ``Crying Towel" award.  :)
A nadir for Team Internet, which as recently as two years ago won
the Team Championship itself.

<p>
For me, the important points were meeting Brandon Clarke and two of the
leading Irish players, Brian Dennehy and Fearghal D. for the first time
(I had met most of the European players at Namur or Manorcon),
seeing a lot of old faces, meeting some more postal players I had not met
before, like Mike Barno and Don Williams, and generally having a lot of
fun.

<p>
The business meeting was somewhat contentious as we discussed the new
World Dipcon charter.  In spite of the fact that this charter had been
discussed extensively beforehand, many people came to the meeting with
new complaints about the procedure.  In particular, Xavier Blanchot
raised an objection to the idea that the charter voted on in the US
should be accepted by everybody.  As currently constructed, the charter
defines three zones: US and Canada, European and Mediterranean, and Oceania
(Australia and New Zealand).  Thankfully, Brandon come up with an
acceptable proposal, that the charter will include each region only after
a vote in that region.  The charter passed by a comfortable margin in the
American region, and will be voted on again next year in Paris and the
year after in Canberra.

<p>
<i>((I have just a few things to say about this meeting.
First of all, the ``fun'' part.
Don Williams and I looked up at one point to see a long line of Lawyers standing
at the back of the room together, including Steve Emmert, Carl Adamec,
and Mark Franceschini, but there were others too, I think.
Hilarious.... one well-placed bomb....
Also, as I mentioned above, another highlight was Robert Sacks' impassioned
defense of the Charter.
Not because it was perfect, as Edi Birsan readily admitted, but because it
was time to stop arguing over a hard fought compromise document.
I still saw a great deal of Iain Bowen's spirit in the document (and since
I might be the only Dip publisher with him still on my sub list, let me
say ***HI, IAIN!!!***) and this reminded me all too much of the World DipCon
Society meeting that Iain ran in 1994 (?) where Xavier Blanchot made almost
precisely the same speech, word for word.
Not even seeming to realize the incongruity of it when the Americans were
voting of their own free will to send the World DipCon to 
Canberra, Australia for 2002, with no US group choosing to bid against them.          
In theory, it could be held out of the US for quite some time that way
and rendered one of Xavier's arguments (that the US would grab it every two years
like clockwork and that was not fair) as totally absurd and patently incorrect.
This was far more contentious than it needed to be and I, for one, want to
congratulate Edi Birsan personally for handling it so well, if not as quickly
as EVERYONE would have liked.
A few of the speakers also were slightly inebriated.
Unfortunately, the anarchic nature of our hobby practically demands 
we both allow such spectacles and that they will occur.
I hope with all my heart that this is the end of it and that it gets
by Paris next year, but I am not that hopeful and I don't really
mind who hears that.
What is unfair is having people work hard on things in this hobby
and then have other people, who have the opportunity and are even
solicited to do some of that work, dump on the final result.
Nuff said from here.))</i>

<p>
The biggest disappointment was the relatively large number of no-shows
by international players, in particular the Swedes.  I had looked forward
to seeing Christian Dreyer attempt to defend his title, and to seeing
Leif Bergman and others again.  I heard rumors about a travel agent who
ran off with their money - I hope we find out just what happened, as a
World Championship without any Swedes is certainly missing something
important.  I did play a game with one Norwegian, Frank Johansen, 
and he annoyingly conspired with Jim Burgess in the first round
to prevent Don Williams and myself from getting either a 2-way EF or a
three way with Turkey.  
<i>((Hey, Rick, that's the name of the game, what I thought was worse
was me being EXCLUDED from that draw by the rules....))</i>
Other exotic foreign cultures represented
included Belgium, France, England, Ireland, Israel, Canada, Luxembourg
(sort of), and Carolina.

<p>
Seven clipboards were handed out to the seven players who had travelled
the furthest.  To my chagrin, my flight from Frankfurt was ignored, as
Edi Birsan said ``you're one of us" and gave clipboards to Jean-Louis
Delattre from Belgium and Yann Clouet who complained to me about his
new living quarters in Luxembourg.  (I'm not seriously complaining here,
BTW).

<p>
I am hoping that I can get to Paris next year for WDC XI, and perhaps
even make the flight a week earlier so I can also get to Manorcon.
I am also really hoping I can get Down Under for WDC XII.

<p>
On the whole, a great weekend, with a huge number (149) of Dippers,
including many great players.  It was a blast.

<p><br><p><br> <b>Tim Miller (7 Aug 2000 00:51:26 GMT)</b>

<p>
WDC X is now over, and I am pleased to report that I came back from my
first ever FtF Con with an award - OK, so it was the ``I got hammered"
award, but an award is an award by my way of thinking :-).

<p>
Anyhow, I didn't write down the winners, but the championship was taken
by the European champ Simon Bouton. 

<p>
Anyhow, here's my path to the ``Hammered" award:

<p>
Round 1: My first ever real serious FtF game, and I get to face Grand
Prix champ and ex world champ Chris Martin (England), Hobby Legend Edi
Birsan (France), Israeli Dipper Shlomi Yaakobovich (Turkey), and ex
champ Mike Rocamora (Russia) on my board. I was Austria and Ry4an
Brase was Germany while Grant Flowers was Italy. Goody. I first tried to
ally with Shlomi against Mike, but wavered a bit on letting Shlomi grow
too much, and got indecisive. Eventually, with Mike running scared in
the south, I tried to switch gears against Shlomi, but Grant came up
with a wicked stab, and I was out. Mantra of the round ``Shlomi, you must
trust Shlomi." Chris, Edi, Shlomi, and a revived Mike shared a four way.

<p>
Round 2: I drew England. Allied with Al (forget last name) the German
and gave Chris Kulander (Russia) some major worries in the north (he
moved north). Unfortunately because of this and an Italian move to Tyr
Steve (again forget last name, will try to update this tomorrow since I
should have the last names written down, but am too tired to get them)
as France picked up 3 and went after Al and I with Russia. We eventually
made peace with Russia, but it was too late, and we were both eaten.

<p>
Round 3: I draw Turkey. Try to open neutral. Too neutral for my
neighbors, apparently, as Austria, Italy, and Russia all start throwing
units my way. I'm gone by the end of 1903. Talk about the quick
evisceration of a witch. This probably sealed my ``hammered" award as I
went from 3 to 0 in one year. Ouch!

<p>
Round 4: I draw England again. This time, events seem to be in my favor
as I gain Bel and Nwy in '01, and St. Pete's from a sinking Russian in
'02. By then I was confident, and wanted to take out France, so I
stabbed brutally in fall '02. Unfortunately, my brain takes a holiday on
the subsequent build phase, and I build to kill France quick, not to
protect the North Sea (now vacant) from Germany. I had read him as
worried about France, but I left myself wide open, and he stabbed hard.
I hung on to '07 working with France as virtually one power, but got
killed. The game ended in a TG two-way.

<p>
I had a lot of fun despite my dismal showing. After this experience, I
definitely want to play more FtF. It has a totally different dynamic
than e-mail, one that favors quick action and often quick kills (this
was brought on by the scoring system). Unfortunately, this made Austria
a big target, and I saw her out or in serious trouble in about 66% of
the games.

<p>
These cons are a great experience to meet hobby legends like Edi Birsan
and Manus Hand (the only player I'd previously met in person). I met a
lot of folks from rgd, including the above and Rick Desper, Jim Burgess,
Grant Flowers, Ry4an Brase, Brandon Clarke (whose bid to host WDC 2002 in
Canberra succeeded unanimously), and others. It's also interesting to
watch the hobby politics get played out at the DipCon Society meeting.
Manus Hand made the successful bid to host the next North American
DipCon in Denver next February. The next World DipCon will be at the end
of July 2001 in beautiful Paris, France.

<p>
In short, I encourage all you e-mailers to get out and play some FtF.
Maybe we can form a team to play in Paris, though I'm not sure if I'll
personally be able to attend.

<p>
[Special WDC Report]

<p>
Never let it be said that The Benevolent Dictator fails to pay homage to the
authors of worthy achievements.  Our boy, Sean Cable, finished fourth in the
world this past weekend in Baltimore, racking up a solo victory as Germany,
which he assures me is not his best country, or even his second best.
Congratulations, Blue, on a marvelous showing in a very well-stocked
tournament.  An incredible number of extremely strong players attended,
lending all the more luster to the achievements of World Champion Simon
Bouton of the UK, who took home two Best Country prizes to go with the
overall first place finish.

<p>
I had the pleasure of seeing several Academicians at the con, as reported
elsewhere on this net.  Notably absent from the festivities was Laurie
Bentz-Cable, who not only stood up The Benevolent Dictator, she even stood
up her own husband, who had been counting on her for a ride home on Sunday.
I did get to meet Principles Chief Cartographer Tim Beaman, and have
decided to award him Laurie's position in Principles as punishment to her for
having neglected, failed, or refused to appear as promised.  Tim, if you'll
submit fall 1911 orders by the next deadline, I'll be sure to get you back in the
flow of the game.

<p>
The Benevolent Dictator, true to his stated purpose to attend the con for
social purposes only, played in but two rounds, thus failing to qualify for
any serious awards.  (Awards were based on your best three scores out of
four rounds.)  I managed a three-way draw as Austria in round 1, with
eleven dots, and a four-way draw as Russia in round 3, with ten.  The real
thrills of the con for me were meeting friends, greeting and thanking Allan
Calhamer for all the pleasure he's given me over the years, and having dinner on
Saturday evening in Little Italy.
<i>((And the most sincere thanks to Steve for inviting me to share that
Dinner with him, and most sincere apologies to him for holding up our arrival
at the restaurant trying not to miss the World DipCon Society Festivities
(or should that be abominations....).
We all DID miss Allan Calhamer's speech itself, but the value of Steve's
company even exceeds that of the Founder of the Feast.))</i>

<p>
Next year's Dipcon (American version) is in Denver; accordingly, the Vegas
bookmakers have installed Pat Charlton as the early favorite, despite his
aversion to playing FTF.  Next year's WDC will be in Paris, and after that,
it travels to Canberra, Australia in March 2002.  Hey, if everyone votes
provincially, we may never see another WDC in North America again; the rules
specify that the sites are selected two years in advance, at the WDC meeting
that is always held at WDC.  Hence the Parisians will, in all likelihood,
select a European site next year for 2003, and the Aussies may well decide
in 2002 to keep it in the southern hemisphere for 2004.  Canberra's bid was
helped considerably by two factors:  (1) They had a well-prepared
presentation, including a nice informative/lobbying brochure, and (2) there
were no other bidders.  (This is not to say that they would not have won if
there HAD been other bidders.  But as a trial lawyer, I know that my winning
percentage goes up significantly when my opponent declines to appear for
trial.)
<i>((This was not entirely a coincidence, as I noted above.
American bidders were discouraged as a magnanimous gesture to our
Down Under brothers that was supposed to deter arguments like those 
we observed.))</i>

<p>
For a more detailed report of the results of WDC, I highly recommend the
excellent postal zine <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>, published by the ever-humble
economist, Jim Burgess (who also happened to be my teammate in the team
round last weekend).  He will probably publish his report in the next week
and a half or so.  His zine is available online at:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP

<p>
Some of you Philistines who have yet to experience the wonders of the postal
hobby would probably benefit from a visit to Jim-Bob's site.  I will not
attempt to coerce you into doing so; as Dorothy said about horticulture,
``You can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think."  If you want to
remain a Philistine, you may do so and continue an unfulfilled life.  But if
I did not at least point out the way to greater happiness, I wouldn't be
known as - The Benevolent Dictator

Probably better that I didn't show; I'm sure I would've ended up in a
Birsan-like abused mode, and cost the team points.
 
<p>
Got a lot of nice e-mail from folks I briefly met Thu night AND found out
that both Judas and Duck played in a game with Mike French, aka ``Frenchy"
the Austrian in my e-Tourney.  Frenchy had good words for you both (the
fool), and just eliminated himself rather than walk unopposed into Paris.
(This is known as ``The Emmert Opening," of course.)  Frenchy saw my team
rapidly climbing the charts and, rather than ``aid" me and my team, killed
himself to hurt us by helping the #2 team.

<i>((Nonsense, Marcus!!  We missed you big time.  Good to hear your parents
are doing better!
As for Mike French, I was in that First Round game with Duck too and
Mike played Turkey to my Italy.  We wiped out Austria together
(against Duck's better judgement, but I REALLY had no choice as
Alan Witte was not one of the tournament's better players and I
couldn't trust him or manipulate him).  I will have MUCH more to
say about this game elsewhere in the szine.))</i>

Here's a mailing I just got with full WDC results.  Jim-Bob finished with 15
points (tied with Birsan!), while Don had 34 and I had 35.  But HE gets
listed among the noble souls, while *I* am among the Untouchables at the
bottom of the page, since I didn't play in three rounds.  (Sigh.)  This is
the price of loyalty to one's family, I suppose.

<p>
By the way, der Wunderkind, Steinhardt (aka the pseudoFaz), played four
times and got 27 points.  Evidently he offended nearly everyone he played
with.

<i>((A few quick comments on certain individuals and awards on the list by me:
First, I count only 139 contestants.
That is still a helluva lot, but it seems to me that it could have been much,
much more.
Also Mike Hall, the ``49er'', looks like he was really 47th, unless they counted the
``non-qualifiers like Emmert, but then Ray Setzer should have been 49th and
Mike Hall 50th.
Five on the first board and six of the Top 10 were foreigners.
Don Scheifler, an old postal hobby stalwart who hasn't been seen much around our
parts lately, finishes tenth.
Great to meet him after all these years.
The Irishmen were uniformly just loads of fun to be around, precisely as I had expected.
Gihan Bandaranaike finished 12th and I was directly responsible for his elimination
in the fourth round.
I didn't go into the game with the intent to eliminate him, but I ***DID*** go into
the game with the determined intent to get my only draw of the tournament.
Frank Johansen, who also was a first round ally and finished tied for 23rd
with Tom Pasko (who it was good to meet again after many, many years), was
my game long ally in that game to good effect.
To be fair or maybe not, Gihan was either a bit drunk, hungover or both, but
it still was fun to match wits with him for awhile, before stabbing the heck
out of him!
Then I gave him the beer I had promised him (I might have even done better had
I given it to him earlier!!))

<p>
((Rick Desper, Grant Flowers, and Mark Franceschini all finished tied for 20th.
Some good players in that group!
The group tied at 29th: Chris Kulander, Chris Martin, Doug Faust,
Shlomi Yaakobovich, and Mark Wightman also was notable, though I don't know Doug.
The Chrises pulled off two of the biggest stabs of the tournament.
Kulander's was described above and Chris Martin ruined Larry Peery's possible
best tournament showing in decades (Larry was Russia and Chris was Turkey
in Round 3, Board 2) just after I came over and kibitzed a first class jinxing
on Larry by saying he was doing well beating the great and powerful Chrissie poo.
Shlomi (who I played against in my Worldmasters tournament game last winner)
was the only person who brought a companion who followed him around the whole
tournament.
She must have been bored to tears....
and of course Mark is one of the UK's greatest pubbers.
The estimable Don Williams tied with the equally estimable Manus Hand (who will
be hosting US DipCon next year in Denver) at 39th.
Phil Reynolds finished 53rd and wins my personal all-time award for dipper who
who looked precisely as I imagined he would look!
I saw him across the room and said: ``that has to be Phil Reynolds" and it was.
Of course, this usually does not happen and I even frequently have trouble
reconciling the facts with my images.
Hair color always is one of these, as I had to reminded again of how light Rick
Desper's hair color is.
I recognize him each time I see him, but I always imagine his hair being much
darker and can't change my mental image.))

<p>
((The group that tied for 56th also is highly notable!
First and foremost, my younger brother David beat me by six points....
but he also was tied with the Founder of the Feast, Allan Calhamer!
I didn't get much time to talk to him, but it was great to have him
part of this event.
Robert Vollman played Germany to my Austria in that Fourth Round game
where I trounced Gihan and allied with Frank Johansen's Russia.
Poor William Fuller (who finished 83rd and lost all of his games) was
the unfortunate Turkey among all of these sharks.
I really, really enjoyed playing with Robert in this game as he was a 
careful, patient negotiator who was looking to learn from all of these
sharks.
He also had lost his first three games and pulled out that last draw
and finished ahead of me.
Last, but certainly not least, we have Mike Barno, who is also a close
friend of my brother David, so it is quite fitting that they were tied.))

<p>
((Coming in 60th, was my very first hobby postal GM, Carl Adamec.
He and I went to high school together and now he is one of those
aforementioned lawyers, practicing in our old hometown.
Carl and I went up against each other in Round 3, his Italy to my
France.
That game also featured Ray Setzer as the Austrian.
I was knocked out of that one after trying to attack Ric Manns' England,
but being seriously betrayed by an opportunistic Hugh Turner in Germany
(playing his only game of the Tournament).
It was neat that Edi Birsan and I finished tied for 68th, just ahead of
Rex Martin, with Edi getting his draw in the first game and I in the 
last.
And just behind that was Ry4an Brase, who it was good to finally meet
after all these years of interacting over the Showcase at the Diplomatic
Pouch.
Ry4an also pulled out a draw in his Fourth Round game.
Then just below that was the top (especially in size) postal pubber 
in the British hobby at the moment, Malcolm Cornelius.
I really wanted to spend more time talking to him than I did, since we share
this burden of trying to keep very large postal szines sailing along on
schedule.
Only the small number of people who have done this, know just what that is like.
Still, clearly we both still enjoy it!))

<p>
((Finally, Tim Miller managed to beat Larry Peery out for the Hammered award, and
deservedly so.
I really enjoyed meeting Tim too and keeping up with his progress, or 
lack of it, throughout the entire tournament.
It was good to see that Tim had the right attitude, leaping up in delight when
his Hammered award was announced.
Of course, I had been checking on Peery as well, and knew he had picked up
the single point that Tim lacked, so I was pretty sure that Tim had ``won''.
Poor Joe Carl (who is at least a name I see in the US postal scene) tied
Larry for second to last place.
Well, that's about enough of the stats.
Let's go back to some comments, but first, in case you're confused by
the notation.....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Chris Mann (Fri Aug 11 15:58:37 2000)</b>

<p>
Rick, Could you explain the notation for us newbies?

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Fri, 11 Aug 2000 17:58:02 GMT)</b>

<p>
Well, the notation consists of
(D/L/W)(board#)(Power)
for example, in my fourth round game I have D2E, as I played on
board 2, and was part of the draw as England.

<p>
Missing from this notation is both the number of participants in the
draw and the number of SCs owned.  As these two points of information
determine the score entirely, I could see where the results would
be viewed with confusion.

<p>
See http://diplom.org/Face/results/WDC10.html

<p>
What sticks out immediately is that the British and Irish romped.
Top team, overall winner, runner-up, and half of top 12 (if we
believe that Sean ``Blue" Cable is British).

<i>((The big thing for me at this tournament/convention was the chance to
be part of the ``Malice in Underhand'' crew.

(What a lame excuse.  Badminton trumps Diplomacy - why, da noive o' dat
guy!)

<p>
Baltimore was, well, a bit lonelier than it should have been, in one
important sense.  Mark's father was admitted to the hospital Thursday
evening, so Mark left first thing Friday morning to go to Pennsylvania.  We
all hoped he could get back before the tournament ended, but he didn't
return until Sunday afternoon, after which it was all over but the rides to
the airport.

<p>
But Don, Jim-Bob, and I muddled through.  Those two played three or four
rounds apiece, and I played in but two.  I got into a three-way as Austria
(eleven dots) and a four-way as Russia (ten).  (This continues my streak -
for which I have no credible explanation - of never having been eliminated
in a FTF game, tournament or otherwise.)  I'll allow Don and Jim to describe
their triumphs in their own words, but according to Jim-Bob, Malice in
Underhand finished eighth.

<p>
Dinner on Saturday at Da Mimmo was fabulous.

<p>
The juleps were received favorably, I think; I'll let Don and Jim describe
what recollections they might still have, distorted as those may be through
the twin shrouds of time and intoxication.
<i>((They really were masterful and between us, Don and I drank an
entire bottle of booze over the weekend, with little or no help from Steve!

To me the pewter cups were the key, that got really, really cold.

The DUCK has landed.  In spite of wretched weather, the soggy plane
lumbered and lurched off the ground only an hour late.  In one of those
good news/bad news things, I had a window seat and sat next to a
semi-attractive member of the opposite sex.  Bad news was that she was
five hours worth of chatty, weighed (I swear) no less than 295 lbs, and
does Medicare billing fraud analysis ... sohepmeGhod ...

Miriam may have liked Fassio best, but it was one of those father-figure
things, him being the greybeard of our little group.  We'll just see
who's email she shows up on, eh?

<p>
Wasn't going to bring this up, but seeing as that ``lousy tipper" crack
has already made it's way into our post-weekend pronouncements ... 
<i>((This was the Thursday night dinner between Fassio, Emmert, Williams,
and the Boob at the local Outback after they all picked me up at the 
Baltimore airport.
Fassio and Emmert practically had our waitress (who is about to move to
SoCal) moving in with the Duck so..... well, she SAID she had a boyfriend....
and then, and then, we left it to the Duck to ``select'' the amount of 
the tip.))</i>
I'll put it down to the two (HUGE CANS OF) Fosters that I miscalculated the
tip; I was rounding and thought I'd left 17%;  I was not aware 15% is
considered ``lousy".  20% might have been appropriate but I wasn't
thinking - whatever, I wasn't really trying to shave $5 off the dinner
bill, honest.  Steve, all, let me thank you for helping me - with $10
- to look like a cheap fool, and feel like a putz and a shitheel, for
picking up dinner.  And doing it with fanfare.
<i>((Indeed..... admittedly, some of this is probably an East Coast urban
thing.  The standard in my necks of the woods these days is that you leave
15-20% most of the time.  What I usually do is figure out precisely what
15% is and then round up someplace that fits my wallet, the service, 
and my mood.
I sense as I travel a lot, that these East Coast urban habits are not shared
across the country.
Plus, I am someone who eats out a lot, probably a helluva lot, occasionally
every night in a given week, so I am very comfortable.
All these are excuses for the Duck..... he just was trying to keep the
Waitress out of his future life!))</i>

(Hope the minivan's transmission is back up to snuff).  Steve, thanks
again for a dinner I won't soon forget, and thanks for the rides through

Basically, at WDC any coalition that held 29 supply centers could
dictate the draw, voting in or out anyone that they pleased. If the game
ended, and the surviving players could not agree on a draw that had 29
centers behind it, then the GM would determine the draw. He would do
this by taking the largest power, then the next largest, etc. until he
had a coalition with 29 centers. If two equally sized powers were ties
for the smallest power able to get into such a coalition, then the GM
would average the number of centers the powers had each year, and whichever 
power had the higher average was in the draw.

<p>
An example, suppose at game end we have: 

<p>
Russia: 11 centers

<p>
Turkey: 9 centers

<p>
France: 8 centers

<p>
England: 3 centers

<p>
Italy: 3 centers

<p>
Suppose that these 5 players can't agree on a draw with 29 centers
behind it. The GM would find that RTF had 28 centers between them, but
he would need either E or I to get a coalition with more than 29
centers. Both are equally sized, so he looks at average number of supply
centers, which let's suppose is as follows:

<p>
 <table><tr><td width=50>
 End of year: </td><td width=50>
</td><td width=50>

<p>
In this case, England gets in the draw since she had a higher average
number of centers (4.75) at the end of each year than Italy (3.75). So
the result would be a RFTE four way, excluding Italy.

It was a fantastic con. I really enjoyed it.  It did not seem as well

I couldn't get more than a 3 way and 4 way but I never got eliminated so I'll 
take it!  I suspect you need a real chump on your table to get a solo.  Also 
I've got a bone to pick with the organizers on the team concept, My team 
drew, Italy, Italy, Italy and Austria. We had no chance.  LOL.  Despite that 
handicap we had two 3 ways and one 4 way and one elimination.  However all 
our draws were with lose center counts.

I had a great time at World DIPCON.  Are the full results posted on the net
anywhere?  Mike Barno sent me the top 7 or so...
<i>((See above....))</i>
I'm sad to say I didn't play
with any of them.  I haven't played nearly enough dip in the past few years
and it showed.  Well, I'll just have to do better next time.  Realistically,
that will be 10 years from now.  I do think I'm going to try to get to some
CON next year.  I did meet a lot of good people.  I should have had two
3-way draws instead of 4-way draws, if the games had lasted another 5
minutes.  The last game I should have had a two way, but I missed one order
and it really screwed up the outcome.  Russia was allowed to retreat to one
of my open centers and keep in the game 1 year longer.  C'est la vie!  I'm
going to get Phil Reynolds' szine and join one of his variant games.
(WOW...that is a rambling paragraph!)

Survivor update: I knew Colleen was going to get it after Sean invited
Richard for breakfast on the ship.  I have this sinking feeling it's going
to be Richard and Susan for the final 2 and I don't want either of them to
win.  I hope Rudy wins, he's been quietly keeping in the game without
annoying anyone.  I think survivor 2 will be more fun that this one.  It
will be more cut-throat because everyone will know what they are getting
themselves into this time.

Well, I have an interesting story. 
We were on the same table for the gunboat game. 
He was playing England, and I was Russia.  England opens Northward and
then in fall 1901, mis-wrote the Army's convoy order to Norway!! :)  We
figured, if anyone would know how to write the order, certainly he would so
there wasn't a heck of a lot of ``slack" the way one might be with a newbie
whose intent was clear but who'd mis-written the order. Other than breathing
a sigh of relief as Russia, I thought the incident was kinda cute. He is a
LOT more fun to talk with one-on-one rather than in a group, since you pick
up on a lot of the soft-spoken gems he lets fly. And just goes to show that
anyone can make a mistake anytime so you should always play in such a way
that *allows* your opponent to make a mistake :)   In the end we voted for a
6way since we weren't have nearly the fun as the other tables which were
well into their stripping phase while we were playing a much-too-serious
game :)

Calhamer did autograph my copy of the 1958 board so I was majorly, majorly

Dear David - Thanks for your detailed reply on this topic.  

<p>
We apparently disagree only on the definition of ``out of game" conduct, and
neither of us would want to play with a complete crook.  Nor do I think
Harry is a crook; I would cheerfully buy him a beer and talk about this or
any other aspect of Dip.  I just think he has engaged in a certain amount of
bridge-burning that I don't feel I could afford to do.  He has lied about
something that most of us wouldn't think of fabricating, and that very
difference (the fact that he has gone beyond what the vast majority of other
players would do themselves) is what will ultimately cost him here.  Lying
about one's intentions regarding Galicia?  Virtually everyone does that at
one time or another.  Lying about one's draw vote?  Maybe a few people would
have qualms about that, but most would regard that as integral to the game.
Lying about who you are?  Now I think you're getting into an area where most
people wouldn't tread.

<p>
As long as people measure other players' conduct against what they
themselves would do, there's a danger to pushing the envelope.

<p>
One digression about credibility, one of my favorite topics.  I have been
trained as a speaker since I was fourteen years old, and am now a
professional arguer of sorts (a trial lawyer).  I learned long ago that the
Greeks categorized three types of appeals that a speaker could make to an
audience:  Pathos (an emotional appeal), logos (an appeal to logic), and
ethos (an appeal based on the personal credibility of the speaker).  I have
long considered which of these three is the most persuasive.  At first I
thought it would be logos, but for many years now I have been firmly
convinced that ethos is far and away the most valuable type of attack.  For
example, suppose you got three different versions of a given fact.  One came
from the Star Trek character Spock, who may be said to embody logic.  One
comes from Jesse Jackson, who, regardless of whether you agree with his
politics, you must concede is a masterful wielder of emotional appeals.  The
third comes from Walter Cronkite, ``the most trusted man in America."  If you
had to decide just based on that, Walter would win damn near every time.  No
one, NO ONE would believe that he would lie to them.  What a powerful weapon
for a persuader.

<p>
It is this lesson that shapes my approach to Dip.  (Take notes here; this is
the way to beat me.)  I generally do whatever I can to develop credibility
with other players in a game.  Sure, you're going to lie to the guy you're
about to stab.  But it makes no sense to lie to others, as you will surely
reap more in eventual rewards if those players believe, as the game
progresses, that you're honest.  And that, in turn, is why I would never
take such a chance (faking my identity) with my own credibility, since it
has such a capacity to wreck my credibility all throughout the hobby.

<p>
David, let me close by responding that I am, indeed, very glad that you do
not take offense at this.  I am in no position to burn bridges when it comes
to making friends - no matter how many you have, there's always room for
more, and I would be very pleased to buy YOU one of those beers some day
soon.  Very best wishes.

Dear Steve,

<p>
First of all, I'd be happy to take you up on that beer, and to offer
one in return, but as I don't get to travel for Diplomacy that means
I'll have to entice you up to Diplomatic Incident one of these times.
Are you ever in the Boston area?

<p>
As to the rest of what you say, it's well reasoned and in fact I 
almost 100%!  The only thing I don't agree about is that playing
under an assumed identity in a Dip game in some way impairs one's
ethos.   I know that it has not done so for Harry as far as I'm 
concerned, and I do not think that it has done so as far as the
majority of those in the hobby.  I admit I'm making a leap here without
data to back me up, but it's my impression that this is the case.

<p>
The reason again comes down to context.  Harry pulled a great victimless
practical joke, and in that context using a false identity is not, in
my view, dishonest, and so has no adverse affect on how I perceive
his character.  Had he done so for some other reason I'd agree with you
completely.

<p>
Dear Jim-Bob -
I am overdue in responding to David Partridge's thoughtful discussion of the
subject of Harry Andruschak's ruse.  As I see it, David raises several key
points:

<p>
1.  ``Harry did nothing illegal."  (I'm paraphrasing for brevity, but that
is, I think, the substance.)  I agree that nowhere in the rule book does it
say you can't pretend to be of another gender.  Nor is something like that
likely to be found in the <i>TAP</i> house rules, or in any other house rules, for
that matter.  But that doesn't make it right.
<i>((Actually, this sort of deception is addressed, either implicitly or
explicitly in many sets of house rules.
It's not in mine though, intentionally.))</i>

<p>
In the context of an analogous topic (letter-passing), I have responded to
the ``it's not forbidden in the rule book" argument as follows:  We play by a
set of unwritten rules, too, that prescribe certain bounds for our conduct.
The rule book does not forbid me to, for example, call the Austrian's wife
and tell her falsely that he's having an affair.  Wrecking someone's home
life can be a very effective way of diminishing his Diplomacy effectiveness,
and Calhamer did not see fit to forbid this tactic in the rule book.  But no
sane Dipper would do such a thing; if anyone did, he would likely be
unwelcome in virtually all Diplomacy circles, starting with mine.

<p>
2.  ``Harry didn't use the false identity improperly, e.g., by playing two
powers in one game."  Agreed, but again, that argument wins only if our
entire code of ethics is prescribed in the rule book.  There are those,
present company definitely included, who regard the entire concept of
falsifying one's identity as being fundamentally dishonest in a way that
transcends the normal degree of deception found in any given Dip game.  If
you tell me you won't go to Galicia at the beginning of the game and you go
there anyway, I'll laugh about it with you after the game over a beer.  (In
fact, I did just that after Round 3 in Hunt Valley on Saturday.)  But if you
begin the game by telling me you're someone other than your true identity,
I'll take offense at that as being beyond mere game-related deception.  

<p>
3.  ``This is an appropriate response to the natural cross-gaming in the
hobby."  Actually, as I understand Harry's explanation, he developed the
character in order to overcome a very different kind of reputation.  He had,
I understand, NMR'ed out of a number of games, and feared backlash for that
when he decided to reenter the hobby.  I do not condemn him overly for the
NMR's; life has the capacity to come crashing down on any of us, and while
resigning is always better than NMR'ing, it is understandable.  But instead
of approaching the problem honorably and with candor, such as by writing an
earnest letter to GM's, he chose the easier route of inventing a whole
person, thereby deceiving the whole hobby.  

<p>
In truth, I doubt that any of these responses will cause David, or those who
feel as he does, to seriously reexamine their views here.  Opinions like
these tend to have a lot of inertia, and are hard to change.  But the real
underpinning of my view is this:  Credibility matters, even in Diplomacy.
Everyone expects people to engage in deception within the game, and no one
(except the more glandular members of the hobby) takes offense at that.  But
deception outside the game is more costly to the deceiver.  I do not insist
that David agree with me on this point; I merely invite him to acknowledge
that there are lots of us who do, in fact, assess that cost against Harry.
And our opinion of this practice will definitely affect our play in any
future games in which Harry plays.  It doesn't mean I will automatically
attack Harry if we're neighbors; it means it will be much, much harder for
him to gain my trust, which is a byproduct of personal credibility.

<p>
And in the words of Dennis Miller, that's just my opinion; I could be wrong.

<p>
Hello Steve,
While all of the points that you mention below are ones that I support, they
do not represent the fundamental basis of our disagreement.  (And to be clear
from the start, I am saying that we disagree, not that you are wrong.  This
is purely a subjective matter and any opinion is valid.)

<p>
I'm in full agreement that taking play outside of the game (calling the
wife, etc.) is in appropriate.  Just as you I would not welcome someone who
tried any of the tactics you mention.  Where we disagree is in finding
``the entire concept of falsifying one's identity as being fundamentally 
dishonest in a way that transcends the normal degree of deception found in 
any given Dip game".  Certainly one could use a false identity in real life
for unscrupulous reasons and cause great harm, however all I've seen Harry
do is create a new persona which he used to play a game, which he had a 
lot of fun role playing, and which in general seems to have been regarded
as a good joke by those he played with.  I really don't see it any different
than what anyone who has ever played a role playing game does.

<p>
Had Harry taken it outside the game to some benefit for himself or detriment
to others I would agree with you whole heartedly.  As to whether or not he
harmed the games he was in, I don't believe he did.  This is what I was
alluding to in what you raise as my third point below.  People who knew
they were playing with Harry, and who had played with him before, would have
been drawing on past experience in any game with him.  Those who had not
played with him before would not have been able to do so.  I certainly
don't see eliminating that past history as a violation, even in principle,
of the rules of Diplomacy.

<p>
My basic point is that I feel, personal opinion here of course, that you
are taking what Harry did out of context.  Certainly falsifying one's 
identity can be used for many bad purposes, but here it was used for fun
in a responsible manner and caused no harm to anyone.   I disagree that
is shows some ``fundamental dishonesty" and I honestly feel that you are
misjudging Harry because of it, to both your and his loss.  Perhaps the
reason your message made enough of an impact on me to spur my reply is
that my own first thought on hearing of the hoax was one of envy that Harry
had pulled it off and not me.  By association therefore, your comments
on Harry's character also reflect on mine, and not too surprisingly, I 
don't think them jusfified in my case.

<p>
Please note that this does not mean I've taken any offense, nor do I in any
way insist that you change your opinion, or even that your opinion is 
wrong, but I invite you in turn to consider that perhaps you are viewing
the action in an absolute ``black or white" manner that is leading you to
making incorrect assumptions about Harry's character and that what we are
really dealing with here is one of the lighter shades of grey.

I have had disagreement with some people on the opposite side of this

And, implicit in that was the game-fun connection.
My opinion, and it is only that (just as David and Steve note), is that
the fun has been maximized for all the way it played out.
The joke had gone on long enough and it was more fun for Don and I
to visit Harry (I think Harry will certainly agree that he enjoyed our

The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
I also finally decided that I need a new tape deck to do this, that my
20 year old dinosaur simply won't do it adequately.
And NAPSTER sorts of issues also have been floating through my mind.
I do have CD write capability, but I've never done any of that sort
of thing before.....
I think I'll end up doing this over the Christmas vacation this year.
Then I'll either find a commercial service or perhaps buy some new
equipment to get the copying done.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.

Dear Eric,

<p>
Lately, I've availed myself of Napster-the Net service which 
offers folks a chance to ``swap" music that they've gained access to by 
some means or another.  It is deathly slow in downloading tunes, and 
you're at the mercy of the person whose tunes you're copying (if they go 
offline while you are downloading, the process stops and you're out of luck).

<p>
Anyway, I've managed to avail myself of the entire new Peter 
Gabriel ``Ovo" by this manner.   You and Cathy should like it, with its 
interludes of Irish folk.  I've also been copying several tunes by a 
newish band named ``Porcupine Tree":  they do progressive rock 
instrumentals of impressive complexity, some of which run for 10-20 
minutes apiece!
<i>((Ah, reminds of the good old Genesis/Renaissance days....))</i>

<p>
I found a site from Compact Disk Services, which sells a lot of 
``progressive", ``spacerock", etc cds.  Their site is useful for getting 
the names of bands; then I go to find them on Napster and download 
samples (or whole albums) of their work.
     
<p>
I've also downloaded a few oldies from the 60's, which I never 
seemed to pick up in my myriad albums.
Songs like ``Judy in Disguise", ``96 Tears", and lots of old Tommy James 
and the Shondells.  I still have a
song running through my head called ``Bittersweet (better stay away from 
her)" which for the life of me I can't think of the band that performed 
it.  Got any guesses?

Emmert asks, ``Am I hopelessly old-fashioned?"
No, he's hopelessly new-fashioned. Or else just too prissy.

<p>
This idea of keeping all dishonesty ``within the game" is certainly not
something I associate with the old days.  Heck, when I joined the hobby
(1980), they were still talking about the ``flying dutchman" ploy as if it
were a legitimate tactic.

<p>
Cheating has traditionally been part of the game, and often the most fun.
At the Dipcons I attended I remember various schemes to sneak views at
other players' orders, employ non-players to act as spies, and so forth. In
postal Dip I remember people forging letters, either sending them to
directly another player pretending to be someone else, or else pretending
it was from another player to you and forwarding it to a third player. Not
everyone did this, of course, but it wasn't considered unusual. People used
to do strange things to verify their true identity in correspondence.

<p>
The stories of the ``old days" were even worse, with talk of breaking into
people's mailboxes to intercept correspondence or orders, or sending out
phony game reports impersonating the GM. Some people disapproved, and most
GMs ended up writing HRs to protect themselves, but the point remains. In
the old days, cheating was part of the game. The idea that cheating is
wrong is rather novel, I think.  No, I take that back: Everyone agrees that
cheating is ``wrong", but it's fun to do it anyway.

<p>
- - -

<p>
I'm sure this must have come up before, but I totally dropped out of
politics shortly after <i>BZ</i> disappeared. I went from all-out junkie to paying
zero attention.  It wasn't any sort of ``disillusion with the process" or
any of that crap they like to talk about in the news. I just got interested
in other stuff instead. Since then I haven't even voted.

<p>
In the past few months, I've started paying a little attention again, but
nothing like before.  I haven't kept up with Nader recently, but your
description sounds like what I used to think of him. I doubt I'd vote for
Nader or the Green Party anyway, on account of specific issues I think
they're wrong on (regulatory policy and local manufacture, respectively).

<p>
I have a friend who supports Nader because she loves him, which I think is
charming. Such a refreshing contrast to the rest of his following, which
seems to be overwhelmingly negative. She also seems to be one of the few
Naderite liberals who has a sense of humor and respects people who don't
share her political views. Maybe there's a connection there.

<p>
A while ago I was forwarded a copy of the email propaganda written by
Michael Moore in ``support" of Ralph Nader. Perhaps you've seen it.  It says
nothing about what Nader wants to do as president (not to mentioned the
likelihood of him accomplishing it in the event he were elected). Just a
whole lot of sass about ``fight against the bastards", ``let 'em all have
it", ``toss yourselves inside the booth like a political molotov cocktail",
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork..... I especially like that one.
And as my wife said when I told her that one, ``and NO ONE will care a whit."))</i>
``Payback Time", ``mad as hell we are and how we are not going to take it
anymore", and ``stick it to the whole bloody system". What's really
disturbing about it is that you could change just a few lines and the whole
thing would be an equally compelling argument to vote for Pat Buchanan.
That's the nature of the ``none of the above" argument.

<p>
Michael Moore is a dick. His whole career is based on the idea that if you
stick a camera in someone's face long enough so that he tells you to go to
hell, that proves he's a villain who has something to hide. All it really
proves is that you're a dick.
<i>((Too bad all of you can't see me as I put this letter in.
I laughed all the way through it when I first saw it, and then
am doing so again as I polish everything up in what amounts for me
to be ``final production'', though obviously I don't put much into
prettification.))</i>

<p>
In his Nader screed, Moore claims to speak for the ``silent majority" who
never vote. What crap. I haven't voted in several years, and he sure
doesn't support me. People like him, along with the mainstream news media,
want us to believe that non-voters have stayed home because they're fed up
with the political system. Not true. The three main reasons why people
don't vote are: (1) they don't care, (2) they're lazy, or (3) they've done
the math and realize how important their vote is.  Apathy is not a form of
political activism; it's just apathy.

<p>
I don't expect to vote this year either, though if I did I assume it would
be for Gore. I haven't really kept up with him, but I doubt I'd vote for a
Republican for president. Notwithstanding the various disagreements, major
and minor, I've had with the Democratic Party, they still come closest to
what I believe in. I honestly know nothing at all about GW Bush.

<p>
The selection of Cheney as VP was significant to me only in that it was a
reminder that when you vote for a president you vote for the party. Even if
it turns out GW himself is likable, he still has to build an
administration, and the appointees are all going to come from among the
Republicans, and with them come all their traditions. That's the Cheney
lesson.

<p>
Of course that cuts both ways. There's plenty of Democrats I don't like.
One of them is Lieberman, who seems to be one of the main ``mentionables"
for Gore's running mate. Bleah. 
<i>((Further reactions now that mention has become fact??
I am reminded mostly that I like Lieberman as a person and I'd be his
friend if I knew him, BUT he is THE most political of all four of the 
P/VP candidates from the two major parties.
Still, since I like him that doesn't bother me as much as it would
if I didn't like him... purely viscerally.))</i>
I don't much like John Kerry either. If he
picked Bob Kerrey, that would be cool. Even better, for me, would be if it
were someone from the school of 80s neoliberals - like Bruce Babbitt, or
Dick Lamm. I'm still a neoliberal at heart. It makes one wonder. Maybe it's
like patriotism: loyalty to the habits of one's youth. I got my start in
politics as a Hart Democrat, after the 1984 campaign.

<p>
I still like Clinton. I understand he's not popular anymore, though I'm
really not sure why. Did I miss something? Is all of this really just
because he got a couple of blow jobs, or is there something else?
<i>((Depends.
I still know a lot of those ``southern people'' (mostly) who have always had
these intense visceral negative reactions to Bill C. and they just stay the same.
I suppose one would say these are Rush Limbaugh types, but I'm talking about
people I know with Ph.D.'s and stuff.
But it doesn't seem to be anything except pure intense dislike.
My wife (gee, mentioning Charlotte in two letters in the same szine!)
says these people are in intense pain from the long sticks that have been
shoved up their butts by someone or another, hard to tell who.))</i>

<p>
In the late 80s and early 90s Clinton was always mildly disappointing
because of his willingness to get along with the ``establishment" wing of
the Party, but he was still neoliberal at his wonkish core. As far as I'm
concerned he's fundamentally right about the economic issues: trade,
spending, taxing. That's what really matters. All that other crap about
cheating on his wife or being weasely I just don't get. What is it that
people think the president does? His job is to run the U.S. government.
Basically that means managing a lot of money and fussing with the
administrative details of a very large organization. The way people talk,
you'd think they were voting for Dad, not president.
<i>((There are elements of this.
I'm convinced that this whole psychological story goes back to 1980.
As most people know (and more and more details have come out very recently),
George Bush repudiated his ``voodoo economics'' primary statements to 
suddenly become Reagan's best alternative when the negotiations with 
Gerald Ford (to be some kind of new ``joint Presidents") just became
totally ridiculous.
Well, since George denied himself, he never really (I'm pretty convinced of
this) ever became ``his own man'' again.
He did manage to defeat someone who destroyed what little identity he had
(Michael Dukakis) in that famous debate, but once he opposed someone with
a vision (in 1992) he was toast.
Never grasped an identity that people could grab on to.
Now, this really is a contest between two men (one the son of the man who couldn't
succeed at establishing an independent identity and the other trying to avoid
the same fate as that same man - obviously with very different baggage though).
I could be a bit too far out there.
Perhaps this psychological identity game won't be the deciding factor.
But I really think it will be.
So far, I put Al Gore just a nose ahead on this, but just that nose.
I will root for the kind of wide open debates that will assist these
psychological gamesmanship ideas but I doubt I'll get them.))</i>

<p>
It's really a shame that the political parties have fallen together in such
a way that the world trade issue never gets properly debated. Among other
things, that's what killed the Reform Party. I was really excited about the
RP back when it looked like the Lamm wing might become dominant, but Perot
made such a splash about the whole NAFTA thing that it brought in a huge
influx of nativists, which paved the way for Buchanan to take over.

<p>
I haven't been watching for about six years, so maybe it's changed, but I
always thought Clinton's wing of the Democratic Party was exactly right on
trade. That is, world trade is good, but with two large caveats: first,
free trade is a genuine principle, to be taken seriously and not just used
as an excuse for large quasi-monopolistic corporations in all countries to
screw their publics, and second, there are certain economic externalities
and it is the job of the government to either internalize or remedy them.
<i>((That's precisely where I am too, as we debated out at length back
in the 1980's, probably boring people to death.
I remember that eventually you started to edit down my long, long missives
on these subjects.))</i>

<p>
The first is nothing special, just that there are always hypocrites and
opportunists ready to make the most of any policy. You try to resist them
as well as you can, given the realities of government. The point is free
trade is a good policy because (and only insofar as) it serves the general
public interest. This is what has been lost due to the lack of debate, with
the Buchananites and the Naderites presuming to speak for populism against
the corporatism of the ``Republicrats".

<p>
That's why the second caveat is so important. In the early 90s, that was
one of the core ideas of neoliberalism. That economic policies serving the
general good entailed winners and losers on the micro level, and the role
of the government was to repair the inequalities to everyone's benefits.
<i>((Or another way to put it, to restructure the rules of the game
to reduce the inequities, I was never comfortable with what I called
old liberal arguments of ``picking winners and losers''.
The government still is the best example of doing that, it's called
the Defense Industry.
You know that the Defense Department has admitted that they will NEVER,
EVER be able to meet Government accounting guidelines for delineating 
the ways that our money is spent, they are that far out of whack.
The VA, where I work, is little better, but I still crusade as much
as I can on the inside to make it work better.
But Government desperately needs to pay lots of money for REAL financial
managers.
There are too many people with little more than secretarial type budgeting
skills running million/billion dollar financial systems.
Sorry, off on a tangent.
But, I like to assume that the private sector does have competent 
financial management.
And you need to set the rules of the game that those people operate
under so they still have the capability of screwing up and losing 
all their money.
It's the American way....))</i>
In the 1992 campaign, Clinton embraced that. Did they keep it up? I really
don't know. If they did, then they need to make that more clear to the
public. That's the reply to the third-party anti-world-trade crowd, and
it's also what distinguishes the Democrats from the Republicans.

<p>
Anyway, that's as close as you'll get to me commenting on Gore as a
presidential candidate.  As I mentioned, I really know next to nothing
about the actual candidates. I'm just rehashing everything I learned about
national politics in the late 80s and early 90s. Maybe it'll be enough to
keep the lingering <i>BZ</i> nostalgics happy. Is Stabosz on you mailing list? I
know Barno is.

<p>
I saw one of the pundit shows early this weekend about the VP speculation.
(Has it been picked yet? I know the announcement is not until tomorrow, but
they thought it would be floated sooner.) Judging from their comments, it
sounds like the logic for picking Lieberman is that he's such a goody-goody
that it would send a message that the Party does not approve of
presidential blowjobs ... which is pretty much what I don't like about him.
They call him a ``moderate" Democrat, but as far as I can tell the essence
of his moderation is that whenever the moralistic wing of the GOP wants to
ban something, Nanny Joe is the first Democrat to jump on board.

ally in the back, but he never led anyone to believe that he wouldn't
have to eventually.  He didn't take any of it personally, as any good
Diplomacy player should.  The ones who lost and are bitter, just never
``got it".

<p>
I won't bore you with my opinions on details of the show/game/event, but
I think this guy deserves a Golden Knife Award for playing the game of
Diplomacy the way it was meant to be played.

At first I wanted anyone but Rich to win, but in the end I found myself
cheering for him.  He had a strategy, he played it well, he was fairly
open about it.  You have to admire him for that much.

He is like your diplomacy adversary that lied to you, played you like a

I was happy for Rich also.  I was extremely sick and tired of hearing
Kelly whine about how she felt bad about the alliance.  Rich's
attitude where he basically said, ``I have a strategy, I executed the
strategy, and I have no regrets". was much more appealing to me.

I agree with this sentiment 100%.  Rich stayed on point when pressed in
the trial.  He didn't waver and he didn't pander for votes.  And
contrary to what Roger implies in his Dip analogy, I don't think he
actually lied much, if at all, to anyone.  He's more like the Dip player
who you KNOW is screwing you behind you back, but always keeps to the
letter of his agreements.  Anyone else think he tanked the last immunity
challenge on purpose knowing that Kelly would win and pick him?  If Rich
won himself, he'd be forced to kick Rudy off and I really don't think he
wanted to do that directly.  Good play.

And Kelly was so deathly afraid of offending someone who was there

I agree that Rich was pandering, but he was also emphasizing how
he played the game.  ``I choose Rudy because he was honest and
stuck with me, and Greg because I suspected he was the most like
me, so I wanted him gone!"  Trying to turn an event that could
provoke animosity into a compliment.

<p>
I think that Kelly was trying too hard in answering the questions.
Rich had a much more positive attitude.  It said, ``I don't know
what you want, or what will sway you.  Since I don't know, I may
as well just stick with the truth.  This is who I am, how I

As the big Kelly promoter on the group, yes, even I was appalled at
how far she went with this.  I think Rich really did wear her down
with his psychology.  The mental strain (well known to all of us
who have played Dip FTF - how many of you playing by E-Mail have
``taken a break to get your head together" - can't do it FTF in
real time....) got to her at that point.  All things considered
(as in not responding to Susan's tirade) she did well.  But she
did get a tad annoying.  

<p>
In predicting Kelly would win way back in Week 3 or whatever, I
thought that she would stay a bit looser and be voted the winner
on that basis.  Plus I thought that more people would see through Rich
(especially with Jeff's prompting).  But that simply was not the case.
Survivor II will be VERY different on that score.  Rich won the novice
game.  Next game will be played with at least some Intermediate players.

Random points...

<p>
1) Anyone feel like they've heard variations of Rich's opening and closing
remarks when playing Diplomacy?  Particularly in an endgame when there are
tough decisions to be made?

<p>
2) I should have mugged Sean when I had the chance.  True story: on Sunday
morning, I was in front of a hotel in midtown Manhattan, and the
Alphabetizer himself is standing 15 feet from me.  Blue cap on backwards,
wearing a Massapequa t-shirt (Long Island town).  The first thing I hear him
say is to some woman having trouble with her eye.  He says, ``Want me to take
a look at it?  I'm a doctor."  The second thing I hear is him blabbing to a
group of bystanders, ``I was on that TV show, Survivor."  At that point, I
got too disgusted to stand there, so I jetted.  Wish I had seen the final
vote before that encounter, because I would have whomped his ass and blamed
it on a crusade against the letter S.
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork....))</i>

<p>
3) Personally, I thought Greg's ``number" vote to be the epitome of
cowardice.  If I had such power to change people's lives, I would think long
and hard about it, and make a decision I could live with afterward.  Having
the entire nation know that the lives of two people were so heavily based on
``pick a number between 1 and 10," well, I would find that embarassing.
Think a girl with a brain would want to end up with a responsibility-dodger
like him?

<p>
4) I was rooting for Kelly, and so I thought Sue's tirade was great.  I knew
it would change at least one vote in Kelly's favor.  The term Chainsaw
Diplomacy comes to mind, though with a kind of unintended focus and result.

<p>
5) The show was very interesting to watch.  I have to admit I was hooked,
and so were a lot of other people in this newsgroup.  After all the crap
spewed about Richard in the national press, he comes out on top.
Machiavelli is the winner.  Who says there's no hope for us Dippers?

As a fellow Brown grad, I'll jump in to defend Greg here. I don't
believe for a second that Greg actually used the pick a number thing to
choose his vote. He's the one castaway that has shared NOTHING about
himself - he shared little emotions while on the island and since then
has avoided the media circus that the others seem to love. Who knows
why he voted for Rich - but my guess is he doesn't want to share his
thinking and used the number thing as a smokescreen.

<p>
As for the second part of your comment - remember that while Greg might
not have gotten the money, he did get ``some" while on the island. Ever
pull that off in a Dip game?

<i>((On Grant's Point two about Sean:))</i>
He was a moron until the end.  Voting against *Kelly* because she
was scheming and duplicitous?  Was he on the same island as the rest
of them?  Rich was clearly the schemer and the conniving force in 
the group - did he really keep it that much of a secret from Sean?
The rest of the group seems to catch on (even though they never got
to see the video that was shown only to the U.S. audience), so I 
can only assume that Sean is just as blockheaded as he seems.
 
<p>
<i>((Yeah, this is important since Rich said to Bryant Gumbel this morning
(nearly direct quote) ``I never said anything mean".  Most of what 
America hated about Rich was said between Rich and the camera.))</i>

<p>
<i>((On Grant's Point three about Greg's contest:))</i>
I think it was an admission by him that he really didn't like either
one and didn't want to vote for either one.  That seems like a good
way to get back at both of them - Kelly suffers the loss and Rich feels
like he didn't really *earn* the win.  Unless, of course, Greg wanted
to vote for Rich and just wanted it to seem random.

<p>
<i>((I think that might have been it.  They don't really say anything about
how much interaction between the Jury was allowed outside the box.  
Perhaps they all were isolated, but perhaps not.  Greg may have known
or strongly suspected he was the deciding vote.
My understanding was that they WERE talking outside the Tribal Council box.))</i>

<p>
<i>((On Grant's Point four on Sue's tirade:))</i>
Right - the longer she talked, the more I thought Kelly would win.
I figured Sue and Rudy would vote for Rich and Colleen and Jenna and
Gervase would vote for Kelly, no matter what.  When I saw Greg ask
them for numbers, I thought ``oh, gosh, he's picking at random."  When
I saw Sean's vote, I thought ``holy cow, Rich has a chance."  So I was
only slightly less stunned than the rest of the country when Rich's
name turned up on the last ballot.

<p>
<i>((Well, after thinking about it after Greg's question, I pretty much 
knew Rich had won it, I'd already deflated my Kelly rooting before
Jeff opened it.))</i>

I was a Kelly convert (like Jody), but was being realistic..I mean, she had
to win two more immunity challenges, it was going to take a miracle
to pull it off...
and then she did it.

<p>
<i>((Yeah, well, at least on this list, I led the Kelly charge and you can 
imagine the whooping in my house..... and Richard's calculating was so
``him".  Just before he did that, I told my wife Rich is going to quit
on purpose.  And then he did.  And I knew Kelly could outlast Rudy,
so really it was no contest.))</i>

<p>
<i>((I thought that winning the ``know the other players" would have had more
of an effect on the Jury and showed just how shallow Richard was.
``No, I have no friends in this group, it takes years to develop
friends [well, actually it does, of course] and I didn't really and
still don't really care about these people."))</i>

<p>
I was SO sure she was going to win.....I figured Colleen, Gervase, and Jenna
would vote for Kelly (although it seemed like Colleen had a hard time
making up her mind), and Rudy and Susan for Rich.....and at least one of
Sean and Greg HAD to vote for Kelly over Rich, right?
Dammit.

<p>
<i>((Double Damnit!!!))</i>

<p>
I think Sean proved in his little EOG vote message (a) how much of an idiot
he was, and (b) how well Rich played him...you have to give Rich *some*
credit.  Sean thought Kelly was two-faced and manipulative...two-faced,
possibly, but Rich was by far the most manipulative castaway, and Sean never
saw it.
And Greg, after seeing the utter disdain for the alphabet strategy...I can't
believe he did that.  Where were Sue's testicular comments this time? ;-)

<p>
<i>((Both Sean and Greg really, because REMEMBER that Greg tried to join
Richard's alliance and Rich humored him, but then voted him right off.
Sean played Rich like a flute (instrument choice chosen carefully ;-)
throughout, even with the alphabet strategy.  But Greg, I really thought
he could see how Rich was playing him.
And Sue's tirade was not unexpected.... clearly she'd had enough of
Kelly by that point.
In some ways, Richard's greatest coup was manipulating Kelly to kick Sue
off instead of him.))</i>

<p>
Her tirade was the reason I thought one of Sean or Greg would swing... I
figured Sean would give her sympathy.....I didn't know about Greg.

<p>
<i>((Yeah, Greg was a bit enigmatic.  He's a really smart guy who is the
``yeah, I'm smart but I don't like anyone to know and don't really want
to do anything with my smarts".  He showed it in spades here.  In
retrospect, I'm wondering how much Rich knew this.  Probably not
at all, he was still locked up in his own head.  I think of Greg
as the classic Aspen ski bum type of Coloradoan.))</i>

<p>
Ah well.........after practically everyone said Richard didn't stand a
chance, he pulled it off.  There were 3 Tagi and 4 Pagong on the Jury, and
if Pagong had all pulled together, Kelly would have won.
By the way, when you're trying to ``choose a number", why the hell would you
pick 9?  Especially if you let Rich go first, and Greg ``knows" that everyone
picks 7........sounds like Greg may have *wanted* Rich to win, but couldn't
say why.  Maybe even subconsciously............who knows.

I didn't like Kelly because of the incessant hand-wringing about being
in the ``dirty" alliance and all that. YUCK!! Rich may be a smug arrogant
jerkface, but at least he knew what he wanted. It's better this way...
Kelly didn't get the million, but at least she wasn't ``tainted" by it
either.

<p>
I also got annoyed by Kelly's argument to ``vote for the better person".
Puh-leaze!! But I *loved* Rich's rejoinder... that they should ``vote for
whoever played the game best". Nicely done.

<p>
I do think that *to the jury* Kelly came off as being very duplicitous.
I think it's pretty presumptious for those of us that only watched the
show on TV to sit in judgement of people who were ``fooled" by Rich. I
don't think they were fooled by him at that point! I think that they
realized that in many ways Rich's game was more ``honest" than Kelly's
game. Yes, even stupidass Sean realized this! So let's cut the jury some
slack here.

<p>
Anyway, props to Kelly... 5 challenges in a row. Wow!

<p>
Props to Rudy... final 3 plus in the last challenge he stayed standing
for 4 hours, 11 minutes! Not bad for a 72-year old geezer. And hey, if
he HAD managed to win that challenge, he would've won the million. He
also came close on the previous challenge, which I bet few people here
guessed would happen.

<p>
Boo to Susan. Ugly display. Ugly ugly ugly.

<p>
Congrats to Rich. There were any number of times when he COULD have been
voted off, but in the end those who should have known better never got
it done. The one challenge he won might've been critical too.

<p>
I do think there will be more strategizing next time. It won't be so
easy for one alliance to sail through like that. People won't be in such
denial about what is happening, and people will realize that you CAN
fight an alliance by forming a larger one or by working to break it up.
The alliance in this game seemed to be pretty weak, really. I think a
more concerted effort to break it up would have worked. But it didn't
happen; not fast enough anyway.

Ah well, enough rambling. It was a good show. And I LOVE that Rich beat

I was a strong Rudy supporter, so I can understand why Kelly chose Rich -
she was playing the percentages.  She had to know that Rudy would win Sue's
vote and probably Richard's and would be at least as popular with the
Pagong members of the jury.  She had to figure that Sue and Rudy would vote
for Rich, but not many others.  I would argue that Sean's vote for Richard
was a understanding of how the game was played and how it should be played.
Richard may have been manipulative but he didn't say he'd do one thing and
then do another on a consistent basis.  Kelly did, all the time whining
about the morality of the Alliance.

<p>
Yeah, you knew something was going to be coming from Sue, it had been
building up.  The interesting thing is, or seems to be, that if she hadn't
made that tirade Richard would have won without Greg's selection ``system".

<p>
<i>((On Trevor's theory:))</i>
Exactly.  I do think that Greg knew what he was doing. It was as close to a
``force" as you're ever going to see.  He asked Richard first.  Assume that
every person who goes first will pick ``7".  The second person should not
pick a number higher than ``7", because ``7" will then win with any lower
number.  Kelly should probably have taken ``4" which would have given her
control of the first  5 numbers and Rich the second 5, or ``6" which would
have given her control of all the lower numbers. Given that Greg knew that
smart game play dictates that the second player will pick a number lower
than ``7", by making his number ``9" he was giving Rich the prize - IF Rich
was smart enough to see it for what it was.
 
<p>
Oh well, my man Rudy came off with $75,000.  Could have been more if he
hadn't mis-ordered: hand to pole instead of hand to other side of idol.

<i>((On Grant's Point three about Greg's test:))</i>
Only if you believe it.  He didn't say, ``I will pick whoever comes
closest, (or furthest)."  It could have been a character test.  If
either of the players thought too much about the answer, he would vote
against them. If it <i>was</i> a guess closest number, then Kelly missed
a trick by not guessing `6'.  She would be closer 60% of the time,
instead of only 50% of the time.
He may have already picked Rich, but wanted deniability.  I don't
think that the question or the tactic shows great character, but
the network no doubt loved the suspense.

<p>
<i>((On Grant's Point four about Sue's tirade:))</i> 
Actually, it looks like she overdid it.  Certainly Gervase reacted
negatively to it, and Colleen said that she had changed her vote,
to Kelly, as a result of the questions and answers.

<p>
By the way, I loved that debate format.  Maybe we can do the same
with presidential debates, but instead of voting them off the
island, we get to vote to make them <i>stay</i> on a deserted island?

<p>
I thought that Kelly's opening statements were very defensive, almost
apologetic.
I think that the line about not giving Kelly a drink of water if she
were dying of thirst was <i>definitely</i> overkill, and a statement at
odds with Sue's morality.  However, the coverage of what exact lie
Sue was so upset about was not made very clear to the audience in
the show's selection of conversations.

<p>
It was interesting, Richard was the least perceptive about the minutiae
of his fellow castaways, because he concentrated exclusively on his
fellow castaways as game players only.  On the other hand, Kelly
outraged Sue when she befriended Pagong members, and didn't win
much trust because they saw it as an act!

<p>
I don't think future Survivor players will be learning the right lessons
if they emulate Rich in that regard.  I think Rich's greatest weakness
was that he was so focussed on the game that he saw other people as
pawns, and projected that impression as well.  If <i>Rich</i> asked for
personal information, it was because he wanted to get a psychological
feel for how they played, not because he was interested in them as
persons.

<p>
Kelly was probably the best of everybody in drawing people into
conversations, but she didn't feel comfortable applying that information
into a strategy!

<p>
I suspect that there will be a number of `lessons' learned from
Survivor which will be proven completely wrong.  Like newbies who
have just discovered the Juggernaut Alliance, they start focussing
all their strategies towards being or beating the Juggernaut.

<p>
First bad lesson:
Everybody has to be part of an Alliance.
Not true, multilateral play still has its purpose.

<p>
Second bad lesson:
Being nice and non-threatening will get you voted out.
Not precisely true.  If Sean had been a little (a lot) more clever
or if Kelly broke more effectively with the Alliance around
6 or 7 members, Sean would have been in great endgame
position.  He would have had to win an immunity somewhere
because he would have been seen as an endgame threat.

Third bad lesson:
The leader or initiator of the alliance will do well.
Not true.  If an alliance gets into difficulties it
will likely devour its own head in order to present
itself as a new entity in order to change its
reputation and relations with others.

<p>
<i>((Reacting to point one of Grant Flowers on Diplomacy endgame statements))</i> 
You bet, Grant. Reminded me of a guy I played once who was named for a
president and a plant . . .

<p>
<i>((On point three of Grant's on Greg:))</i>
That was my first reaction, too, but I amended it after the post-game show,
when Greg said ``everybody picks seven" and everybody else said that Greg was
``extremely intelligent". My read of Greg is that he's the kind of asshole
who loves thinking that he's just so much wittier than the rest of us that
the rest of us will never figure him out. Bottom line: it was his way of
``cleverly" voting for Rich and leaving the rest of the world mystified in
his wake. In his own way, his arrogance exceeds Rich's by miles.

<p>
<i>((On point four of Grant's and Chainsaw Diplomacy:))</i>
Grant, I'm beginning to think that you are incapable of posting to RGD
without tweaking my nose :-) Yes, this is the reason to use Chainsaw tactics
sparingly, knowingly, and with understanding of risk. Susan wasn't
Chainsawing so much as purely venting her spleen. She cemented her place as
the ugliest personality on the island with that effort. Gervase's rejoinder
was perfect. I live in the same state as Susan, so the local news was really
playing up the local angle-they had her family lined up for live post-show
interviews. I didn't watch them, but I can just imagine how uncomfortable
the local news directors were as they watched Susan make a singularly
unlikeable ass of herself. ``Stay tuned after the show to see the family of
the unlikeable bitch squirm in embarrassment!"

<p>
And I was rooting *against* Kelly. Her endgame angst sorely taxed me. The
``Gee, I want to win the money, but I feel so guilty about it" bit was
repulsive to me. All the more so, because it was apparently genuine. I'd
have proudly cast a vote for Rich and said ``I'm doing this because he's the
only one left standing who knows who he is and what he wants". Kelly would
be in denial for the rest of her life about how and why whe got the million
and that's not ``ethical" IMO.

Just to get the ball rolling:

<p>
Susan:  Gervase hit the nail on the head when he pegged her as a sore
loser.  My God, what a whiny bitch.  Everything she accused Kelly of she'd
done herself more often and without compunction.

<p>
<i>((Boy, precisely.  Although Susan tried to backtrack in some of the post
game discussion with Bryant Gumbel last night and this morning, it was
clear that she was mega-annoyed.  The psychiatrist for the show reported
that her first words after coming across the bridge after being voted
off was, ``get me a cigarette!".))</i>

<p>
Rudy:  I was kinda rooting for him at the end.  If Kelly had voted with
her heart rather than her head, she might have let him stay in the game,
but she didn't.  I'm surprised the r.g.d community hasn't written off
Rudy's strategy as ``carebear" play. :-)

<p>
<i>((It was.  Rudy would be a good little carebear.  Of course, Rich was
playing the ``Carebear, Dan Shoham variation" with Rudy. (reminder, the
Carebear, Dan Shoham variation requires the stab for the win on the
last turn)  Rich chose not to have immunity for the last vote precisely
because he had calculated that Rudy would pick him for the final two
by virtue of his promise and Kelly would pick him by virtue of his,
well, his perceived lower voting power.  By the way, she was right.
Rudy would have beaten her by better than the 4-3 vote.))</i>

<p>
Kelly:  She voted with her head, which I wasn't sure she was going to do.
Obviously she thought she stood a better chance against Rich than against
Rudy.  If nothing else, she deserves mondo props for winning five
consecutive challenges.

<p>
<i>((And to think it all came down to a DICE ROLL (Greg's ``pick a number
between 1-10'' strategy).  Kelly was surprised and didn't pick the correct
response from a probability standpoint (6) to Rich's ``Three" type choice
of lucky 7.  Greg, of course, had 9 and that decided the whole thing.
Now, to all Diplomacy players deciding things on a dice roll seems
REALLY wacko.  Obviously, I'm upset since I wanted my choice Kelly
to do it.))</i>

<p>
Rich:  As in so much of everyday life, a Three wins out and learns nothing
from the experience, because he doesn't have to face failure.  One point
to Susan for pegging his inability to admit to being imperfect without a
long-winded self-justification.  I really hope the next ``Survivor" series
features a few non-Threes who know how to think strategically.

World DipCon winner) would be one person who would have kept Rich's
pants and beaten him into the ground.  But there was no one like that

I've got to believe that Rich's jerkiness was *calculated strategy.*
Every outward sign of his smugness and clothlessness from day one was
all set up for that moment when Kelly voted off Rudy (note - I haven't
heard any post finale comments from Rich on this - it's all
speculation.)

<p>
He did mention that even before he got on the island he was plotting
how to survive 14 banishments. (He's the guy trying to figure out his
18th dot back in F'01, while you just want to know who your next ally
is.) The first few are easy - just don't be the weakest. Meanwhile,
watch the others and figure out how to form an alliance. The alliance
gets you down to the final 3-4, but then what? How do you survive those
final votes? Rich found the obvious solution - by being the biggest
jerk - the one everyone else wants to be paired with for the jury vote.

<p>
My gut feeling - Rich was playing to put himself in the best possible
position to come in second. The best thing about being second (in
addition to the $100K) is that you always have a chance (if, say, the
jury contains two flakes, a military guy with a sense of honor, and a
vindictive b*tch) to win the whole thing.

<p>
Bravo Rich - well played.

Among a group of people with conflicting goals, the strongest will be most
successful in achieving those goals. If the weaker members of the group
don't want to always be losing to the stronger ones, they create laws,
enforced by alliance, that govern how the strong can use their strength.
We call this civilization.

<p>
The strong person who dedicates himself to law (Superman, Batman, Zorro, the
Lone Ranger) is a myth. And alliances are formed everywhere, from inner-city
gangs, to political parties, to the players in a million-dollar TV game
show. But because alliances don't fit the superhero myth well, they are
often scorned.

<p>
After all, if the impetus for alliances is relative weakness, then joining
an alliance is a sign of weakness, an acknowledgement that one is not a
superhero who stands alone.

I wonder if other cultures reacted as negatively to the Survivor alliance as
did the US audience.

A suggestion for the third season:
Our castaways are marooned in New York City.  The eight members of each
tribe start out sharing John Quarto's groovy apartment in Brooklyn.  At the
end of the first week, it goes co-op and they have to move to a ``roomy"
studio in the East Village.  Each week they move all of their crap by subway
(they can bring as much stuff as they want, provided they move it all each
week) to increasingly skeezy digs somewhere across town.  By the final week,
they're in a burned out squat on a crack corner in the South Bronx.

<p>
<i>((If it's anything like John's former groovy apartment in downtown
Boston: AMEN, BROTHER!  For each move they have to beg, borrow or
steal enough pin money to make the payments on each move (this can
also determine how quickly they end up the squat).))</i>

<p>
Immunity challenges include parking in midtown, convincing a cabbie to go to
Harlem and eating dirty-water hotdogs.  The winner would receive $1 million
on the books or the equivalent after taxes (about $34.95).

They didn't put mud on their feet.  And that's a good thing, because it's
the sweat off the soles of your feet that keeps the coals from burning

That is false.  Coal walking is possible with completely dry feet.
Although the coals are very hot, they also have a low heat conductance.
You can be in contact with them for a few seconds before you get burned.
I am sure you have walked across a concrete patio that has gotten hot
from being in the sun.  You never see anyone walking across a red hot
copper frying pan.  The most dangerous thing about coal walking is that
you might get a coal stuck between your toes.

Evidently, the last immunity challenge has always been some sort of
endurance test (including the earlier versions of this show in other
countries). So I expected something like that. And really, Rudy did
VERY well. FOUR hours and 11 minutes, and he probably could have
gone longer but lost concentration. Now, I realize, Kelly was very
focused and probably could have stood there 6 hours or more. But, at
least, Rudy gave her the opportunity to slip up.

You know, if Sue had won the previous challenge and not been voted
off, Rudy might have won that last challenge!! Rudy did really
really well. He didn't win, but he certainly could have.

Agreed there. The older ones tended to be wiser about playing the

somebody at least to set it up and train me so I could work with it.
But I'd be glad to do your entry page explaining the event, with links
to the video feeds and to rules and player bio's and hobby sites, and
whatever else you'd want.  And I'd promote it on www.DiplomaticCorps.org
which is the only site I've posted on the Internet.

<p>
The closest thing I've heard of was years ago, before the Internet was
in homes.  A prize tournament in Las Vegas was announced (and turned out
to be a hoax from the Jack Masters zine-faking machine) in the early
eighties.  The players would communicate through a set of computer
terminals in different rooms, making negotiation dependent on one's
words and not one's face.  The final board would have all negotiations
shown on a big screen for the rest of the people to watch.  The winner
was to receive a five-figure cash award.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>TWO NEW GAME OPENINGS (guest written by brilliant counselor at law Steve Emmert):

<p>
In many of the games run in this szine and elsewhere, there is a fundamental
element of unfairness that taints the entire process.  Diplomacy is a game
of honor and treachery; of loyalty and betrayal; of truth and lies.  But it
is fundamentally a competition among people seeking to manipulate one
another, and therein lies the problem.  The problem is lawyers, who
occasionally play in games without disclosing their profession.  You see, I
(and many other like-minded GM's) feel it is fundamentally unfair to require
amateur liars to compete against professionals.

<p>
But we can't merely shut the whole legal profession out of the hobby.  There
are, after all, several excellent Diplomacy players among the members of the
bar, and they have a right of free association, too.  I have decided that
the best way to reconcile these two opposing concerns is to offer each camp
its own separate theater of operation.  Accordingly, I hereby announce two
gamestarts, each of which shall be Regular Diplomacy.  One, open only to
attorneys, will be titled, ``The Professional Division."  The other, open
only to nonlawyers, will be called, ``The Amateur Division."  
These games, which I propose to begin simultaneously,
should provide an interesting case study on this particular form of
``professionalism."

<p>
If you have any problems with the structure of the foregoing, you can speak
with my attorney.

<p>
Best wishes.  Steve
Lord of the Three Capitals

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
I plan to invite Mark Franceschini, Paul Windsor, and perhaps Carl Adamec (see above)

<p>
REGULAR GAME: Rick Davis, Jim Burgess (if Russ Rusnak decides to GM it for me)
are tentatively on the list here.
I'm sure this one will fill very quickly.
We'll run both games with standard fees and rules.
The $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance) gives you 
a subscription for the life of the game, which usually is a bargain
at twice the price.
Write to ME about both openings.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The other Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has stepped out of the sixth spot,
so we now need THREE more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).
Not much action here, but I'll keep the opening for now.

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've forgotten just this instant
who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk

<p>
(CHERKASY, A SMALL VILLAGE SOUTHWEST OF KIEV):  Spitoon and Upchuck Press:  In
a surprise move, made from a rather quick decision on the part of a slow
thinking Tzar, Russian man of wars yet fought slid in Norway to eyeball a
more northern passage.  The country of France almost tipped into the English
Channel as all free Frenchmen and some not so free Frenchwomen ran to the
coastline to watch the swells caused by Russian warships, shall we say, on
maneuver?

<p>
(LONDON SEPT 1, 1903): The First 
Sea Lord of the Admiralty, Samuel Owen Barfer (SOB) announced to the 
assembled reporters ``Gentlemen, His Majesty King Edward VII today 
extends an invitation to his cousins, Czar Nicholas II and Kaiser 
Wilhelm II to participate in a grand naval review in honour of their
grandmother, the late Queen Victoria, may God rest her soul." This 
announcement caused muttering amongst the reporters who clamored for 
more information. Barfer motioned to Second Sea Lord Fisher to answer 
any questions. A reporter inquired, ``My Lords, what exactly is the 
purpose of this exercise?" Lord Fisher responded, ``Why to go fishing, of 
course."  

<p>
(ANKARA to BUDAPEST): Silence may be golden but it is
fatal to successful alliances.

<p>
(ENGLISH CHANNEL OCT 1, 1903): Admiral Hood, aboard HMS 
Indescribable, spoke to his officers, ``With the support of HMS 
Indutable(ly) we will force the French fleet to retreat out of the 
Atlantic Ocean and so face our foe, the hated Turk!"  

<p>
(ATHENS NOV 1, 1903): Radical Anarchists from the Free Greece League have 
claimed responsibility for the assassination attempts, during the previous 
night's All Saints Eve religious services, on both the Austro-Hungarian  
and the Turkish ambassadors. Meanwhile, refugees from the north are 
scrambling to find passage on steamships bound for British dependencies 
where peace still prevails.  

<p>
(CONSTANTINOPLE): Amid a crowd of svelte belly dancers,
the Sultan (after taking a not insignificant hit off
of the royal hookah) directed his gaze at the English
ambassador summoned before him. The pale and rotund
Englishman stood in front of the Ottoman leader
defiantly. ``So your government intends to threaten my
people, Briton? Thinly veiled threats emanating from
London have reached the highest corridors of power
here in the capital of Turkey, Englishman." The
British diplomat slowly lost the superior grin on his
face as he realized the gravity of his situation. The
Sultan El Ahbid Ellis was getting worked up now. 
``Tell your king or queen or whoever in Allah's name is
in control up there to mind their own business. Our
quarrel with the Russians is with the Russians and
only the Russians." ``Or so you hope, your highness",
replied the Briton. The Sultan, pushing away the
caressing hands of one of the dancers, started to say
something, thought better of it, and dismissed the
Englishman. 

<p>
As the diplomat retreated to his embassy, El Ahbid
Ellis looked to the Northwest. The kingdom of Bulgaria
lies across the straits and beyond that to the West
were Austrian and Hungarian troops in Serbia; rumored
to be heading South to Athens. A cock crowed in the
distance as thunder rolled ominously in from an
encroaching storm. ``Perhaps all is not as is seems"
reasoned the Turkish leader.  ``Perhaps the Russians
will destroy us..." Mired in momentary depression, the
hedonistic head of state quickly snapped out of it and
resumed his attention to the belly dancers and the now
full hookah before him. ``Well", he reasoned as he blew
out a cloud of blue smoke, &#239;f this really is the end,
one might as well enjoy their last earthly moments as
best they can." Ellis, followed by his sycophantic
concubines, boarded the royal yacht and headed North
into the Black Sea. A crowd on shore watched as the
wooden ship disappeared into the distance. 

<p>
(VIENNA NOV 9, 1903): Newspapers report 
the English Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Sir Cecil M. Underhill, has 
been murdered by unknown assailants. This dastardly deed was reported to 
have occured while Sir Cecil was returning home from the State Opera 
House.  

<p>
(MOSCOW, AUGUST 1903): The Tzar paced the four cubic feet of his closet, 
yelling, screeming, and even screaching. He muttered, ``Now, let's get 
this straight! The Sultan wishes us to vacate Ukraine! The Friar wishes 
us to vacate Galicia! Now, then, that should not be all that bad, huh! 
All we have to do is retreat into Moscow or Warsaw. Not so bad!" The 
floor gave way from under him when he finally wore through the boards of 
that rotted closet. And, would you believe it, the maid's potty was right 
below. Plop! Into the Pool once again, as it were! As he fell, the Tzar 
screamed once again, saying, ``Oh, what a fool I was to believe in rotted 
floors! And, what a fool I would be if I did what the Sultan and Friar 
Tuck wanted me to do!" The Tzar's face turned red, only momentarily, and 
then, once again, turned brown.

<p>
(LEMBURG NOV 11, 1903): The Peoples' Democratic Revolutionary 
Party has made an appeal to all fraternal, peace loving nations of 
Europe to combine and overthrow the cynical, ignorant and morally 
bankrupt Hapsburg regime which enslaves all its nationalities within an 
artificial, autocratic empire.  

<p>
(LONDON NOV 15, 1903): The 
Conservative government of Prime Minister John Beale announced in 
Parliament, ``As of this day England has suspended diplomatic relations 
with the Empire of Austria-Hungary. England is horrified and condemns 
the murder of our Ambassador which the Hapsburg authorities have not 
satisfactorily explained. England further condemns the refusal of the 
Austro-Hungarian government to receive the late Ambassador for the 
official discussion of state relations."  The leader of the opposition 
rose to question the wisdom of the government's actions. In reply the 
Prime Minister said, ``Desperate times require desperate measures."  

<p>
(POPATOVIASKY: A RATHER SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KIEV, UKRAINE, FORMERLY WHITE 
RUSSIA [Circa 1800]): And, there it was - a continuation of the same ole 
saga - down the tubes with the Kaiser. The Tzar had noted a small ulcer 
inside the duodenum [yeah, guys, the is the large tube just beneath and 
in line with the stomach!] of his captor. Using his rubbery fingers 
[those digits he uses to pull back his rubber checks], he stretched 
backwards up through the small intestines and into the duodenum. 
Searching and searching with those sharpened fingers nails, he finally 
pricked the sore. Puss oozed out, and pain shot straight down the tubes 
that held our Tzar captive. Stomach muscles within the Kaiser tightened 
so much that pressure built up inside the large intestines. What a mess. 
The Tzar, once again in the brown instead of the red, shot out of that 
final orifice of which the Kaiser is so much of, and splattered all over 
the insides of that darned spittoon. The Tzar slithered down, down, 
down, to the bottom of the abyss, returning from the slime to the slime. 
He plotted his escape with vigor. Using his rubbery fingers with those 
sharpened nails, he grabbed the ass [now you know where the term ``grab 
ass" originated!] of the Kaiser with the nails of his left hand, and 
pricked the ass of the Kaiser with the nail of the middle finger [and, 
now you know where ``giving one the finger" originated!]. The Kaiser shot 
up out of that spittoon so fast, his pointed head hit and stuck into the 
rafters of the ceiling, finally pulling the Tzar out of the Kaiser's 
slime once and for all. He was free at last. ``What's this, the Kaiser 
pulled loose from the rafters as the Tzar looked downwards"? There it 
was, looming up at him at the rate of 180 pounds per second per second, 
with the Kaiser falling at the same rate. Plop! Right back into the 
spittoon with the Kaiser's ass sealing the fate of the Tzar once again. 
Will this ever end?

<p>
(ANONYMOUS): Nyah, nyah Fr(ied) [as in your mind] Dan! Sticks and stones 
may break my bones but names will never hurt me.

<p>
1) Note John Power's new E-Mail address.

<p>
2) We're trying our new map this turn.
Comments?
Thanks to Dave Partridge for helping me out here.
Remember that written moves above ALWAYS dominate map positions.
I've already discovered that the lower right corner of the board
is a little confusing, that scratched out line means that you can
move between the Antarctic and Tahiti.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(LOUISIANA - VIRGINIA): No hostilities intended.  You should be staying
in place to gain the center.  Just haven't heard from you in a while
and wanted to cover against a slide into Florida.

<p>
(SPAIN - OTTO): Thanks for the kind words, but it's far from over.  Always
a pleasure and a challenge to cross swords with you though!

<p>
(RUSSIA-OTTOMAN): You had your day, and now you will PAY.  How many 
fronts did you think that you could manage, anyway?

<p>
(PORTUGAL to AUSTRIA): Sorry, but I had to change sides in order to
remain a factor in this game. 

<p>
(PAUL to SEAN): You just noticed NOW that you were booted out of your 
home dots?  Did you expect O/C to cover for you?

<p>
(RUSSIA to CHINA): Okay, and now what?

<p>
(SPAIN - NETHERLANDS): Happy hunting.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Lots of great press for the summer season as we near the end of 
the game.
As soon as this one is over, we will start another seven round
NYEED game, so get your reservations for a spot in now, I'm
sure they'll go fast.
I need to think of a good ``nuclear'' name for the game, so
feel free to suggest one.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SARA to MARIE):  Ya da winna baby.  Congrats.  I vote for you for 
Dipster of the year. 
 
<p>
(BOOB to GAME NAMERS): Hmmm, how about Marie Curie for the name of
the next game??  
 
<p>
(POTHEAD to MARIE): When I went to visit Mikey in Yellowstone and 
found an all female apartment, I suspected someting.  All that talk all 
these years about NASCAR, headers, overhead cams, etc. - nothing more 
than to provide a cover ala Sara's cats.  That she had crashed her old 
car and had to move to Winnemucca I accepted.  Little did I know what and 
where Winnemucka was.  Apt name, though.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): Something has come up concerning the recent ``Sara 
Reichert" hoax that has me puzzled.  Does anybody know anything about a book 
(or pamphlet or tract) that might or might not be titled THE DUNGEON MASTER, 
that might or might not have been published in the 70s or 80s, with something 
by somebody named ``Henry Seduschak," who may or may not have lived in Oregon, 
which is not by me but which I am being blamed for?  I would like to know if 
somebody could please send me a summary of what this publication is supposed 
to be about and what I was alleged to have said. Thank you for your time and 
effort. 
<i>((Perhaps someone like Michael Hopcroft can help you out..... one of
my subbers from Oregon who is connected into that community.
It would be a shame to be slammed by John Boardman over something you

(RACOUNTER-SADDAM):  Zzzzzz . . .
   
<p>
(SADDAM-RACOUNTER):  Heh, heh.  You always fall for that trick of my 
falling asleep and stop telling and fall asleep.  Now I am sneaking out 
of the tent.  First to kill a few goats and act like a berserk camel, 
then to slip into Ozana's tent and then into Ozana.  Allah be proud!

<p>
(SARA REICHERT-RICHARD WEISS): The Spice Girls have reunited, willing to put 
their solo careers on hold for a while.  Yes, in spite of popular demand, 
they're back.  As for the use of black holes, order Army 
Galicia-Rumania-Black 
Sea-Constantinople-Bulgaria-Serbia-Budapest-Vienna-Trieste-Albania-Greece, 
with Fleet Adriatic Sea also supporting via nine black holes.  Now was that 
so hard? 

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK GROVELS to PETA): No animals were harmed during the 
performance of this hoax.

<p>
(JODY to SANDY): Two nukes for little ol' me? How thoughtful! Here's a hint
for next round: I'm out of it. You can stop nuking me.

<p>
(ANDY-BOOB): A reminder that I am willing to standby for positions of 3 dots or 
less ONLY.  By the way, I hope you are happy at totally ruining my chances to 
win a second Konig Award for best player performance.  I wish you could have 
waited until after the voting to expose the hoax.  I have also updated Sara's 
Member Profile on AOL.  The name of her city has been changed back to Carson. 
Her sex has been changed from ``female" to ``unavailable."  Her hobbies have 
been updated to include games like Diplomacy, 18xx, Outpost, Acquire, and 
Iron Dragon.  Her occupation has been changed to ``suffering fools gladly," a 
tip of the hat to Phil Reynolds and John Boardman.  The only thing that has 
not been changed is her Personal Quote.  That remains ``Trust Me!"  I hope you 
approve.

<p>
(AUSTRIA-HARRY): I sure wish I had one more nuke to dump not on your 
but on your ``cats."  Man, with that press about the cats, I realize that 
you are not Harry either.  You are a famous Railway Rivals persona come 
back to Dip.  I recognize the pattern of word usage, tangential 
thoughts expressed and misguided self-explorations.  Robert, why didn't 
you come clean when I visited you in the desert?

<p>
(G-L-O-R-I-A to HARRY):  You are just the man I've been looking for.  
Come marry me.  Of course, if you outlive me, the courts may disallow 
your inheriting anything.  Is marriage legal between the same sex if one 
has had a sex change?  What about if only pretended?  This is a real 
case going through the courts now.

<p>
(FRANCE - ALL YOU NICE FOLKS): Thanks for the five points.

<p>
(JODY to MIKE):  Amazing! In the lead and no one nuked you. You must be a great
diplomat. Looks like you have a good chance to win it.

<p>
(TRUSTED PLAYER to BOOBIE):  Do you allow black orders of Nukes?  
<i>((No.))</i>
Can I trust that if a country has nuked me that it was really that player and 
not someone masquerading?  
<i>((Yes, but I make no guarantee that the country/player connection
is a legally verified person.
Should I have to legally verify you?))</i>
First press and now nuke orders.  
Have you no line in the sand?
<i>((I have lots of lines in the sand, but I have a confession to make.
Anything goes in the name of fun, realizing that they may not all be 
to your liking....))</i> 

<p>
(JODY to ALL): I have a confession too. I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.

<p>
(BOOB to ALL): Darn, he beat me to it, I was going to confess to that instead!

(REPORTING FROM MOSCOW):
``What a surprise! Moscow has been taken!  The battle is over.
The Russian army 
had began to march out of the city, but a strong network of defenses were 
still in place.
The Austrian ballalions were having a hard time.
I witnessed a 10,000 man Infantry charge against machine gun nests 
(The Austrians lost a lot of good soldiers). 
A kind of stalemate ensued until a most fascinating event occurred.
A lone rider galloping at full stride shot through our ranks 
and headed to the South of the city...
It is reported that this man was screaming Stop!!!...
A few minutes passed and suddenly a huge explosion resounded.
Men were scattered.
Horses were knocked down.
The General of the 7th army group lost his bathtub as a Russian horse 
flew through the air and landed on his tent.
Such was the destruction...
What followed was a cheer that turned into a crescendo which drove off 
the Cossacks and allowed the taking of Moscow.
But, this does not end on a highnote.
The man who had galloped into Russian lines, the man who flew through 
machine gun nests and the man who is believed to have caused the explosion 
is none other than General Harry Flashman.

(BULGARIA, 26 KILOMETERS WEST OF SOFIA): 
The Turkish general stood, open-mouthed, as he gazed
at the grisly scene before him. ``Too far from the
front, this is impossible", the general stammered as
he walked forward to examine the scene.  Other officers
in the Turkish army followed the general as they all
gazed down upon the blood, shattered head, grey matter
and skull fragments, torn silk clothing, and copious
quantities of brown, fuzzy hair strewn all about. 
The general got down on his hands and knees in a
trance-like state. ``Strange", he said more to himself
than to the crowd of officers behind him, ``the grey
matter of the Sultan appears charred, blackened,
almost cooked". The General was helped to his feet by
a colonel who noted that ``The Austrian artillery that
killed him must have also charred his brain, Sir". 
The General, still pale and wide eyed, shook his head.
``The man's brain has been charred not by Austrian
artillery but by years and years of chronic hashish
abuse, my dear colonel". A silence descended upon the
small crowd of officers until suddenly, from who knows
where, a high soprano voice rang out, ``He's ALL THE
WAY now! ALL THE WAY!" The officers sought in vain the
source of this odd voice as ravens and magpies picked
at the smaller chunks of fat and flesh and lifted
their wings to take their feast to a less busy area.  

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL JON RHODEHAMEL to THE OPPOSING FRENCH ARMY GROUP IN SILESIA):
``The 15th.Lancers and my own 1st.army group are wondering what are you doing

Why are you near Austrian borders?..
The High Command is concerned which means that I have ordered field hospitals 
back to the Western part of Galicia...

<p>
Dear Sirs,
Please follow up with any ideas that you can about making this peace 
initiative a success. I am devoid of any ideas or thoughts on how to proceed.

<p>
I originally was quite excited to attend the emergency European power summit 
in Baltimore at the WDC to see if a peace could be settled.  Upon arrival, 
however, I was disappointed to only see members of the Turkish and Russian 
delegations.

<p>
The entire attempt, if you could call it that, was undertaken by known peace 
advocate Jim Burgess.  His vacant stare and frequent inquiries into the 
availability of the women of the conference set the tone for the weekend.  
<i>((I was just looking for Sara....))</i>
When he kept calling us brothers on starship earth I began to wonder about 
the influence of psychotropic substances.
<i>((Otherwise known as Mint Juleps.... somehow the whole bottle of
Kentucky spirits - Maker's Mark of course - was gone by the last morning.
Must have been the Ghost of Fassio....))</i>

<p>
The Turkish ambassador  Sultan Barno was out of sorts and would not stop 
screaming for the head of the Archduke.  His entire assassination plot was 
foiled since Kent was a no show. Fortunately, no one but a servant sat at his 
chair and the falling scythe made a horrible mess that took hours to clean up.

<p>
Once the conference resumed and Barno was given a sound scolding for his 
actions that were interpreted as a lack of seriousness about the peace 
process it only got worse. The Russian, Tsar Reynolds, simply sat in a corner 
cursing all of humanity. Something about the impossible situation his 
predecessor had left him. Early on I found if I could just keep his glass 
full of Vodka I would be all right.  If it was not for the ghastly odor from 
what he called his ``Unpleasantness" talks with him may have yielded some 
fruit.

<p>
The French came with high hopes to understand the mysterious and evasive Pope 
Munson.  We had been told that the Christians tried to keep the faith by 
observing a modicum of truth but we have yet to see it.  Sadly, He too was a 
no show.

<p>
Any talks that could have happened broke down when Tsar Reynolds threw a 
vodka bottle at Sultan Barno and accused him of not keeping the southern 
border secure.  Barno then made some disparaging remarks about Reynolds 
parentage and a melee ensued. All the while Burgess was under the table with 
the beer wench.  
<i>((I was so busy buying beer for Sean ``Blue'' Cable, the Irish contingent,
and Gihan that I forgot to buy a beer for Emmert.... that damned beer wench
got me all confused....))</i>
I excused myself when another poor servant happened to take 
a brief rest in Kent�s chair again.

<p>
Tomorrow is the last day of the conference, French brothers please send any 
thoughts that may justify my presence here.
I am sending this letter with my trusted advisor Steve Emmert, I know he will 
keep it safe for only French eyes.

<p>
(JAMES to BOOB):  This was a lot more fun when I was steamrolling across
France and into the Med.  I sort of feel like the British ``Empire" in the
50s and 60s - pulling back from everywhere.  The only big difference is that
I have no friendly America to fall back on.

<p>
(BOOB to JAMES): Indeed.  
It does keep things interesting for the spectators though.

<p>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY): I took a couple of gambles and hope that maybe just one
of them will pay off.  Realistically, though, I expect to have neither Spain
nor the North Sea.  How did I do?

<p>
(GERMANY - ENGLAND): If this wasn't Diplomacy I'd call you a ``hypocrite".

<p>
(ENGLAND to TURKEY): Hang tight and gather your strength.  Look what happened
to France, maybe it could happen to you as well.

<p>
(GERMANY - FRANCE): I hope you're right, but I'm betting `no'.

<p>
(BOOB to GO-EL): Why whatever could the Man from Krypton mean??

<p>
(GERMANY - ITALY): Still there Paul?  I'd have thought that I'd have heard
from you after I stabbed England, since you'd been encouraging me to do that
forever.

<p>
(ITALY to AUSTRIA): I may as well take it out on you....

<p>
(AUSTRIA - RUSSIA): Hey Russ, Goz mentioned that he
takes press with a fine grain of salt. So how about we
bury the hatchet, call a truce and start heading
towards Berlin? Until then I hope ya don't mind I
revisit the great lands of Russia. The Ukraine for
instance. Surely we can be freinds again some day
wouldn't you say? 

<p>
(RUSS - KURT): I'll be glad to work with you as soon as you 
remember what the truth is. 
I would have thought it impossible but your worse than your brother. 
Can't remember if there are any, but I'd hate to run into any younger Ozogs.

<p>
(BOOB to OZOGS): I don't recall any younger Ozog's either, but the older
one is off fighting fires, perhaps Russ can convince Kurt to join Eric
and change the dynamic....

<p>

we found it.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Mark grabs the first sprint prize, but it is going to take awhile for
some of the riders to catch up to him as this is about the lousiest 
replenishment I've seen yet.

<p>
2) While Buhrt technically is dropped from the pack, we'll keep him riding
so we can see how far back he gets ;-0

<p>
3) When I add your replenishment card from now on, it always will be the LAST
card in your list. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BUHRT to BRIT PACK): Buhrt is an attempt to spell the name Burt as it
would be pronounced in the north country of Maine.  I'm no good at
writing phonetics, so I can't be clearer on the sound, but it is a very
distinctive accent.  There was a series of comedy records from the 50's
entitled ``Burt and I" that have some great examples of the dry, laconic
backwoods humor associated with that area.  The inhabitants of the 
northern reaches of Vermont (my family home) and New Hampshire are said
to share a number of these traits.

<p>
(WHITE RABBIT - DARRELL): Cooks with gas, does he?

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): MAYFAIR GAMES INC, whose web site is
http://www.coolgames.com/, has licensed EDEN STUDIOS to produce a computer
game version of IRON DRAGON.  This is a fun game. Visit
http://www.irondragon.org/ for more information, updates, and to download
a demo version.   

<p>
(MR. HOWELL - MR. OBSERVATION): Where, exactly, do I submit these
applications?

<p>
(MANIACS - ALICE): I was counting my assets, not my income.  My income
has been pathetic, my assets are merely deplorable!

<p>
(JOHN-MARCH HARE):  You may be fast, but you're a hard target to miss!

<p>
(HARE - RABBIT): My pleasure.  Just don't give any to the Hatter before
he scores some points for us.

<p>
(TFWS - HATTER): Speed.... is relative.

<p>
(RABBIT - BOOB(1)): ``Off with her head!"  Or, was that, ``I want her
head!"   Geez, I think I'm getting my movies confused...

<p>
(RABBIT - BOOB(2)):  Just makes it worse, doesn't it?!

http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Magic, fear and superstition, this is
the Curse of the Mekons; 
You'll be visited by our crew, it's no joke I'm telling you;
On your stone heads and leaky hearts, we'll leave our mark to say we called.''
From ``The Curse'' which is of course the title track of <i>The Curse of
the Mekons</i> and I've chosen it JUST for Jeff.....

<p>
(EGYPT to MEKONS): I have a deal for you.
You stop writing the Mekons bullshit and I'll stop writing my Star
Trek bullshit.
Deal?

<p>
(BOOB to JEFF): But I ***LIKE*** your Star Trek press.....
and I ***LOVE*** the Mekons.
I think you're out of luck....

<p>
(EGYPT to STARFLEET): Have initiated defensive maneuvers that temporarily
confused the enemy.
My shields have been refortified but without immediate assistance.....

<p>
(UKR - ITALY): Good luck fighting those fires.  Just think of it as a 
little preview of where all your hapless victims have gone!

<p>
(DAVE - JIM/JEFF): I'm not sure what Jeff's question is.  Certainly
a retreating unit can take a supply center, it moves to any legal
space and the adjustment phase is a separate phase that takes place
after retreats.  Is there something hidden about this question that
I missed?

<p>
(JEFF - JIM): After reading your response to my note, I said to myself:
``he's crazy''.
So I went to my 30 year old rule book to prove you wrong.
I opened it up, read the appropriate section, only to determine
that you and everyone else is correct and that my little Diplomacy
group has been playing the game wrong on and off for about the
last 20 years.
Like I told Dave, stupid is as stupid does.
My apologies...
<i>((None are required.
Hey, I'm not perfect either (and I don't know why I keep getting 
accused lately of BELIEVING that I'm perfect....).
We're pleased to clear up your confusion, but you can't go back
in time and retreat into your nephew's center. 
Sorry about that!))</i>

<p>
(UKR - EGYPT): Ahh, the old hunker down and pretend I'm small so no
one will notice me trick actually worked!  The royal marines stripped
those ships and made spears out of them while you were out taking
those siestas the Spaniards got you hooked on.

<p>
(SPAIN-BOARD): No I don't need to yell help for you'll to come over you'll are 
coming anyway.

<p>
(UKRAINE to SPAIN): Why be in a hurry, there's plenty of time to 
attack everyone, they just have to wait their turn.

<p>
(BRITAIN-WORLD): Anyone who tries to take advantage of my calculated
withdrawals intended to stall the Germans is, quite frankly, a
stupid arse.
And it's quite out of character for me to say so.

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to SPAIN): It's too late for Britain to keep me out of 
his homeland.  I'm lapping at his shores right now....

<p>
(EGYPT - SPAIN): I disagree with your observation statement about this being an
interesting war.  The alliance of Germany (see no evil!), Ukraine (speak no evil!),
and Italy (evil!) is going to wipe us out.
This will be interesting only in the way it was interesting feeding 
the Christians to the Lions.

<p>
(JEFF to KENT): You know I'm starting to feel ``guilty'' for the way
I stabbed you.
It wasn't something I planned, it was an act of impatience and to some
degree, boredom.
I just want you to know that if I had it to do over again I never 
would have turned my back on you!
(Actually if I had it to do over again I would have attacked you 
on the first move like Dave suggested.)

<p>
(EGYPT - ITALY): If you don't get your fleets (that would be the
guys with the capital I's right?)
<i>((That's right.... capitals for fleets, small letters for armies.))</i>
out of my territorial waters I will be forced to consider your actions
an act of unfriendliness!

<p>
(ITALY to UKRAINE): Help!

<p>
(EGYPT - SPAIN II): Repeat after me, this is diplomacy, there are no
nukes, this is diplomacy, there are no nukes, this....

<p>
(EGYPT - FRANCE): I should be delighted but for no reason I 
can explain I'm a little apprehensive about the possibility
of a Republican sweep.
Go figure!

<p>
(EGYPT - FRANCE II): I'm actually not a big fan of the massive
tax cut proposed by the Republicans but don't you think the marriage
tax should be eliminated?
I think Clinton really should have signed that one.
What do you think.
<i>((I'll comment on some of this series of notes.
I consider myself a liberal Republican, one of those endangered
species, but one that the Gore/Lieberman platform is playing to
pretty strongly.
I can't stand the idea of the massive tax cut and though I might
agree about the marriage tax, I doubt that Harry cares much,
not being married himself.))</i>

<p>
(ERIC-JIMBOB AND HARRY): Yeah, I admit I fell for ``Sara."  Yes, I
acknowledge Harry's creation was genius.  Harry may think he was clever
in first seducing then stabbing me, but actually his satisfaction from
the ``stab" is dubious.  This is because I was in the process of yet 
another one of my downward postal burnout slides, had stopped writing,
and dropped out of the game.  I didn't ``roll over" because of Sara's
sweet stab (step on me baby, in your stiletto heels!) but from what I
recall, Harry/Sara had written me a couple times before deciding to use
the knife and had only abandoned the alliance upon getting no reply from
me,  which was reasonable.  Anyway, this is from my perspective (I do
have my reputation to maintain, you know!).  I wonder if Harry saved my
love letters to Sara?

by E-Mail this turn, but he should be settled again by the Fall turn.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(``ONLY IN AMERICA KIBBITZER" - PLAYERS): Are you having fun yet?  Your press
doesn't indicate so!  DO you agree that this is a sorry map - unworthy of being
distributed, much less played.  Jim-Booby, is this the last time you will 
consider running such a travesty?  I hope so.  
<i>((As of now, definitely yes.))</i>
Are there any statistics for PBM results?  
<i>((They are out there for E-Mail games and they are pretty pathetic.
There were some statistics calculated for ``balance'' which basically meant
that every power had an equal chance of participating in the draw.
Colonial came out WAY, WAY more unbalanced than just about any variant.
Modern is pretty balanced though.))</i>
All the games I saw or played in were very similar to this.  NO hope for the
inside countries in the long-term.  Great advantage to Holland and Japan 
(who technically can't be eliminated).  Short term hope for Russia.  
Turkey nearly a middle country.    

<p>
(KURTUGAWA - TSAR DAWN): Nah, probably wouldn't work
either. Women can be equally very controlling,
manipulative and deceptive (any one else wanna throw
in .02 on that??). Then again, how about a strip tease
for everyone in the game...?? 

<p>
(TOKYO TIMES - WORLD): After a prolongued tour of duty
in the Pacific observing the island Formosa, the
Imperial Fleet of the Upper Pacific returns home for
some well deserved leave. This comes down as a gesture
of trust between the Empire and our ally to the south.
 
<p>
(J - F): It's no wonder I've been consistently tired all
these months...! 

<p>
(OZOGSAN - TSAR DON AND RICK): Okay. All joking aside...
Whatever it takes to finish this. 

<p>
(UPDATE FROM AMSTERDAM):

<p>
Kenny has been raking in money at the casino, Chef and Big Gay
Al have headed off to the Red Light District, Mr. Mackey is looking
for Stan in a hash bar, and Cartman and Kyle are slapping each other
silly in the hotel.

<p>
(Red Light District, Chef and Al come walking along one of the
many canals):

<p>
Prostitute: Hey big guys, you want to party?

<p>
Chef:  Sure, partying sounds like fun.  

<p>
Al:  Hmm...I don't think this is my kind of party.  But that
``Spartacus Club" looks interesting.  (Leaves for gay bar.)

<p>
Pro:  For only 50 guilders, b*** and f***.  

<p>
Chef:  Hell, woman, I'd give you that for free!  You can keep your
money.

<p>
Pro:  No - <i>you</i> give <i>me</i> the money!

<p>
Chef: Why on Earth would I do that?  Isn't sweet loving with Chef
enough for you?  Damn, woman, you want everything!  (starts to
walk away).

<p>
Pro:  Wait!  A special discount!  25 guilders!

<p>
Chef keeps walking

<p>
Pro:  Wait, wait!   (Chef walks away, hooker running after him.)
