of the song that sorrow sings.''
From ``Nothing Lasts Forever'' off of the most recent 
Echo and the Bunnymen record <i>Evergreen</i>.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I'll spare you the details and just say welcome to yet another
``post super issue'' fling of the best little szine in Rhode 
Island.
Deadlines will stay on track and I'll try not to forget Mike
Barno or hold the subber and trader issues so long this time.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

Through Jamie McQuinn's Postal portion of the Pouch:

<p>
the szine resides in html format.  
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually 
in the near future.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to #186 are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the 
pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP directory in compressed postscript format.
I will be putting all of these issues up in html format at the aforementioned
site and more.
We'll get all that straightened out soon.
The gracious assistance of Kevin Roust is most appreciated
in keeping up this site.
The files begin ap131.ps.Z and go sequentially from there.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR DAN STAFFORD</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>I've been hunting around for Dan Stafford sayings and have been
having a bit of trouble.  
Dan was not the biggest ``hobbyist'' in the world in the sense
of being an active writer. 
He mostly wrote in games to negotiate.
While doing that hunting around, by the way, I did find that Bruce
Linsey's ``big'' issue was 170 pages, beating out my puny #200
by pages and pages - yet a good chunk of it was just his houserules.
Some of Larry Peery's efforts were larger as well.
Still, my recollection of both of those large efforts is that they
had lots of filler.
Although I reprinted some choice material, it was all carefully chosen
and I don't think there was a bit of filler.
Everyone's entitled to their opinions of course, but #200 didn't set
any official records.

<p>
So, Dan Stafford.... what better quote than from his Fall 1905 orders from 
1982 HS, the Hotshit, as Germany.  These garnered him a build in London
as part of a plan with France and Russia to put Paul Rauterberg's
England OUT OF THE GAME!
Worse yet, the plan worked.
How could he be so mean and nasty?
That's Dan....
f nth-LON, a SIL S a mun, a MUN h, a vie-GAL, a bel-RUH, f den-BAL,
a nwy-SWE, F NWG S RUSSIAN f edi.... shoots to nine centers, build one.
Paul, I'll bet you could have done without being reminded of that game.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 30 Poynter Road, Bush Hill Park,
Enfield, Middlesex  EN1 1DL, UK (johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk).
The representives in Australia 
(John Cain, PO Box 4317, Melbourne University 3052,
AUSTRALIA) or Belgium and some other European countries
(Jef Bryant, Rue Jean Pauly, 121, B-4430 ANS, BELGIUM) 
also will forward your subscription on to the editor in either
Australian dollars or continental European 
currencies respectively.
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<p>
Obviously, I'm not anywhere close to getting back around to doing
international szine reviews, but who knows, I might pick it up
again at any time.
I still actively am searching for more international traders.
In the meantime, there is a newly independent szine from the
infamous Tony Dickinson.
I have the honor of being the VERY first trader for <i>The Asylum
Zone</i>!
If any Americans want to play, Tony has a Gunboat game open
and you Brits better get on the stick and trade with poor Tony,
left adrift by Kim Head's folding of <i>Life's Rich Pageant</i>.
Tony may be found at 78 Pontefract Road, Purston, Featherstone,
West Yorkshire, UK  WF7 5AP.
Tony has my kinda attitude toward subs, szines, and especially
Chumbawamba!
Check him out!!

Jim:  I have to hand it to Modern Diplomacy.  There is more
negotiating going on here than in the rest of my current Dip games
combined!  Perhaps the email element, and the number of players with
email addresses, has something to do with it.
     
Remember, I started looking for variants because I was dissatisfied
with the amount of communications being undertaken in the regDip
games.  
I'm happy to have found an outlet for my scheming mind....
     
In Doug Kent's variant zine <i>Grand Hyatt</i>, 
I'm currently involved in the worldwide Seven Years' War 
variant Colonia VII.   
Out of the nine players in that game, only half are writing (or emailing, or phoning) others, and that half is winning the game!  
I hope that people can take this lesson to heart....
<i>((Indeed.
I can't stand playing in games where people won't communicate.
I try my best to foster the ``right'' kind of game here.))</i>

<b>Eric Brosius (Tue, 21 Apr 1998 17:48:03 -0400)</b>

<p>
Jim,  I'm looking for some advice.  
I recently got the music for Beethoven's piano sonatas 
(in three volumes by the Associated Branch of the Royal School 
of Music-an expensive edition but an extremely readable one, 
which is important if one plans to spend a lot of time playing it.)  
I have been pleased to find that I can almost play some of them,
including a recognizable attempt at almost all of Opus 26 
in A flat, which is one of my favorite pieces of music.

<p>
I realize that it would be a big help to have this music in 
recorded form by someone who can actually play it.  
I looked in a local music store, and I'm not sure 
what version of this I should purchase.  
I would prefer to get all of the piano sonatas together, 
rather than a compilation of ``favorites,''
especially since the ones I can play are not 
likely to match the favorites.
(In particular, the ``Moonlight'' is accessible in the 
first two movements but formidable in the third, and the
``Pathetique'' and ``Appassionata'' are also too hard for me.)  
I would also prefer an edition in which the music is played 
in a straightforward fashion, and one in which 
I can hear what is being played.

<p>
I suspect you or your readers may be able to make suggestions.  
I realize that I can listen to some of this music in the store, 
but on the whole it's a lot of listening and I'd like some 
direction before I start out.  
I'd appreciate any comments.

<p>

<p>
Yikes!  NPR!  No!

<p>
Jim-Bob, are you saying that the deadline was Saturday?  
<i>((Yes.))</i>
If so, then I think I've NMRed, too.  
But no, now that I look at the zine again, I see that
it's just for builds, and (sob!) I don't get none o' them.  
So press it is.

<p>
<i>((Heh, heh, heh, do you think I got anyone's attention
with my note above?
You might have a comment or two on Mr. Beethoven.
And thanks for the press.... and this letter.))</i>

<p>
And I still haven't given you my desert island disc list.
<i>((No, you haven't.))</i>

<p>
1.  Vince Guaraldi, <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas.</i>  
Some nice jazz throughout, but mostly for the versions 
of ``Greensleeves" and, of course, ``Linus and Lucy."

<p>
2.  Pat Metheny Group, <i>Letter From Home.</i>  
The best jazz recording in my collection, better even than Miles Davis's 
<i>Seven Steps to Heaven.</i>

<p>
3.  <i>Rigoletto,</i> with Cesare Siepi as Sparafucil.  
Now THAT man is a bass.  
This opera has one of the most famous arias in all of classical
music, ``La Donna e Mobile," and Act I, scene 2 is an unparallelled
bass-baritone/bass duet.

<p>
4.  The Deutsche Grammophon release of Tchaikovsky's <i>The
Nutcracker.</i>  (Gee, that makes two ostensibly Christmas pieces.)  
So many memorable tunes are in this ballet.  
It breaks my heart to leave out Wagner's <i>Die Walkure,</i> but 
something's gotta give, and I ain't leaving for
no damn island without some P&#235;tr Ilich.

<p>
5. and 6.  Two live rock recordings, <i>The Allman Brothers Band Live 
at Fillmore East,</i> and Deep Purple's <i>Made in Japan.</i>  
The Allmans did some wonderful jazz/blues fusion, and 
``In Memory of Elizabeth Reed'' is, in my view, the best 
instrumental in this genre.  <i>Made in Japan</i> does
NOT include ``Woman from Tokyo," but has just seven tunes on four
album sides.  Do the math; there's some serious jamming.  Twenty
minutes of the best Purple tune, ``Space Truckin'."  I almost included
another live recording, <i>Raunch 'n' Roll</i> by Black Oak Arkansas, for two
reasons:  A fabulous guitar duet in ``When Electricity came to Arkansas,"
and since I bet no one ever submitted  a single Black Oak recording since
you started this thing.  
<i>((You are absolutely correct, sir!))</i>
But alas! there's no room for Jim Dandy and the boys.

<p>
7.  <i>Regatta de Blanc</i> by the Police is my favorite Cop album.  
It doesn't have my favorite of their tunes (``When the World 
Is Running Down . . ." from <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i>) and isn't as 
raw as their first album, but it's an hour of consistently good music.
  
8.  (Sigh.)  I can't have any more?  Then give me <i>Blind Faith.</i>  
This wins narrowly over two Traffic albums, <i>John Barleycorn Must Die</i> 
and <i>The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys.</i>  
The title track to the last one is probably my favorite rock tune, 
but with the exception of ``Hidden Treasure," there just isn't enough 
else on the album.  <i>Blind Faith,</i> by comparison, is comprised 
entirely of keepers.
This list assumes that I'll be able to take my wife with me to the island.  
If not, I'll substitute the recording (Arabesque) of Mendelssohn's 
<i>Die Erste Walpurgisnacht</i> on which she appears.  
The others are just music, but there is no substitute for the sound 
of my wife's voice.

<p>
And now I have to mourn at what I leave behind:  There's no English
Beat, so I'll just have to keep humming ``Dream Home in New Zealand" to
myself.  No Chuck Berry, no Muddy Waters, no ``Magnificent Seven" by
the Clash, no ``Fingerprint File" or ``Monkey Man" by the Stones.  Seal's
``Crazy" and the New Bohemians' ``What I Am" will be dim memories.  No
ZZTop?  What was I thinking??? I have to go back and rewrite this whole
list now.  How 'bout if I just take eight DOZEN discs with me?  Huh?

<p>
I didn't realize how hard it would be to compile that desert island disc list. 
Driving to work this morning, I realized that I also left out Mozart, Monk, 
Debussy, Brubeck, Led Zeppelin - AAARRRRGH!  Eight dozen.  That's
about the minimum.

<p>
Thanks again for the dreaded NPR warning.  Best wishes.

<p>
Jim,
Finally finished <i>TAP</i> over the week-end.  
Made me feel rich to think of all the money I had saved not 
being as keen on music as you are.  Then again, 
think of all the musical experiences I have missed out on.
<i>((As I type this, I look at the wall full of vinyl, 
estimated about 3000 records.... then downstairs are most
of the CD's - at least 500 of those.))</i>

<p>
There seem to be a lot of Anglophiles - at least in terms of music - among 
your readership.  Who'd have thought the Beat would still be referred to so 
often well over a decade past their hey-day?  In Britain although they were 
a successful band they always ranked behind the big 2: Madness and the 
Specials.  I wouldn't say they are forgotten but if they are remembered at 
all it is largely because they gave birth to the Fine Young Cannibals and 
one of the most irritating vocalists the world of pop has ever endured, 
namely Roland Gift.  He sings like his gums have been anaesthetised.
<i>((You got it exactly right.
Madness and the Specials [the latter has a great new album out!] are
quite remarkable bands too, but the Beat had Sax.))</i>

<p>
Anyway, Dave Wakeling (guitarist/singer) with the Beat has got a new band 
called BANG! which is supposed to be more in the vein of the Beat than was 
his other band, General Public.

<p>
My most memorable ska moment was being downstairs at a party when they 
played ``Night Train to Cairo" by Madness.  A room full of about 40 people 
stomping away simultaneously upstairs don't half put the fear of god in you; 
I'm amazed the floorboards held out.

<p>
Dear Boob, Well, the smallish issue of <i>TAP</i> arrived today.
Congrats on making 200.

<p>
So where does one start?
Fun S01 adjudication for Arsenic and Old Farts.
I would love to have seen the diplomacy for that.
<i>((It was a bit wild.))</i>
Will the Boob fail to build as France!!
<i>((Yes.))</i>
Why do Yanks always open to the channel as England?!
<i>((We don't.))</i>
I'm pleased you're printing the reports as I'm sure it's going to be
amusing.

<p>
I'm sure it wasn't me who put you on to Ferrick.
Surely Mark Wightman?
<i>((I believe that is correct.
Sorry about the brain fart.
You Brits all look alike.... hyork, hyork, hyork!))</i>
Who will be wetting himself with jealousy if you haven't sent him a copy 
of Ferrick's new album.
<i>((I presume he found it himself.
He hasn't mentioned it to me.))</i>

<p>
If you were so desperate to know about the Brooke song you should have
emailed me.
<i>((I listen to cassettes mostly in the car.
I haven't wired myself into the Internet from my car and am unlikely to
do so in the future.
It kept slipping my mind to E-Mail you about it.))</i>
It is a great song, isn't it?
I got it from a tribute album to Laura Nyro.
Lots of girls (Vega, Brooke, Siberry, one of the Roches, etc. etc.) recording
Nyro songs.
I first came across Brooke as part of the story and for some reason I've
got none of her solo stuff (HMV here I come!).
Anyway I should have emailed you by the time you get this.
<i>((The email appeared last issue, of course.))</i>

<p>
The British hobby is in a bit of turmoil at the moment with some
major folds.
<i>Life's Rich Pageant</i> was the one that really surprised me.
<i>((Not me, although I had hopes I was wrong.))</i>

<p>
The latest from the US front in <i>Western Front</i> is one Dennis
Cain complaining that America pays too much heed
to world opinion.
<i>((What??!!))</i>
He was referring to the Tokyo pollution summit.
Strikes me as odd really how the US can complain when it has 5% of
the population and 20-25% of the pollution.
<i>((Oh, but if you count on the Invisible Hand to control such
equilibria and value personal choice over societal benefit it is
really easy for many individuals to end up there.
Your use of the term ``the US'' doesn't make any sense to me in
this context. 
You don't hear that opinion from the President or Vice President,
nor is it universally held in the population.
People in the US DO optimistically count on technology to solve the
pollution problem before it kills us all.
In general, pollution is much lower in the US than it was 30 years ago.))</i>
I have the feeling that Mr. Cain is of the ``nuke the bastards'' philosophy.
Oddly one <i>W.F.</i> subber was prepared to indulge in a bit of
anti-American Rhetoric.
Guess who?
Anyway, Brad Martin is next on my list!

<p>
As you know (?) I don't have access to email direct and one of my colleagues
sends it out for me (I send it to him via the mainframe).
<i>((Actually, no, I didn't know that.))</i>
When I sent you the email asking for info on US voting rights I got the
response from him ``Pete after living in the US for 3 years, I found
few Americans who had interest in the rest of the world.''
<i>((This generally is true, but there are pockets of interest and
New England tends to be one of them.
Lately, I haven't been listening to the BBC World Service as much as
I used to, but I still try to catch at least the headlines every day.))</i>

<p>
The Erin McKeown sounds interesting but no way for me to get a copy
(uh hum).
<i>((Oh, stop that, when I get a chance, I do intend to get a few 
extra copies of her tape and you are on the list of people to 
which I want to pop them off.))</i>
Sarah McLachlan, like Jonatha Brooke, is someone I like but haven't
bought recently.
How about shoving the McKeown/Ferrick on a tape for me and Wightman.
Actually I've got a couple of McLachlan albums upstairs....

<p>
Who is this Mr. Duxon character John Schultz is on about?
Oh me!
C'mon, John, I'm meant to be the stuffy formal one.
I'm well aware of my country's history.
There are many things I'm not proud of.
My beef against the US is not that it has flaws but that some of
your countrymen believe that America is the most perfect country
in the world and that God made it so.
<i>((Hang on a second there, I think you're twisting the VERY 
common result that if you ask Americans if there is any place 
in the world they'd rather live than here, they say no.
Even I say no to that question.
That is NOT the same thing as saying this is the most perfect 
country (polls would show we DON'T think that).
As for the God part?
I'd have to think about that more, but don't think you have a
point there either.
You also have to remember how diverse this country is.
I believe that there is more diversity in the US than in the EU.
This most emphatically does not make us perfect, but it does mean
you can find many, many, many things here.))</i>
I think I made the point to Brent McKee once that the US reminds
me of Britain at the height of Empire (Look at what the British
did in India for goodness sake).
I have great fun tweaking some American noses but mostly it's
good natured.
<i>((I know.))</i>
I'm aware that there are a lot of race attacks especially in
British cities.
I suppose I was making the old people in glass houses comment.
However, I've been chatting to a guy at work who is Hong Kong
Chinese by descent and some of what happened with passports 
sounds out of order to me.
<i>((Do you now agree with what Brad Wilson and I were saying
last year?))</i>

<p>
Rich Goranson's recommendation for Capercaillie reminded me to ask you if I
stuck a Karen Matheson track on the tape?
It's a cracker.
<i>((No, you didn't!))</i>

<p>
The irritating thing of reading this <i>TAP</i> was all the music I'm
going to have to put in the car or bring downstairs.
I really need to win the lottery so I can move to the New Forest or
the Wye Valley and spend a year with my hifi and a stack of books.
I'll be in the car for 3 hours or so Saturday so I'll load some tapes into
the car.
<i>((I think those locations were lost on us over here, but great!
Good to put pressure on your wallet.
Any time...))</i>

<p>
Bloody hell, the teletubbies getting a mention in <i>TAP</i>!!
<i>((Why not?
It's a little bit surrealistic and trippy and so are we here.))</i>
Apparently it's unsuitable for American kids as everyone is nice to 
everyone in Teletubby Land and the real world is nasty.
Weird.
Maybe I should send you a copy of the Tubbies single.
Better lyrics than Chumbawamba for one.
Tony Dickinson is now foaming at the mouth.
<i>((Me too!
Tubbies talk is silly baby talk, as you know.
I kinda like the Chums lyrics.
Teletubbies have been sweeping the country in certain circles here.
Strangely, as far as I understand, it has not generated that much
protest except among the ``ultraliberal'' set since it is appearing
on our ``public television''.))</i>

<p>
Well, we've had our first full Labour budget for 20 years!
Well it wasn't socialist!
This for the benefit of most of your US leaders is the British
use of socialist.
The American use is communist, I believe.
Given I work for a company that sells stock market investments I 
could sense palpable relief.
Hard to know what to call it really, there was a risk I'd get hit on
one or two things but I can still afford to sub.
Hell, I did vote for them, actually they could have been a bit 
more radical.
Really.

<p>
Well, time to get a cup of tea and take a train Journey through Mexico

I have to disagree with you: George Washington <i>was</i> very important,

I refer to two occasions.
The first came when his troops, owed back pay, wanted to march on the
government, seize its assets,
<i>((What assets!!!???))</i>
and install Washington as king; he dissuaded them.
The second occasion was at the war end, when he set up the order
of the Cincinnati and encouraged military leaders to return to their
civilian lives, leading by example.
Had he allowed himself to be swept by the tide in either case, had 
he set himself up as another Napoleon, the democratic experiment
probably would never have gotten off the ground, and might have been
written off worldwide as being infeasible.
<i>((Absolutely correct.
I was certainly aware of those events, and should have given them
the weight which you did.
The debate, if you recall, though was about the quality of military
leaders and I was taking a ``standard'' approach to evaluating their
performance in war.
You properly were taking account of the bigger military picture.))</i>

<p>
77 Dusty Springfield songs?
I'll skip the issue where you do <i>that</i> review, but I did enjoy
``Son of a Preacher Man'' when it was reissued on the <i>Pulp Fiction</i>
soundtrack, one of the more diverse collections out there.
<i>((I won't debate you at length, but I think you'd be surprised
at the breadth and depth of those 77 songs.
It even surprised me and I was prepared for a good chunk of it.))</i>

<p>
I'm amazed that you called some classical-crossover music ``disgusting''
for being ``pretty, but vapid''.
Doesn't that characterize a lot of the music on your lists?
<i>((Of course it does, but I would make two points.
(1) Put any classical-crossover record of your choice up against
any pretty pop record of my choice.
Play them for a third party, I'll bet the pop record sounds better,
touches emotions cleaner, and probably even is less vapid.
I'd probably choose the Sundays record from last year.
I'd judge it myself as well, openly, using my ears.
But, in general, I know who would win.
(2) The training of classical musicians tends to be VERY exacting.
I know about this first hand from being an undergraduate at 
Rochester and hanging out at the Eastman School of Music.
Pop music that is played TOO precisely, without enough loose
flexibility is, of course, too tight.
I listen to classical music to hear classical music and pop music
to hear pop music.
I'm willing to be flexible.
I, as an example, like Wynton Marsalis' interpretations of classical
horn works.
Finally, what I was really thinking about was opera singers.
They are trained to sing in a particular way that I think generally
does not illuminate most pop music.))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
I also would really like to open a game of Breaking Away.
Is there any interest at all??
Well, John Schultz and the game's designer John Harrington
are interested.
Others??
You don't need to own the game to play, I'm going to use 
Keith Thomasson's house rules that include the ``how to play the game.''
I printed Keith's rules a few issues back, but some of the shaded parts
didn't reproduce properly.
I'll print the rules properly if I get a bit more interest in the game.
I thank John Harrington for encouraging me in this.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) As is traditional in getting games started in this szine, you
get three deadlines to get acquainted.
Both of those Autumn and Winter deadlines will accept press.
The first moves are due with Spring on Memorial Day weekend.
Note that puts the deadline on World DipCon weekend.
I will probably be there and not work on the szine until I return.
I last printed the house rules a few issues ago when I started
Show Me the Money.
I can E-Mail or Mail them to anyone who needs to see them.

<p>
2) The above game note is repeated from last time.  
Note the May 30th deadline is when the first actual ORDERS are due.
This gave you two months to get acquainted.
I find that giving that time to get started is crucial in getting
a game off on the right foot.
I've heard that lots of negotiating took off right from the start.
Keep up the good work!

<p>
3) Standbys for this game are the three who didn't get into the
game: Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, and Paul Kenny; plus John Schultz.

<p>
4) To just the players, I have tried to blow up the map and give
you a better map, but this is the best I have and the best I can do.
I will take input on getting higher quality maps from somewhere.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Late at night sitting at the bar
revulsion shuddering thru your body as you try to recall who it was
and what you said - knowing you've talked too much once again...''
from the album quote on <i>Slightly South of the Border</i>.

<p>
(KREMLIN-BOOB): In order to preserve musical integrity and also to 
prevent you from throwing me out of the game, 
I shall decline to provide the Greg Lake quotes that I was planning 
on doing for this game. 
<i>((Forgive me if I don't plead on my hands and knees for you
to reconsider... how about Anthony Phillips quotes such as the
lyrics from ``Regrets''... ``Regrets, our secret cemeteries, where 
loves and loss are silently lain.  The dream is fading faster now,
and soon you'll slip beyond my recall....''))</i>
Thank you.
<i>((You're welcome.))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA-UKRAINE): And don't you start with the musical quotes either. 

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): I must be a disgrace to my Irish ancestors. 
I hope I get tarred and feathered cause it sounds like fun.

<p>
(RUSSIA-POLAND): Now behave...

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): Snake for Poles but they don't Bite with a snakish 
graham, the difference is that we need it down or we all go eat the snake 
and all without much at stake. It is quick, good and hard to see but if 
he gets past me we all shall be punished by thee.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): The map in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83 was only a 
half page and very hard to read.
The full page map in <i>TAP</i> #201 (which I received on 6 April 1998)
is better, but still a hard squint for me.
OK, so I have failing eyesight and all that.
<i>((Sorry, I'm giving it another shot this time, but I don't have
a great source, so reproduction never is perfect.))</i>
So, what I would like to know is if SOMEBODY in your great <i>TAP</i>
readership, either the hard copy or the internet version, might be
able to print up a large size version of the map, sort of 11x17 inches
or something like that and send it to me.
I'd be quite happy to pay some sort of fee for this service,
and it would be a big help.
<i>((How's this one?  It is an 11x17 blow up of my original off
the Internet, I can do no better with what I have.))</i>
Having said that, I did re-read the article on Modern Diplomacy,
peered at the map, and started plotting strategies.
Since you were assigning the countries at random, I could not
ask for France, Germany, or Ukraine, the three weaklings of this
variant, (I DO like challenges) yet ``Andruschak'' is a 
Ukrainian name, after all, and it would have been fun to represent
it in this <i>TAP</i> game.
(And being half Scots, I am very pleased to see ``England'' renamed
``Britain'', as it should have been in the original version.)
<i>((I am also half Ukrainian, but the half NOT represented by
my name, as should be rather obvious.
My mother's family came from the Austrian part of Ukraine... which
is known, of course, as all Diplomacy players know, as Galicia.
The ``Burgess'' part might be part Scots, although I'm not entirely
sure about the genealogy of that part of the family.))</i>
But France is what I have actually been assigned.
Now... what can I do for you in the way of thanks?
How about some good old GM ABUSE!!!
<i>((Why not, get your points in... but why?
What did I do now??))</i>
Reason?
We need a reason?
Since when did we need a reason?
OK, here is a reason; you spelled it ``whiskey'', which implies that
wimpy american stuff like bourbon, as opposed to REAL ``whisky''
like Scotch.
<i>((I assure you that the Mekons are ALL Brit.
It's their spelling I'm using.
As should have been obvious from my previous comments on the subject,
the Mekons are using whiskey impressionistically in its original
sense as the ``water of life'', not at all implying a specific 
distilled spirit.
I always forget the Gaelic word from which it was derived, but
I remember what it means.))</i>
So I give you that King of the French Salutes... ``le bras d'honneur''...
(literally, gesture of esteem, respect, homage)... followed by a Bronx
Cheer for not knowing how to count.
<i>((Huh, count?
Count what??))</i>
I mean, I understand that today's kids are graduating from High School
unable to read, write, or do arithmatic, <i>((sic, or spell...))</i>
but really now, can't you kids even count up to three?
In the game ``Arsenic and Old Farts'' you have three SCs; Portugal,
Brest, and Marseilles.
You have three units on the board.
You do NOT have Paris as a SC.
No builds for you.
And Terry is just as bad for not realizing that the Army in Paris
entitles Germany to THREE builds.
``What do they teach kids in school these days?''
<i>((What???!!!
Yeah, so what?
Germany is indeed doubling up on me in the first year.
All the mathematics are correct.))</i>
Now some questions.
We start this variant with 38 Home Supply Centers.
How many Neutral Supply Centers are there, and how many Supply Centers
are required for a win?
I keep trying to count them but the small size of the map makes it
confusing.
<i>((True, there are about 64 centers in total
and more than half are required for the win.
If I counted right, then 33 centers would be required for the win.
I'm not sure I did count right though.... boy, that is difficult.
Whatever, we'll worry about how many centers someone needs to win
later.))</i>
Next, Modern Diplomacy is supposed to have a large following in the 
PBEM hobby.
Has anyone been keeping statistics as to how the games end?
If so, what are the win percentages for the ten countries?
The draw percentages?
What is the average length of games in terms of game years?
Curious minds want to know.
<i>((Someone want to answer that?
The data is out there in cyberspace, but lately stats have 
been hard to come by as Nick Fitzpatrick has scaled down his
hobby involvement.))</i>
Moving on to uour ``Vocabulary Time'', the ``bitter end'' is the
end of the rope or cable that is wound around a bitt.
A ``bitt'' is a vertical post set on the deck of a ship and used
to secure ropes and cables.
``15 men on the Dead Men's Chest, Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.''
Avast, ye landlubber... when I was sailing on the MANDALAY, the 
Captain asked us to hoist the fishermen.
What did we do to follow these orders?
<i>((Huh?
I'm going to hang onto that inboard end of the anchor rope that's
wrapped around the bitt and scream for all I'm worth!!))</i>
Finally, a sad request.
I wish to be taken off the waiting list for the next NYEED game.
I know you are anxious to get it started, but I think it would
be best if it started without me.
I need to devote my Copious Spare Time to the Modern Diplomacy game.
There is no way I could give the NYEED the proper attention it deserves.
<i>((Done.
I do understand.
It'll start when it starts.))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA-ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED TURKEY/EGYPT/FRANCE): I'm sending 
letters sometime during the week. I promise not to ignore you three. 
You know, I work at the post office and they STILL won't give me 
free stamps. And after all the suffering I do for them!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-ALL OTHER PLAYERS): Welcome, and I hope we have a
fun game with plenty of GM abuse, entertaining press, lots of GM
abuse, the joy of Diplomacy, and (of course) heaps of GM abuse.
However, be warned that I am not often at home if you want to phone me.
I rarely use the phone since I'm too cheap.
I do have an answering machine, and I do screen all calls.
(A legacy from problems with the local sci-fi club.)
I am usually home tuesday and thursday nights, 7-9 PM PDT.
Other nights are likely to see me at AA meetings or out socializing.
(One of the results of not having a TV set for over a dozen years is
an active social life.)
Never call after 9PM Pacific Daylight Savings Time, the phone is
always turned off at 9PM.

<p>
(RUSSIA-BRITAIN): Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): I am waiting to see who is my first likely kill 
next year right now I want to build so better make way for the king of 
all the teenagers in this variant. (This is the smallest kingdom that I 
have ever known.)
  
(RUSSIA-SPAIN): Guantanamera?

<p>
(RUSSIA-THE REST [AKA THE PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN]): Sorry, 
I've run out of my cleverness quotient for this month. 
Stick pins next time...

<p>
(SPAIN to UKRAINE): Jack be cunning jack be quick otherwise the ginger 
will catch up quick.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): Returning to an old topic, it is 
DEUTERONOMY 19:15 that insists on 2 or 3 eyewitnesses.
I have a hunch that 100% of those who want to quote the Bible as
the source for killing homosexuals will try to ignore this 
inconvenient lay.
Well, yes, to find 2 or 3 independent eyewitnesses to an actual
act of homosexuality is quite a task.
And DEUTERONOMY 19:16-21 make it quite clear what the punishment
for bearing false witness is to be.

<p>
(GREG LAKE QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Confusion shall be my epitaph..." 
from ``Epitaph'' (with King Crimson, 1969)

<p>
(RUSSIA-BOOB): SO I LIED!!!!!!! It's Diplomacy. It's required...

<p>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): Who's Greg Lake?

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): I should mention that the two classical
music radio stations in Los Angeles seem to be doing well enough
in spite of occasional stabs at each other.
KKGO-FM, the commercial station, began to announce itself as 
``your classical music station without all the talk'', a snide
comment on KUSC-FM's programming.
This included the one hour every evening when KUSC simulcasted
the LEHRER NEWS HOUR.
Why rebroadcast something that is on TV?
<i>((Isn't it obvious?
To catch those commuters who want to hear it in their cars.
Radio is organized primarily to capture car listeners....
he writes before reading the next sentence...))</i>
The argument was that it was needed for those who might 
want to hear the newshour 6:30pm to 7:30pm but were driving
home in the LA freeway traffic.
Duh, like video recorders couldn't tape it for those who wanted it?
So KUSC reluctantly axed the newshour.
It now programs music all evening except for a half hour of news
starting at 7PM.
<i>((Hmmm, OK.))</i>
KUSC also had 4 hours of programs, 10AM-2PM, that featured lots of talk.
Interviews, comment, patter, all designed on the belief that you needed
lots of chatter to bring new listeners to classical music.
It didn't work and only annoyed the dedicated listeners, as well as giving
KKGO some excuses for snide comments. 
So that got axed.
<i>((The speed of changes, amazes.))</i>
And yet... there is still the matter of trying to expand the audience
for classical music.
How?
Dumbing down the product doesn't work, ``crossover'' stuff doesn't last,
talky talky shows fail.
Commercial KKGO just plugs away with nothing but classical music and
hopes for the best.
It has enough of a sophisticated audience to keep the advertisers happy.
Poor Listener Supported KUSC has cut back on the talk but still feels
the need for some programming other than straight classical music,
especially on weekends.
Fund drives are frequent.
<i>((Yup.))</i>
NOW, just to show that I can and do go slumming on occasion, I am happy
to announce the return of THE DOCTOR DEMENTO SHOW to the Los Angeles
radio scene after a silence lasting over one year.
By the time you read this, he will be broadcasting LIVE on KLSX-FM (97.1),
Sunday 8-10PM.
I hope it works out.
I do appreciate good novelty songs.
I also agree with the bumper sticker I once saw that read
``Rap is to music as etch-a-sketch is to Art.''

1) Note Randy Ellis' approaching address change.... gee, haven't
we seen one like that before??

<p>
2) The DIAS FAGER draw is proposed for Spring votes.
If you fail to vote, the draw is vetoed.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TRIESTE): Capitalizing on the power vacuum since Von Steuben's
departure, militant Marxist-Leninists seized power in the current
capital of Austria-Hungary.
A smiling Bolshevik identifying himself only as ``V. Lenin'', 
his face eerily lighted by the mound of burning banker's bodies
to his right, quipped ``there just might be a few changes around here.''
The remnants of the Austro-Hungarian army has reportedly pledged
support to the new regime.

<p>
(CZAR to HIMSELF): All that I deserved for getting conservative.

<p>
(TRIESTE to PARIS): Latest letter received... you will be hearing
from me in early May/late April.

<p>
(CZAR to FORMER BUTLER): To the contrary, when I noticed I was no longer
interested in communicating, that's when I stabbed everyone, so I would
have no allies.  Really, with whom do you suggest I try to gain
``prestige" by writing?  What would I say?  
Isn't being arrogant and taunting in the press enough?

<p>
(SKYWALKER - SHERWOOD): Well, I did not take two of yours but
I prevented you from winning by taking two SC's you had.
I challenge you to be a real man and take a SC in the north!
It is even at 17 apiece, but I feel the tide will switch in
the alliance's favor.
By the way, I never NMR.

<p>
(CZAR to FORMER BUTLER): By the way, you're fired.  Again.

<p>
(ELLIS to WORLD): I thought I'd get in one more COA before
this game ends.
Indeed, I expect to get in one more after this one.... it's 
good to be headed back to the mountains.

<p>
(SD to VB): Glad to hear you bought my product.  How did you like it?  
Did you try electronic filing (really my product)?

<p>
(ELLIS to BARNO): So how is it to be back in Endwell/Endicott??
I am, of course, headed back north.
I might even have convinced this pale, rather gothic brunette who
likes taking photographs of roadkills to go up there with me.
<i>((Lots of roadkills on the way, and I would think lots more
interesting ones and larger ones in the mountain climes.
Don't see no hoary marmots down there in the swamp.))</i>
Even if she returns to Virginia instead, we're having lots of fun
right now.

<p>
(SD to VOCAB BUILDER): It is well known that the term ``bitter end" 
came about in 18th century England to describe sodomy, as in 
``He prefers blokes and the bitter end."
Keep this in mind, opponents of Russia, when you vow how far you 
will fight.

<p>
(BOOB to SKYWALKER): You got that one straight now???

<p>
(JIM-BOB to BOOB): Boo, hiss, boo, hiss!!!
I'm with Harry in Fear and Whiskey!!!

1) Hank and Ed are

<p><br><p><br><i>Endgame and Other Assorted Comments</i>

<p>
<p>
<center>Endgame Statement for Austria, Friedrich Nietzsche 1995w</center><br>

<p>
This is where you will hear the long and sordid tale of an Austrian-ArchDuke
and how not to open as the Austrian player. This pathetic parable need not be
told beyond the opening plays of F-N, for the end occured in the beginning.

<p>
My opening play was simple in concept, simple in planning, and poor in
execution. Some time ago in a zine <i>Been There Done That</i> by one Tom Nash, 
I played my very first P-B-M game, where as Austria I did very well by gaining
allies in both Russia and Turkey. By the end of 1901 I was sitting pretty with
three builds and complete mastery over the Balkans. By promising to support
both Russia and Turkey into Rum neither would have supported the other there
and I could pick it up.  I have tried to duplicate that maneuver numerous
times since then. This attempt could not be called a success. 

<p>
I allied with Don as quick as I could. Don turned out to be very solid player
and we always got along well in our letters and in our phone calls. I thought
I had a real shot at getting a Lepanto out of him. He wanted to move to
Tyrolia in 01, as ``Italy can often sneak into Mun in 01 and gain an extra
build," he said. I worried about the stab when he mentioned it to me, but I
was focused of getting three in 01. I wanted Rum, and Don could do what he
liked just so long as it was not take any of my home centers. That is what I
was thinking at the time anyway. Don warned me again and again to move to Gal,
but I was so sure Ed would move due south, into the Ukr in order to get at the
Rum I was going to support him into. 

<p>
I wrote Ed many times in the opening seasons and every letter said nearly the
same thing. I hated the witches, hated playing them and playing against them,
and wanted our neighborhood witch to begin melting. Others have called Ed,
``the man to beat" or ``solid player," but I have to admit, I did not get that
vibe from his letters. Of course the other two were right, and I got Russian
army Gal for my lack of intuition. I really thought I had him moving to
Ukraine and The Black. I promised Ed that I would support him into Bul if he
left Gal alone and moved to the Black.  I am sure that here again, I was
focused on gaining Rum. It clouded my judgement. 

<p>
I never told Dave, Turkey, the truth. Not even one time. I told him that I
would be happy to support him into Rum if he would join my attack on Russia.
Dave was always more tacturn in his talks with me. I think he could sense I
was lying to him. It really didn't matter to the possible success of my first
year plan if Turkey was with me or not. As long as Russia was with me, I could
take Rum. Sure, Turkey could bounce me in Gre, but with units in Rum and Ser,
Bul and Gre would be mine in due course. While my focusing on the completion
of my plan did not hurt me as much in my talks with Dave, they could not have
helped. By lying to him so early I damaged the relationship for the rest of
the game. 

<p>
So, I think everything is set. Russia is with me. He will he get 0 builds from
his southern front, maybe only one up north, he will be attacking Turkey,
Italy is with me, and Turkey will be back to three by 02. My plan is set, the
hell with what Italy has to tell me about Gal. 

<p>
Spring results told me a much different story. Russia sat in Galacia,
threatening two home supply centers, and the R-T was obvious. That was the end
of my plan. It should have been the end of my blindness, but it was not.

<p>
Don and I now had to get down to the business of containing the R-T. His plan
to keep Russia at no builds in the first year and prevent Turkey from gaining
the Aeg in Fall 01 sounded like a good one. Italy would skip the build in
Tunis and keep Turkey out of the Aeg, I would give up Vienna so that Italy
would get a build in 1901, we would both gain one, and Russia would be stuck
with zero 01 builds. In fact, I think it is the primary reason for my long
slow decline in this game. 

<p>
I thought long and hard about bouncing Italy in Vienna. With that one move, I
would portect all of my centers from all possible units. I would gain two
builds and be safe for another season or two. I didn't make this move. I
thought that a strong Italian ally was better than a weak one,  Don promised
Vie back to me, I did not want to antagonize my only friend with a bounce, and
I thought it would send the message to Don that I was a faithful and loyal
ally. An ally so loyal and committed to the I-A that I would give up one of my
home ceters for the good of the alliance. So, Italy took Vienna and that was
the end of it. 

<p>
From that moment on the game was dominated by Don. Italy called the shots and
there was really nothing I could do about it. This unit Italian unit in my
home center threatened every move I make. It hung over me, a gallows shadow on
dungeon wall. Don's right when he says we had our differences. Each season we
both seemed to have our own ideas about where to attack and what to move. As
we had to work so closely, these differences always became bigger than they
probably actually were. Season after dragging season we attacked at the R-T.
When I thought I would have the chance to take back Vie, the Italian needed to
retreat back into it. Again, as the loyal ally, I let him in. 

<p>
Finally, I took Bulgaria. I thought we had cracked the line. We were making
progress in the north as well, slow as it was, but I think we could have done
it. Then Italy stabbed me the first time. He was in perfect position for it,
as he always had an army amongst mine. I never could get rid of that damn army
that took Vie back in 01. It cost me a unit, year after weary year, and kept
my options limited as to how I could move. Now, it was like a sickly green
dagger aimed at Austria's unarmored heart. 

<p>
Luckily, Don's strike was just as sickly. It was a silly stab. I had been
getting the feeling that something was up between Russia and Italy for a
couple of seasons, but what could I do? Italy called the shots. When Don
understood that the stab was not all it was cracked up to be, back we were,
happy little A-I again. Well, maybe not all that happy. I became even weaker
and was little more than a toadie to someone for the rest of the game. Don
wanted to include Dave in our little anti-Russian coalition. He even set up a
three way call one night between us. This was a mistake, and I knew it, and I
said it, and it was. Again, what was I going to do about it? Don was calling
the shots, now after his first stab than ever. For a few seasons at this
stage, I would only talk to Don to get my orders, and then to Jim to make the
orders Don gave me official. Sure enough, Dave went back to Ed a few seasons
later and all the A-I received for its troubles was wasted time that could
have gone to finishing Turkey off once and for all. 

<p>
A few seasons later, Don did it again. Attacked his poor, sad, loyal ally. It
was like beating a dog Don. Ed called and the next season and I became a his
toad. Just changing who was giving the orders really. At least I got to get
back at Don some at the end. 

<p>
I really did not appreciate being denied my survival by Ed. That was all I was
playing for there at the end. I was voting yes to every draw there was. Turns
out Don was the one voting no, and, in a way, getting in one last stab. 

<p>
I do thank Jim for an excellent job GMing, and all of the other players in the
game. I never had the chance to take with some of them but a letter or two.
Ed was the player to beat, I just didn't know it before it was to late. Dave
fought very well and never stopped going at the game with 100%.  

<p>
Lastly, I have no hard feelings to anyone, Don. I may have done the same thing
if I were you. In fact, I probably would have done it sooner. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br>
<center>FN French endgame statement (be still, your beating heart)</center><br>

<p>
When this game started, I had not yet recovered from some
brutal mistreatment by Eric Brosius' England in 1989Z, so I definitely
was in an anti-English state of mind.  I therefore allied with Hank's
Germany against John Schultz' England.  From Don Williams' Italy I 
asked for, and received a nonaggression pact.  I did not realize until
much later, how close Don had been to a 1902 attack on me.  My good
fortune that he did not, since I antagonized England by moving to
the Channel in Spring '01, and a GI 1902 attack would have crushed me.
	
The attack on England was slow going, due to determined and
valiant defense by John.  But it was clear that the FG would win 
eventually.  My next big diplomatic break was the acrimony between
Hank and Ed Rothenheber (Russia).  Hank had been making anti-Russian 
moves in the early game, but without really launching an all-out attack
on Ed.  So, I knew that once England was gone, I could count on a 
Russian alliance against Germany.  My other option was to attack Don,
but my fleets were in no position to do that, and any naval move
south would have given Don plenty of advance warning.  So I stabbed
Germany.  Of course, the turn of my stab, Don moved against me.  I 
had a long talk with Don, where he asked me to give him a center (Mar,
I think?), and I refused.  Eventually, Don and I agreed that it was in
both of our interests for us to reforge our nonaggression pact, which
we did.
	
In the midgame, while I made gradual but steady progress
against Hank, Ed and Don emerged as the dominant players in the east.
It was clear that the game would come down to FIR, and probably some
sort of two-on-one.  Again I had to chose my ally-Don or Ed.  In the
end, the same reasons that led me to chose Don over Hank led me to chose
Don over Ed; my units were simply much closer to Russian centers than
to Italian ones.  Furthermore, Ed clearly had a stronger position than
Don, and a slow French attack on Italy was likely to lead to a Russian
win (losing never did have much appeal for me).  So in fall 1906 I 
attacked Ed, but he was ready for me.  That turn Ed also stabbed Don, 
cheating him out of three (!) centers.  Meanwhile, to complete the
treacherous triangle, Don stabbed me, by moving a fleet to Wes.  
	
I had another long talk with Don, and he yet again had the
nerve to ask me to give him one of my centers.  This time, to his 
surprise, I agreed.  It was clear that he needed the center more than
me, and clearer still that unless we allied, Ed would win.  So Don
took Spain and that gave him the build he needed to keep the Russians 
out of Venice.  Meanwhile Ed, who is as adept tactically as he is
diplomatically, had allied with the remains of Germany and Austria, 
and was giving Don and me a run for our money. I believe that the game
came down to a single German order, when Hank retreated an army otb
rather than to Sil.  This allowed a French army into Sil.  That army
ended up in Galicia (I went there at Don's suggestion), and single-
handedly crushed the entire Russian war effort by repeated judicious
cuts of Russian support in Austria.  
	
Even before it became clear that FI was winning against R,
Ed made a very strong effort to break up the FI.  But Don and I both
feared a Russian comeback, and stayed allied.  Contrary to the belief
of the other commentators of this game, I feel that I never had a
reasonable opportunity to stab Don for the win, and the game ended
in a FI draw before such an opportunity developed.  I don't know if
I would have taken such an opportunity, anyway, since I tend to be
a softie towards my ally in the endgame.

<p>
So, thanks to Don and Hank for being great allies, to everyone else
(especially Ed) for playing well, and to Jim , GM extraordinaire :-)

<i>((And that was that.
I hope everyone/anyone enjoyed the Friedrich Nietzsche quotes.
I noticed no one commented on their pivotal role in the endgame
statements :-(
Well, I enjoyed writing them in any case.
It was a great game to GM and I did follow the game very closely
behind the scenes, even though there was very little other press
for the rest of you to follow.
I hope these endgame statements gave a sense for the rich environment
under which it was played.

<p>
1) The GT, FG, FGT, and the DIAS FGAT all are rejected.
All are reproposed, please vote with your Summer orders.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): I know that this may sound silly to you, but 
can I get you to kill, or allow me to kill, Austria?
The French player has made it clear that he will hold you in the
MED while I eat him.
So I guess you will have to vote for a draw sooner or later, or
risk a loss?
We'll have to see.
<i>((We will, won't we!!!
Heh, heh, heh....))</i>
Who will blink first, you or France?
My bet is you, I've played with Harold before and I believe that he
will do exactly what he says.
Time will tell?

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): I can't get Turkey to do, or vote, for anything.
(That goes for the Austrian too, he came around at the end, but it was
after he couldn't help us.)  I suspect that the Turk is keeping the
Austrian alive so no one will know who is voting against the draws.
I know what you are voting for and I vote for the same things, except
I decided to quit voting for the Austrian to take part in any of the 
draws.
He did not earn it.
If he turns around and does something to earn it, he can have a part.
I can't remember if you have said in your press twice or thrice
that you were not going to try to move into the MED.
I will try to slowly move West and eat your centers, so that you
can keep the Turk from getting them.
If I do this he will get nervous and vote for the draw, giving you what
you want, an end to the game; and me what I want, a three player draw.
So if you'll hold the Turkish fleet in the MED, I think that I can
force this issue.
Let me take the English Centers first.
Let me know if you like this plan, it's the best that I can come up
with, without Austrian help.
And, he's been no help so far.

<p>
1) The game continues.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
 
(LIL' RED RIDING HOOD to BIG BAD WOLF): Keep your big, hairy mitts off my
basket of goodies, Herr Wolf.

<p>
(STATE FARM INSURANCE COMPANY to GERMANY): If you have a burning
house to report, you have to fill out these forms in quadruplicate.  Any
fighting you do therein is your own business, but injuries suffered as a
result of voluntarily engaging in fisticuffs are not covered under your
health insurance policy.

<p>
(A GUESS FROM STEVIE):  James didn't NBR this turn, did he?

<p>
(BOOB to STEVIE): But he did NPR!

<p>
(SCHULTZ to JAMES): Well... okey.... I'm not so much rooting for 
Germany as rooting for the continued drama.
Plus... I'd love to survive this game without having had to toady to
anyone in order to do it.
I've much enjoyed my role as barb here.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD):  Any bets on whether McGwire catches Maris
this year?  Or whether Gwynn hits .400?  (Notice that nobody's talking
about breaking any pitching records right now.)
<i>((I'd give about even money on SOMEONE catching Maris, it might
be McGuire and it might be someone else.
I do NOT think Gwynn or anyone else will hit .400 this year, although
someone probably will flirt with it.
Gwynn has gotten off to an earthbound start so far, though his
team has been phenomenal.))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): By the time the next deadline rolls around,
my wife will have returned home, after five weeks on the road.  (Sigh.) 
Then she's home for two months before leaving for six weeks to go
teach up in Schroon Lake again.  This is sort of like being a Navy spouse,
although I can at least go visit.
<i>((Yeah, I understand.))</i>
