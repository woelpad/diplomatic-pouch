<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />The Kendo Nagasaki game keeps going, I like running them and
I also like playing in them... mostly.  If you want to join, you need to do so
now as they are honing in on the solution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, I did get complaints about the lateness of this issue, I'm turning this one around
ASAP to see if I can fix that.  I almost got it done last weekend, then had a
horrendously busy week at work.  For the two Diplomacy games, I just need the 
adjustments, so I didn't think it would be that much of a problem.
I do have orders again from everyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i> in
<i>NSWG</i> #16, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  
Since Terry's passing, we lose our thirty year fervent hope that someday <i>NSWG</i>
would have been resurrected and I could go back and swear my fealty to the Toadfather.
The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I'm having trouble with the upload interfaces, part of the 
diplom.org site move consequences.  I'll get it fixed as soon as I can.
I need to stay within the security of the site (which is very important!!!!)
while getting access to change the web site's index and files for the szine.
It shouldn't be that hard, but my first attempt didn't work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved yet again.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are still in charge. 
There were a few glitches and broken links, but things should be fixed now, if you
have problems, let us know!
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
The address is still:
http://diplom.org/.
I had a glitch in the webpage update process, but that should be fixed for this issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the current list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
I'm trying to add some of the newer subscribers who aren't there.  
If you have questions or problems, PLEASE ask.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, I see that does help.
Please let me know about other issues, but it puts priority on getting link up again.
Apologies for last issue's confusions.

Last time I missed the other Baseball season predictions.... here they are...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Monday, March 28, 2016 3:26 PM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's that time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just as an aside, this is the 50th year that I've consciously cheered for the 
Cubs as my favorite team.  
This may or may not color what I write below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  Looks a lot stronger than the past few years.  
I'm actually picking 3 teams to make the playoffs out of here.  
In honor of the David Ortiz 
farewell tour brought to you by Advanced Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Toronto, 
Boston (WC1),
New York (WC2), Tampa Bay, Baltimore.  Toronto gets the #2 seed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Looking forward to the Hanley Ramirez plays 1st base experiment. 
Can he collect another Lead Glove for his defensive brilliance? 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What do I know about the non-Red Sox teams in this division? 
Very little, except that the Yankees picked up the guy with the fastest 
fastball in the bigs, who bizarrely is named after some kind of antacid, 
at least in an anagrammattical fashion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: For those of you wondering if the Adam LaRoche saga looked as 
silly in Chicagoland as it did elsewhere, the answer is a resounding, "yes".  
It also probably took the White Sox from a potential division contender to one 
with more clubhouse animosity than the late '70s Yankees.  
Detroit, Kansas City, Cleveland, White Sox, Minnesota.  
The bottom 3 win 74, 72 and 71 games respectively.  Detroit gets the #3 seed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I saw LaRoche hit a homer for the Nats, live, in the very recent past. Looked
good that day. But I have to wonder what kind of life you have where you can 
walk away from a multi-million dollar salary because your boss doesn't let you 
treat every single day as "Bring Your Kid to Work Day".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That any other player would be on LaRoche's side is weird to me. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: I know what you're thinking here: "Goz has lost his mind!"  
I know you're thinking that because you've been thinking it for nearly 20 years.  
Houston, Texas, Seattle, California, Oakland.  
The Astros get the top seed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Still don't like seeing the Astros in the AL.  
Can't we trade them for the Brewers and make everything right again?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  The second WC in the NL is the toughest pick, but I'm going to say 
it doesn't come from this division.  New York, Washington, Atlanta, Miami, 
Philadelphia.  
The Phillies lose 4 managers during the season, 3 of which fight extradition 
when the team tries to bring them back.  The Mets get the #2 seed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wondering if Dusty can fix the Nats, who underperformed tremendously last year.
Mets have the pitching, but then again, so do the Nats, at least in theory.
In Atlanta they watch re-broadcasts of the glory days of Maddux, Glavine, and 
Smoltz. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Ok, brace yourselves...  Chicago, Pittsburgh (WC2), St. Louis, 
Milwaukee, Cincinnati. 
The whole division actually loses ground to the rest of the league, and the Cubs get the #3 seed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cubs should be good.  But wasn't that true last year?  
Have to say I'm enjoying seeing the band get back together in the city that 
practically gave birth to the phrase.  Now if only they can get Jake and Elwood 
to play with Lester and Lackey, a World Series trip is a guarantee. 
Cardinals win a lot of games just out of habit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: Jim-Bob will point out that it's an even-numbered year.  
Despite that...  San Francisco, Los Angeles (WC1), Arizona, San Diego, Colorado.  
It looks like the Dodgers start out hurting at pitcher, but will rally 
late in the year.  The Giants get the #1 seed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So despite it being an even-numbered year...oh never mind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wild Card: Yankees beat the Red Sox when the ghost of Bucky Freakin' Dent 
hits a home run late.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Many reasons this won't happen, probably the most important of which is that 
Bucky Dent isn't dead yet.  Should he die sometime this summer, 
I'll sic the female ghost-busters after his spirit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Anyone who thinks the female ghostbusters movie will be worth watching
needs to have serious head examination...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Astros over Yankees in 4. Blue Jays over Tigers in 3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Could these things be true? 
You're predicting an ALCS between the Astros and Jays?  (shudder)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And wait - what happened to the Royals?  
Aside from having one of their relievers get Tommy John surgery.  He must be coming back.  
I say this because Yahoo auto-drafted him for my fantasy team.  (Moral of the story: don't do autodraft.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  With the series tied at 2-2 a large brawl ensues after 2 Blue Jay batters in a row flip their 
bats while hitting long fly outs, and the Blue Jays are never the same.  Astros win 4-2.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Few things bother me more than "old school" players inventing a new rule 
about bat flips and acting like they're defending some principle other than 
their own thin skin.  Reggie Jackson never had a problem gloating over his HRs.  
Nobody ever said he was bad for the game.  OK, that part's not true, but 
he was still the best clutch power hitter of the era.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wild Card: Dodgers beat the Pirates.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS: Cubs exorcise last year's inability to hit the Mets pitching, and win 3-1.  
Dodgers treat the Giants poorly, and beat them 3-0.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Dodgers refuse to be exorcised and beat the Cubs 4-1. Ouch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series:  Despite most of the Eastern media boycotting it, the Astros win
the World Series in 7.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BUT WAIT!!!  THERE'S MORE!!! I will now predict what you 3 are going to 
predict.  
That way you guys may get off your lazy asses early last year and start this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob will predict that the Giants beat the Red Sox in the World Series.  
Ok, that's not hard, that's been his prediction since 1919.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Wrongo, I predicted the Astros too, what is looking like a stupendously
bad prediction, and I predicted the Cubs would get farther than you, losing to
the Astros in the World Series.  You can go look it up two issues ago...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dave will want to pick the Red Sox to win the World Series, 
but won't out of fear of jinxing them.  However, he *will* predict the Cubs to 
lose the World Series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick will pick a Red Sox - Cubs World Series just because he's intrigued by The
Apocalypse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i><b>Rick Desper:</b> Hmm...this part checks out.</i>

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ANONYMOUS PRESS): If you’re going to be blown, you might as well take as many infidels as you can with you. 
So with a whoosh and a roar, there’s a sudden explosion in the back of the pack, 
and several bodies come hurtling forwards...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Some people grabbed points (and the last point in this sprint will go to the 
rider sitting on line 40), while others hung back a bit, and the pack did spread out
a bit.  
Let's see what happens now...

<br /><br /> <b>HINT to the Person with the Closest Geographic Guess:</b> I think it is time to say two things, only two of you avoided getting 
further away from me again this time, and while Germany is a wonderful country, it is NOT the country I'm in.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
I had almost all of this issue done a week earlier, I just needed to finish a few things and go grab the Baseball commentaries
that I had forgotten to include.
Note the dates on them as a record of when they actually were written.
I think I will say a bit on the state of the Baseball season so far.
I mostly listen on the radio, so it really hasn't bothered me; however, the rules on challenges and how long they take still needs
more work if it isn't going to drive more fans away than it keeps.
Goz thought that Hanley Ramirez would be awful at First Base for the Red Sox; however, it was obvious to me that this switch was 
brilliant.  Hanley simply got bored in Left Field, he actually stays in the game at First, and plays it pretty well.  So far.
No guarantee he doesn't get bored later and things get bad, but I don't think they will.
David Ortiz is on a pace to break the record for doubles in a season, has hit a triple (!!) and is on pace to hit more than 40 HRs again.
Will he really retire after that?
And would people stop (REALLY STOP) doing anything except get excited about it?
The unstated issue, which I'm not going to state, also remains a mess in sports.
Half the athletes probably should be banned from the Olympics in Rio, and it may save their health...
Goz's Cubs are just smokin' hot and my prediction they will get to the World Series looks better and better as you look around
the National League. 
What will Goz and all those Cubs fans do???
Otherwise, it is only in the Diplomacyverse that sanity prevails, the rest of the world just seems nuts and people seem to have no
idea how negotiations work, and what they do and DO NOT do for you.
Only we understand this.
Mark Fassio continues to get sicker and needs more and more of your prayers and good wishes.  I will try to say more about that next
time.
My own chemotherapy remains perched on the end point, with two more treatments scheduled that right now are scheduled to be the end.
These last rounds have been tough and apologies on how it has affected the szine.
My wife went through cancer before me, and now me going through it makes me realize more and more that the world of cancer treatment
is a world almost unto itself.  I didn't understand so much, so much, when Charlotte was going through it, that I now understand so well.
It is just such an awful disease, even though we've made so much progress.
But still, it makes me REALLY, REALLY want to go to World DipCon this year, except that it is being held on the same weekend
as my major academic professional conference, where I'm on all sorts of committees and doing all sorts of things.
The plan to fly out JUST for the Thursday night festivities was nixed by logic, but really, if you can go, you REALLY should.
As I feel better I'm going to turn back into a Diplomacy con traveler.  
I really want to go back for more tournaments in Europe.
David Norman and I had dinner together this past week as he was on his way to DixieCon.
Again, very sorry that I couldn't go to that, and the results are just coming in as I finalize this.
I think Emily Pollock (who recall I am predicting is setting up for a great career in the Tournament world) tied for
Best England with Randy Lawrence-Hurt and finished third, while Randy finished fifth.</b>
