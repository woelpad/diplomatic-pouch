<br /><br />We are again seriously late for a whole host of reasons.
I won't bore you with all of them, but the most important reasons are
the sad one of having to report the passing of Phil Reynolds after his
very, very long illness, and the movement of the whole diplom.org site
by Millis Miller from David Kovar.
The operation of the web site is still not up the way it eventually
will be, but ALL the items are actually there, you just have to find
them.
The key to finding them is to note that you must use the www.diplom.org
designation for the site instead of the diplom.org that we had
been using.
I've changes all the references in this issue of the szine, but
not any of the other ones.
If you're a bit resourceful, you'll be able to find everything,
and eventually it will all be updated so it will all work as before.
We need to first thank David Kovar for 15 years of assistance to all of
us in keeping this site going.
And then we need to thank Millis Miller for picking it up and keeping 
it going.
As many of you discovered, the site was down for a little over a week
and I didn't want to release the szine in the middle of it.
Also, I needed to get standbys and begin to set up for taking
over two of Phil Reynolds' games - both of the regular Diplomacy games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, here is the official obituary from one of the local newspapers (these things
are very easy to find these days on the Internet):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Philip Paul Reynolds, 39, Sarasota, died March 13, 2005.
He was born Oct. 16, 1965, in Gibson City, Ill., and came to Sarasota 
38 years ago from there. He was managing editor for Health Management 
Technology with Nelson Publishing Co. and a publisher of Dippity Doo-Dah 
Magazine. He graduated from Pine View High School and was a member 
of the Sierra Club.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Survivors include his mother, Carole C. of Sarasota; and his father and 
stepmother, Rollie and Judie of Venice.  A service will be later. 
Toale Brothers Funeral Home, Colonial Chapel, is in charge.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Memorial donations may be made to the Philip P. Reynolds Fund, 
c/o Century Bank, 3600 Tuttle Ave., Sarasota, FL 34239. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((<b>Dippity Doo-Dah</b> was of course one earlier incarnation for
Phil of what you knew finally as <b>ishkibibble</b>.
In particular, given his long illness, I think the fund is important
to his mother and I intend to send something along.
The illnesses Phil had were taxing on his mother, both financially 
and emotionally.  Tom Howell has more about that in his latest
<b>Off the Shelf</b>.
In any case, Phil was a good hobby friend and a fellow publisher.
Between Tom and myself, I think we're going to try to restart Phil's
games, so contact one or both of us if you were in one of Phil's
games and either can or can't keep playing.
I also asked for other notes and commentary and here is what I received.
There is more on the two games either I or Harold Reynolds - in his
subszine - will be restarting.))</i>

Hi all,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have some bad news for those not in the loop (or on the <i>TAP</i> mailing 
list). Phil passed away last Sunday, the 13th.  Read below for what 
might happen with the <i>ishkibibble</i> games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just wrote a letter to Jim Dapkus.  Is anyone in a game with Cary 
Nichols in a different szine?  Perhaps you could let him know as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rest in peace, Phil.  He was my introduction to the postal Diplomacy 
world and opened my eyes to some great films in the short time I was an 
<i>ishkibibble</i> player.

<br /><br /><b>Paul Risner (Tue, 22 Mar 2005 00:17:44 EST)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hello All:
I read the sad news today about Brer' Phil and thought I might write a few  
lines. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Like some of you, but not most of you I think, I knew Phil and gamed many  
weekends at his house when I lived in Sarasota. Phil had a regular gaming 
group that met on most Sunday afternoons to play some multi-player game or 
another, but mostly to sit and talk about life, the universe and everything.  When 
Phil first became ill, he came to the hospital where I worked. He never asked 
for favors, but I made sure they took good care of him. After I moved away, 
we kept in contact through the games and a few times saw each other at  
conventions.
I last saw Phil 3 years ago, when he passed through Memphis on his way back  
from a wild west kayaking trip...and he talked my ear off about more trips he  
had planned for later years...never once allowing that fate, time and health  
might conspire to prevent those trips. It did not matter: I saw in his eyes 
that he had already taken them, in his mind, and his descriptions of the 
sights and  experiences only awaited the confirmation of being there.
I lost many games and football pools to Phil (was anyone ever so good or so 
lucky at so many games?!) over the years and endured his endless sarcastic  
remarks about my lack of skill, but never tired of his company. 
I learned how to play Dip, and Civ and Mach from Phil...after receiving so  
many drubbings, I HAD to learn how to play them better...ha-ha! 
I appreciated his knowledge of football, particularly the few teams he  
really liked, and especially the Vikings! 
I liked his politics, though he was even to the left of me! 
I liked his resolve to live with this illness with good humor, despite what  
it did to him, and his concern for others, because he felt they worried too 
much  about him.
His take on religion, or lack of it, did not concern me and I was not  
worried for his salvation. I think he found what heaven he expected on this earth, 
and sought no other.
He was honest.
I could go on...I know Phil liked many things, but I know he loved two...his 
fat cat who, when his health looked to be failing a few years ago, he worried
would need a home; and his Mother, whom I met, and who loved him without  
limits. For her, I am sad tonight and thankful that she had him for the time 
she did, and that she shared him with us. He was a good son to her, and treated 
her with great respect.
So, to Brer Phil, my friend, I say "So long old pal..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd enjoy hearing more from all of you...and would be happy to complete any  
of Phil's games I was in, although I can't recall which ones they were. It  is 
a fitting tribute to Phil that he had so many friends, looking at the  
addresses above, and that games brought us all together. Surely a man can live in 
this world for a longer time and leave far less behind as a legacy.

<br /><br /><b>Marc Ellinger (Wed, 23 Mar 2005 21:56:50 EST)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I too am at a loss for words at the passing of Phil.  Unlike others, I didn't 
know Phil for a long time, but he had a way of making you feel like you knew 
him forever.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I bumped into Phil in a PBEM Dip game several years ago.  We hit it off and 
he invited me into the world of Zine Diplomacy.  I enjoyed his games (both 
diplomacy and other deeper thinking games) and his commentary on movies and life 
(often both at the same time.)  He and I would email to each other, both having 
very different views on many issues, but never finding fault with each other 
on a personal level.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am 38 and when I see a contemporary pass on at such a young age, it hits a 
little harder than most would expect.  I knew Phil was ill but I had no idea 
of the extent of his illness.  I am still stunned at Karl's email.  It's 
actually taken me a few days to compose myself to write this note (and not much of 
one at that) because just thinking about losing Phil is to address my own 
mortality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll never forget the humor and good nature of Phil.  He evidenced it in 
private and in public (through <i>Ishkibibble</i>) and he will be missed.  I wish there 
was something profoundly deep that I could conclude with but I cannot put 
anything fitting in writing, so I'll say something simple:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My grandmother always said, "never say goodbye, just say until we see each 
other again."  Phil, you touched more people than you'll ever know.  I, for one, 
will miss you, until we see each other again.

The postal sub price is still

Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count.

Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list

<b>THE SEARCH FOR DEREK NELSON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm going to continue putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, 
working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
Derek Nelson is the person who won the first postal game in
<i>Graustark</i>.
He's been missing for at least 25 years, I know in the records I can
find that he attended the 1976 DipCon in Baltimore.
I think it will be fun if we can find these Golden Agers.
So, let's really find Derek, it's worth fifty bucks!!!
You have until issue #295 at the fifty buck price.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Map Collection, ERC Library, University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
That's a relatively new address adjustment.

They ARE going to make it and release it this fall, but there are a 
number of concerns and opportunities that this is going to create.
If anyone is interested, some of us have been in some informal contact
with the game designers, but I really don't have the time to fully
engage them.
I think the key note to take away is that they're surely going to design
a "simplified starter" version of the game that plays faster and more
exciting.
This is likely in some ways not to look like Diplomacy in any fashion
that people familiar with variants would state.
But they are committed to the basic design feature that you can make
promises that you can't be held to keep.
I don't want to be too negative or too positive about this development,
but it will be something that "changes the environment".
More on this for sure as I hear more.

Jim-Bob,
The calendar says it's baseball season again, and the weather is finally 
agreeing, so I've come back out from under my rock to make the usual 
rants about "inequity" and "evil empires".  I only do this because I 
know it makes your year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((It really does, thanks for good timing.  I love this, especially when
the Red Sox are defending champs.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's been interesting to hear all the preseason discussions amongst the 
supposed "learned".  As best as I can tell, if you follow all the 
national writers the playoff teams will be the Orioles, Tigers, 
Mariners, Twins, Phillies, Cubs, Giants and Marlins.  I think they do 
things like that just to see if we're paying attention.  Here's my take 
on the whole thing...
<i>((Uh, duh....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Dodgers, Giants, Padres, Diamondbacks &amp; Rockies.  Arizona 
might make it to 3rd, but I think San Diego holds that.  Barry is the 
question for the division.  If he's around, and the withdrawal from 
steroids doesn't take too much of a toll, then the Giants could make it 
interesting.  But I think the Dodgers hold on in a slightly weak 
division, even without Gagne for a while.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I say Giants, Padres, Dodgers, Diamondbacks, Rockies.  You forget how
much better the Giants supporting cast is, even without Barry for
awhile.  And I think he'll be back in May.  Let me choose a "sleeper"
pick in each division, since otherwise these are going to be
real boring..... Padres, they can make a run, much more likely
than the Dodgers.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Cardinals, Astros, Cubs, Reds, Brewers, Pirates.  St. Louis 
pitching can't possibly be as good this year as they were last year, but 
Houston and Chicago are both worse, so the Cardinals hold on to the 
division, even if Pettite retruns to form.  I'm starting to think that 
being a Cubs' pitcher can be hazardous to your health.  I had to stop 
taking Dusty's phone calls during Spring Training, as I didn't want to 
get hurt.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Here you are just right.  I agree entirely, dangerous but true.
Sleeper is the Reds, I have this funny feeling that Ken Griffey,
Jr. is going to surprise everyone and be an MVP candidate this year.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Braves, Mets (WC), Marlins, Phillies, Nationals.  When a team 
wins a division 13 straight times, it's more than a coincidence.  The 
change of manager in Philadelphia will be like shifting without a 
clutch, so I don't look for them to be any better this year.  The Mets 
will likely get enough acquisitions to have a decent team at the end of 
the year, and a good foundation for '06.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((You know I GOTTA know the Braves will win and THEN they will blow it
out in the playoffs..... see below too.  I think you WAY overestimate
the Mets, they will finish fourth and the Marlins will win the
Wild Card: Braves, Marlins (WC), Phillies, Mets, Nationals.
Sleeper is the Phillies.  You know, with that team, and without
Larry Bowa torturing them, they COULD just win the division.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  Angles, Mariners, Rangers, A's.  The Rangers might make second 
here.  The Angles, wherever they are, don't get the publicity that the 
other two evil empires get, but they should start to get lumped into 
that category.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Well, you're right, the Anaheim Angels (I'm refusing to use the
new name) will finish first, but you have the rest backwards.
The A's will surprise with the new Ownership, including Billy
Beane on the ownership team and so they are my sleeper.  They
may even spend a bit of money.  Angels, A's, Rangers, Mariners.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  Indians, White Sox, Twins, Tigers, Royals.  Eventually the 
Twins will stay within the realm of statistics and have enough injuries 
to not field a major-league team for the whole season, and Cleveland's 
pitching will carry them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think the Indians are the sleeper here and I commend you for picking
them.  But I think it will be the boring Twins, Indians, White Soz,
Tigers, Royals.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  Evil Empire #1, Evil Empire #2 (WC), Orioles, Blue Jays, Devil 
Rays.  If Boston is going to open with David Wells, who still looks like 
he ought to have a keg behind him when he pitches, they won't catch New 
York for the division.  Nonetheless, the dearth of talent elsewhere will 
likely allow them in as a Wild Card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think the Yankees with THIS team will crash and burn.  But will George
let them crash and burn?? Not without a fight.  Guaranteed that at least
five major league players will be on their team by the end of the year
not there now.  Start with the bullpen, CF, 2nd, and 1st as likely
crash and burn positions.  But, they may still win the division.
I will pick the Red Sox unless the Yankees get those five players.
Orioles, Blue Jays, and Devil Rays (gosh, how come the luckless
Devil Rays get the first positive steroid test suspension, there
oughta be a law!!).  The Red Sox 1 and 2 starters (Wade Miller
and Curt Schilling) will be in there before you know it.
The Blue Jays are the sleeper, you heard it here first......))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Playoffs:  Cards over Mets, Braves over Dodgers, Braves over Cards.
AL Playoffs:  Evil Empire #1 over Twins, Angels over Evil Empire #2.  
Evil Empire #1 over Angels.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series:  Evil Empire #1 over Braves.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think that this is the "standard" answer for how the playoffs will
turn out, and they are DEAD wrong.  The right answer is those damned
Marlins in the World Series again.  Gosh if they won't just play like
an expansion team!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, since Boston isn't due again until 2090, who are you picking this year?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And, yes, Boston again to win it for two in a row.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Thanks, Goz, all that is unedited from start of the season,
now here are some additional comments two weeks in.
The Orioles have no pitching, so they are a classic April team
and are playing like one, the Evil Empire #1, as you quaintly put it,
are doing just what I expected of them.
They won't play this badly all season, but if they want to win the division,
those positions I noted are good places to think about replacing people.
Tom Gordon, in particular, looks cooked.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The Red Sox are playing everything precisely how I expected, I won't
use your name for them.
Notice how the Steroids issue has faded completely into the background,
as they're now like every other sport, there is a system and there are
people using things and not using things.
And everyone plays by the rules of the game, which include the opportunity
to try to enhance one's performance against the check and balance of
the league testing policy.
And one can attempt to circumvent those rules, frequently succeeding.
Of course, the more money you have and the better you are, the better
the chances of successfully circumventing the rules.
You have to be realistic about the performance enhancement problem
and realize that it all is an issue of degrees.
You can't just make all performance enhancement illegal and make it stick.
You just can't.
I do support the idea of putting together a REAL performance drug testing
program in MLB, but you have to realize that they didn't have it before
because of complicity with the players.
You know, I also was a huge Gaylord Perry fan.... and he got into the
Hall of Fame, and I say deservedly.
To me, the REAL ethical issues come about when you put down the
performance of another player, we can wish that things were clearer
on the other end, but they aren't.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I remain a fan of Barry Bonds through all of that.
You have to remember how LONG I've been following Barry and my take on 
where his personality comes from.
My first awareness of BARRY Bonds was in 1970 when Bobby was with the Giants,
or somewhere around that time.
I first started following Bobby Bonds in the Spring of 1968, when I was ten
years old and DIVING into baseball, I started following Triple A games in
the Sporting News.  
I quickly became attached to this phenom Bobby Bonds, who hit close to .400
before being called up to the Giants in the middle of their traditional
"June Swoon".
And Bobby's career was followed VERY closely by the young Barry,
who also got his tiny amount of publicity to those following Bobby closely.
And Bobby basically got screwed over in ways that Barry would later
do almost ANYTHING to avoid.
Bobby Bonds was the nicest guy you could ever imagine, and the way that
then Giants owner Horace Stoneham tossed him out of town to.... I can't
say it, for.... the useless Bobby Murcer was a crime against baseball.
But I still rooted for him in his great 1975 season with the Evil Empire,
much as I still hated them, even then.
I wasn't a Red Sox fan then, I was a Giants and a Royals fan.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I was a Royals fan from THEIR beginning and similarly watched guys like
George Brett come from the minors (in I think 1971 he was a TERRIBLE 
third baseman in the California League) and become a good nemesis for
those hated Yankees.  
I didn't start becoming a Red Sox fan until after Bucky Dent and when
I became attached to a guy named Dave Stapleton when HE was in the 
minors.
I always start liking baseball players when they're in the minors,
before they make it.
And I've rooted for many, many guys over the years who became nothing,
more or less.
But I've rooted for them just the same.
Dave Stapleton is most famous, of course, for NOT being put in the
game to close out the 1986 World Series, as he was Buckner's defensive
replacement....
but, once these guys become the money machines, you're right, Goz.
They lose something.
But they still CAME from something else.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And I'll always be a baseball fan, and I'll always root for guys that
no one else has ever heard of.... 'cause it's fun.
But back to Barry.
His dad was the ultimate free swinger, and because people told him he had
to try to hit home runs, he really TRIED to do it.
Even though it ruined his average and gave him absurdly high strikeout totals.
I think if you asked Barry deep down, he's more proud of his patience at 
the plate and PROVING that home runs can still be hit, without free swinging.
This is both competition AND an homage to his dad, who lifetime hit only about
.270.
It's still all the Evil Empire's fault.
Really....))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Games in <i>TAP</i> generally are names after songs by the band, the
Mekons, and this game will not be an exception.
I thought it would be fun to name this one "Spirals of Paranoia", I've
meant to use that one as a game name for some time.
"Spirals of Paranoia" is a song on the country punk record 
<i>Retreat from Memphis</i>.
This song has a spiraling structure that builds up tension as you
might expect.
I was going to choose the next song on the record, "Missing You All",
which is about the most depressing, lonely, isolated Delta Blues
song I've ever heard.... brilliant.
But we'll go with "Spirals of Paranoia".
Not to say I'm trying to create anything, but this IS Diplomacy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Thanks to Boardman Number Custodian, Tom Howell, we have 
the first Boardman Number of 2005, 2005A.  
Thanks for using it in correspondence with each other and with me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Obviously, the big news which you all heard was that Steve
Robinson had to resign before submitting the first moves.
And note we have a new player.  
I have orders on file from all the rest of you, let me know if
you want to change them and I hope you'll engage the new player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-ITALY): Do you feel like you're between two pitbulls?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CONSTANTINOPLE (APR 1, 1901)):  Sultan Hatas I reposed on his 
divan, surrounded by his harem, "Tis lamentable, these French `agents 
provocateurs' who are complaining about us in Syria. We invite them here 
to drink `kaffa' and to partake of the `hookah', then we may see what 
manner of character are these infidels."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-TERRY/BERNIE): Great press.  I'm humbled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF PSYCHIC MIND WASHING AND MENTAL DETERGENT

Sandwiches rather than marching east, southeast or due south.  Add some

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Back on track, sorry for the delay!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to BOARD): I'm off to Italy - the REAL Italy - on the trip of a lifetime
to see an old flame from 30 years ago.
Wish us luck.
And be gentle with my dots until I get back!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to DON): I hope you had the trip of a lifetime and that they let you
star in the movie they make of your life and this trip.
In the romantic comedy genre, Will Smith's latest "Hitch" isn't half bad, but
nowhere near as good as your story COULD be.
We await the outcome....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ROME to PARIS): That goes double for you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-JEFF): Only when we play them. I must say though having said that: YOU 
ARE SOOOOO RIGHT!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WEARY HOFBRAUHAUS PATRONS-KIEL): Far too much fun for any unit to stay in
Munich for any length of time.  Did anyone else try to get in?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to HOFBRAUHAUS): Nah, and you passed up a perfectly unnecessary support
to Burgundy.
No one could figure out WHO was there, or wanted to be there!
Now, here's what the Russian has to say....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-ENGLAND, AUSTRIA, AND TURKEY): I am quite disappointed. Couldn't you 
all have waited till I wiped out France first?  Nothing better than stabbing 
your teacher or beating your teacher of a game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to SEAN): So let me get this straight; you are at war with Japan -
Colonial England - Colonial Turkey - England - Germany - Turkey and 
Austria?
Wow!
I don't think even I could write a Star Trek episode to cover that one.
Enjoy the moment, as always China and Russia suck!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): Colonial Diplomacy as a whole generally sucks.... and
there is about to be dearth of new Star Trek episodes that you're going 
to need to try to fill, as Enterprise (which also generally sucks) is 
going off the air.
I saw one episode the other night where they did a bunch of things and had
a subspace time warping virus cause another bunch of trouble.
And of course everyone died, but when the blew up the ship the time warping
virus died and they were all back where they started.
It really was amazingly lame and predictable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-JEFF): There weren't too many countries who didn't attack Germany,
so who can blame Don for tagging in?  I felt like the French Queen in 
History of the World Part I.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PS JEFF to SEAN): What the heck, since you are already fighting Japan, why don't
you head a little further east (or would that be west?) and attack Pearl Harbor
and bring the US into this???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY): Well, your portion of the Vodka is in Denmark or to those 
that take it..... Sorry you'll <i>(sic)</i> but Austria and Turkey cut my production and 
destroyed my roads to ship what all I had around areas they now control =(

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-SEAN): The plan was ok, but it helps if your target falls for it.  I
will quibble with the subsequent execution...why did I have to become part of the
"complete disaster"?  I had enough problems.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG "NOT GOOD"): We are heading into our seventh month since
we were transformed into Ferengi in the perpendicular universe.
We are being attacked by the Federation (this universe), the Romulans,
and Intelligent Tribbles.
The starship Bad Deal has been destroyed.
We thought we could re-fit another starship, but it turned out we did not have the
resources.
We never should have attacked the Federation (big mistake!).
On the other hand, the Breen are in prime shape to attack the Tribbles.
They'd be crazy not to.
Commander Worf is down to one troop transport and one starbase that he can't
defend.
The only question is does the rest of the Universe wipe us out, then the Tribbles,
or vice versa.
Maybe I can petition the Federation for membership.
Not likely since we started the war.
All I can do it try.
Kirk out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): Who is John Boardman?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFFY POO): Who is John Boardman??
He is the inventor of this little postal hobby and his szine is still going as he's
produced 763 issues.  I'm not even half way to catching up to him and at my current
rate I'd need over thirty years to catch up to him!!!
That's who he is.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) There also is a proposal for a concession to Germany.
Please vote on this, if both proposals pass, the concession
dominates.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Then we have the sad situation of replacing Phil Reynolds.
I'm using his last file orders this season, I hope that Vern
Parker will be willing to standby as the replacement.
If you want extra time to absorb this game, let me know.
The game history has been pretty stagnant except for the 
wandering German army.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is ahead of this pace).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BART - SAND): I hope you held back this turn.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BART): So close, yet so far, now you're dropped from the field.
That makes four riders dropped, all of whom will stay on the track.
Now, for the moves at the other end of the race....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HEART to BOOB):  Ya gotta have heart!  Cartoon girl vs
circulatory organ, no challenge.  If she doesn't go for
it, this breakaway should be worth a 2!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to HEART): You nailed that one.  You wonder if a
breakaway 2 is even worth it.  Now you've got those big
fours to use to lengthen the lead.....
