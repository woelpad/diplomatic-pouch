<p><br><p><br>We got all the subszines, a massive issue from me, and well, I don't know
how many pages it is going to be when I finally get it all done as I type
this, but it is going to be big, really big.
Speaking of big, I'm off to Holland for a week, unfortunately for little
pleasure and lots of business - probably not unlike Pete's experience
described below in many ways!
Enough!!
Read on and don't say I didn't warn you!!!

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
I'm not going to start any more new games (other than the Star Trek
game) until some games end.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR BERNIE OAKLYN</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Bernie, under this name, was most famous for producing one of
the hobby's great breeding grounds, <i>Le Front de Liberation
du Diplomacy</i>.
I would not be here today if it weren't for Bernie and many others
can say the same, including (but not limited to) Bob Olsen, Eric Ozog,
Terry Tallman, and Dan Stafford.
Bernie was one of the hobby's great personalities of the 1970's.
He was so controversial playing under his real name of Bernard (Buddy)
Tretick that he was practically forced to drop out and reinvent 
himself.
Among the real hobby old guard (around here represented by John Boardman
[who comments on this in the last <i>Graustark</i>], Rod Walker, and
Conrad von Metzke), he was never forgiven for his earlier sins and
trying to duck them by taking on a false identity.
Then, in his szine, you were confronted by his sons (e.g. James Alan
[really Jim Tretick] who is the one I saw most recently appearing in
hobby circles) playing in his games and occasional GM trickery when
Bernie would change moves or berate a player for doing things he did
not approve of.
As a player, Bernie's refusal to lie and insistence on proposing complex
long term alliances got him knocked out of virtually all of his games
first.
Still, he was lovable, good ol' Uncle Bernie!
I'd like to have him back, real badly.
Someone please find him.
I think he'd be fascinated that I bothered to look for him, even
if the likes of Boardman and Walker might grumble.
Go to it, only one more issue at the higher prize level!!

<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.
Go for these guys again.
Perhaps some of them now can be located via the Internet where they
weren't when you looked before.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what

toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.
No word on precisely what this means yet, could it mean that
they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?

<p>
Hello All,

<p>
I have been lurking here for quite some time and this is the first time I am
allowed to speak up.

<p>
I am Todd Hurley from Meyer/Glass Interactive (Chicago) and I am working on
Hasbro/ Avalon Hill/ Microprose's Diplomacy.  The team has been working on
this title for over a Year and we expect to ship in time for Christmas
(just), meaning in stores by Thanksgiving.

<p>
If you missed it Diplomacy was shown on the floor at E3 last week to a very
pleased crowd.

<p>
Here is a link to one article on the game with a screenshot:

<p>
http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article = /articles/019/147/diplomacy_e3.html

<p>
I will try to answer any questions posted in this forum, but, I am not an
employee of Hasbro and I do not speak for them (insert standard disclaimer
here).

<p>
Let's start out with some basic information...

<p>
<p>
<center>AI</center><br>

<p>
We have approached the game as a Multi-Player game first, and a single
player game second.  The AIs are good, but as many have pointed out, cannot
be as good as a human player.  It's just not as satisfing to stab an AI
player as your good buddy.  Firaxis is NOT involved as reported eariler in
the ng.

<p>
<center>Judges, PBEM and Network Play (oh my!)</center><br>

<p>
The Judges will NOT be shut down as far as I know.

<p>
We are commited to providing a PBEM solution for our customers and we are
currently exploring accepting Judge input and output. Network play is
carried out through IPX and TCP and the MSN Game Zone (www.zone.com).

<p>
<p>
<center>Maps</center><br>

<p>
We have the Europe 1901 ``classic" map only, other maps may or may not be
forthcoming, I don't know anything about this.  We have spend a great deal
of time on map art for the classic game.  There are a number of different
treatments for the classic map.

<p>
Hello all,

<p>
My name is Bill Levay, and I'm the producer for Hasbro's computer Diplomacy
game. Some of you know me personally, and some of you know me as ``the last
Avalon Hill employee." I've also been lurking here, paying attention to what's
been going on. It was tough not being able to respond to some of the comments,
musings, ``predictions", etc. BTW, this is my private e-mail address. I'll
respond from it, but I'd prefer if you wrote to me at my office address, which
is ahgames of hasbro.com (I got to snag it first.)

<p>
Some have seen the comment about ``finally being able to speak", and have taken
it in negative light. You shouldn't. The main reason for keeping quiet, was to
make sure that we didn't start to get everyone excited about the game until we
were sure we were going to meet our release date. I've talked to some of you
off-line, and you have been very supportive and helpful. As it is, the game was
rescheduled from a Gold date of 8/25 to 10/25, to include additional
functionality in the game that you guys requested, wished for, etc. Some of you
know me from my days working at Avalon Hill, and you know that I tell it like
it is. I'll be happy to answer letters, but you MUST understand that I have a
number of projects going, and I can answer letters only during my spare time.

<p>
I did take down Hace's name (I can be the hall monitor, can't I?), but just to
make sure, I'd like to talk to more people. I need to provide the developer
help in making sure that the PbEM game will support judge input and output.
Yeah, I remember reading all the sea-lawyers going on and on about how we were
going to shut down the judges... like I said, I'm sorry, but I wish I could
have responded. But, all's well that ends well. I have said this many times...
As an Avalon Hill gamer since 1968, as well as an Avalon Hill employee (who
never would have dreamed back in 1968, that he would be the one to turn out the
lights for the last time at AH) I can tell you that Hasbro is the best thing
that ever happened to Avalon Hill games. And I mean that regardless of being a
Hasbro guy or not. Speaking for the Interactive side, I can tell you that we
take the games very seriously, and we have a lot of high hopes and plans to
make a lot of people very happy. Hasbro, unlike the original Avalon Hill, does
not take it's customers for granted, and understands the love that we have for
these games. 'Nuff said.

<p>
Now, about the subject line. Our marketing dept. wants to have two focus groups
look at the game. The first is to be made up of gamers who have not heard of,
or played Diplomacy. The second group, per my request, is to be made up of YOU.
Well, the YOU that live in the Boston area, since we need to interview you in
person. So, seven of you lucky guys will get the chance to see the game
(although it isn't finished yet, you should be able to play it completely as
multi-player.) This is not the same thing as beta testing, which will come
later when it *is* more nearly complete. Here's the ad that the focus group
agency want me to place. I heartily apologise for the crass offer of money and
pizza, since I know that your motives are much loftier. Oh yeah, if and when
you play the game solo, I don't want to hear any whining about the computer
opponents, because they're not finished yet!!!!!!!!!!!! Got it? ;)

I don't think I have a video card at all, so I can't participate, even
though I only work a couple of miles from their focus group site.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Bill Levay (04 Jun 1999 17:34:28 GMT)</b>

<p>
<i>Responding to:</i> I'm probably the thousandth person to respond to this, 
though maybe only the tenth Brit, but I really would like to know what Hasbro 
is doing about the *Non-Computer* version of the game.
Is there going to continue to be such a thing? Is there going to
continue to be such a thing in Britain? The British Amateur Postal Hobby
would rather like to know. - Danny Collman, Birmingham, UK

<p>
Unfortunately I can't speak for the Hasbro Games Group (Parker Bros. and Milton
Bradley) but have left a message with their brand manager about Britain. I
don't know how Gibsons enters into it. I would <i>assume</i> (note: a guess) that
they either keep selling their version or they don't and a Hasbro version shows
up there. As I said, I will try to get a definite answer.

<p>
As far as what the boardgame version will look like, people at Origins and
Gencon should be able to see it live, plus when I go to Doncon (Avaloncon/BPA)
I'll have it with me for private viewing (Doncon is a gaming con, not a show
con.) I should be recognizable as the person who will win all heats plus the
final of Air Baron!

<p>
Here's a rough description. The rules are the standard rules, although I have
not seen an exact copy of them. I was told that they're pretty much using the
AH rules verbatim.

<p>
The map is a bit more colorful, it looks to me more like a History of the World
map in style (but not exactly.) It is of course Europe, with no changes to
borders or names. The armies are cannons and the fleets are battleships. Both
are metal.

<p>
HGG is also adding cardboard counters to show who currently owns a supply
center. I have to say that this is definitvely a convenient addition for FtF
play.

<p>
Finally, the developer of the HGG version is Larry Harris (designer of Axis &amp;
Allies.) I mention this because PB/MB don't tend to put credits in their rule
books.

<p>It is still time to send in your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
I plan to have my list in... well now it is NEXT time.
And here they are.... as I got down to doing this, after culling out the
losers and the mediocre, I had THIRTY-FIVE discs to consider for my top
CD's of 1998!!!
As I consider further below, some of those may drop out or into an
honorable mention list, but somehow this was a better year than I thought
it was on the music front.
Well, let's go to the lists:

<p>
<p><br>
<center><b>JIM-BOB'S BEST OF 1998 - PART I!!!!</center><br></b>

<p>
<p> <b>The Top Ten</b>

<p>
A few CD's really stood out for me this year.
With my relatively new five disc changer, I finally got into the habit of 
sticking a bunch of discs in, setting it on random and enjoying.
These were the ones that never got very far away from the changer:

<p>
The Mekons - <i>Me</i> (Quarterstick - [no US site that I know of.... but 
this British site is good]

<p>
 http://www.southern.com/southern/band/MEKON/):  
Any year with a new Mekons 
release is a good one, and when the greatest rock and roll band in the world 
produces something sublime, it is a GREAT one.
The trite thing to say is that there is something missing in lots of music as 
corporate interests keep it as an industry.
There are very few bands out there who have oodles of talent, lots of smarts,
and really just live the music to get beyond this.
The Mekons in that sense are more of a club than a band.
Their recent interactions with Kathy Acker have them a club with sex on the
brain, but mixed with their usual mordant curiosity, we get some really
raunchy, wacky, but deep stuff on <i>Me</i>.
For me, it's rekindled even more interest in the band, more so than at any time
since their exploration of goth in <i>Curse</i>.
I've talked about <i>Me</i> elsewhere too, just after it came out, so I won't
repeat lots of that.
And I rave about the Mekons so much that you're all probably tired of it anyway.
So instead, let me just urge you all to ``come and have a go, if you think you're
hard enough....''
While most games in this szine originally were named after characters in
<i>Rasselas</i> (where the szine name comes from), now most are named after
Mekons songs.
The ones on this CD are infectious, mixing in Susie Honeyman's violin, 
Sally Timms' vocals, Steve Goulding's firm and precise drum work, 
Tom Greenhalgh's multitalented musicianship, and of course Jon Langford's
pure genius to great effect.
I can't help but gush over the gorgeous harmonies that Sally and Jon give
us on ``Mirror'' juxtaposed with massive bad taste of ``Tourettes'' - this
is THE MEkons.
There undoubtedly are lots of other Club Mekons members chiming in, but 
everything on this record is uncredited.
Yes, they are <i>Me</i> and we are <i>Me</i>....
The new record is rumoured to be called <i>I Have Been To Heaven And Back:
Hen's Teeth and other lost fragments of unpopular culture Vol. 1</i> and is
a compilation of all sorts of oddities.
I haven't found it yet, but I will.
There is nothing so sure as a Mekons fan - don't we wish all music were
like this?
Sure we do.... 

<p>
Melissa Ferrick - <i>everything i need</i> (What Are Records? - 
http://www.war.com):
Whoa, baby.
Melissa (along with the next singer on this list) may just be the most 
challenging and affecting songwriter you are ever going to come across.
She made my list last year with her last CD, but this one just blew me away.
Melissa is tough, strong, funny, and persistently charming.
She also sucks you right in with an emotional honesty that just wacks you 
in the head.
She has a voice that ``lets go and lets you in'' as it growls, croons, and
bites off words.
And her guitar picking is sharp and percussive and this CD records it
brilliantly.
There are slow ballads such as ``I Like It That Way'' that picks up on
these themes of holding on and letting go, all at the same time.
``I Like It That Way'' goes on to pick up the tempo and volume with
the emotion in the middle, before coming back down at the end.
Then there are upbeat bouncers that are even, dare I say it, danceable
such as the title track and ``Asking For Love'' - about a bit too pretty
girl in a bar.
Every single track grabs me in some way, there is not a dog anywhere
to be found.
Then it finishes up with the stunner of the whole set, ``Don't Say Goodbye'',
that I just listen to over and over again for its poetry and its stark reality.
Melissa has a way of popping her voice up... ``I've got a big voice and 
I'll do anything for you... I promise I won't kill you and I promise I won't lie.''
Where the Mekons are a bit of an acquired taste, I think you'll adore this one
from first hearing and won't stop listening as you play it over and over and over
as I have.
No, you can't make love holding onto your fists, loosen 'em up and go buy this one.

Erin McKeown - <i>Monday Morning Cold</i> (tvp records, cassette only -

<p>
 http://www.netspace.org/tvprecords)
Erin McKeown is an enchanting songstress of Virginia/Providence vintage.
She is at the very beginning of her career, but it is a career destined
for success.
At present, she's trying to keep her primary focus on completing her
undergraduate degree here in town at Brown, while only touring in the 
summer.
This summer she is making her very first west coast swing.
I heavily encourage my musically literate west coasters to check her out
in these places on these dates (more info on above web page):
25 june - sherman oaks CA; 26,27 june - sandiego/santamonica CA;
29 june - san pedro CA; 30 june - san luis obispo CA;
1 july - san francisco CA; 2,3 july - monterey/ davis CA;
6 july - emeryville CA; 8 july - olympia WA;
9 july - eugene OR; 10 july - seattle WA w/ KATE WOLF and friends;
11 july - seattle WA; 14 july - bellingham WA;
and then from 15 july-22 july w/ VOICES on the VERGE midwest TOUR
(I'm not sure where exactly that is going...except that it 
includes Chicago and Valparaiso [famous for something other than 
basketball, I guess!!]).
Erin's skills with the guitar are unique, which really is saying something
given the long history of the instrument.
This really only can be fully appreciated live.
Before she gets really big and of necessity ends up in bigger rooms where
things will be different, you need to see her now.
It is an eclectic brew of jazzy, rockish, folkish, strange rhythms that
she bops and strums out on the guitar.
Now, let's get to this latest release (all still on cassette), 
<i>Monday Morning Cold</i>.
This is more of a demo tape that illustrates Erin's vast range at such
a tender age.
It is not as polished or ``complete'' as last year's mini-cassette, but it
has twice as many songs and even more high points.
She emphasizes the jazz motifs in three band pieces with upright bass and drums.
I expect this to be her eventual way of playing to wider audiences, though
live she can do it all herself in small rooms.
The highlight of these, ``Fast As I Can'', leads off the tape with a solid
backbone.
The ``Lullaby in 3/4'' is a truly incredible piece of extraordinary
sensitivity, though the Brown radio DJ's are a bit hard to take (from
a live broadcast).
She even does some silly electronic music on ``Glass''.
Yes, much of this is more interesting for the extraordinary future 
promise that it holds, but it still plays great all by itself.
Listening to her, you can't believe she's only about 20, though
the version of ``Something Comes'', from a live radio station broadcast,
is truly stunning - I listen to it over and over and over in the car -
and makes it clear that she wrote it in high school.
I expect the future to sound more like ``Softly Moses'', which appears on both
tapes and leads off Side 2 here.
Both ``Softly Moses'' and ``Something Comes'' are given more intensely personal
and effective readings on this tape, despite inferior sound quality.
Some of the songs were even recorded in the bathroom of her dorm at Brown.
At a recent concert, I was sitting about five feet from her while she
was singing her MOST intensely personal song, ``How To Open My Heart in
Four Easy Steps," which was one of the bathroom recordings.
This song was composed after seeing the movie <i>Titanic</i> twice - both
times alone!? - and trying to compose a Celine Dion ``power ballad''.
Yes, this attempt did fail miserably, and I'm sure Celine Dion couldn't
possibly handle singing this song, but in Erin's hands it is emotion
ripping gorgeous.
I'm serious when I tell you that it was hard to sit that close to her
while she was singing it!
I strongly recommend this tape for car listening (as I use it) where these flaws
disappear into the road noise and you can quickly and easily adjust volume for
each song to ideal levels.
I'm not sure how they deal with foreigners, if anyone from abroad has trouble
ordering an Erin McKeown tape, I'll be pleased to be an intermediary.
Order your cassette (either 2503 [the 1997 release] or 2504 [<i>Monday 
Morning Cold</i>]) by sending just $6 to tvp records; information bureau, 
cyber sub-unit; po box 344; providence RI 02901 or visit the ordering section 
of the website http://www.netspace.org/tvprecords for more details.
This is a REAL bargain at twice the price!!!
And finally, MARK this date on your calendars.... locals from around here are 
welcome to visit.
Saturday night September 11 (remember, it is Rosh Hashanah if that helps),
here in Providence in our very own artsy coffeehouse AS220, 
across the street from the theatre where my wife works, appearing together
for the very first time.... Melissa Ferrick and Erin McKeown. 
I've got it circled in red on my calendar.

<p>
Those are probably the top three.
I noticed the heavy female tilt (counting Susie and Sally in the Mekons).
There is a similar, if not quite so pronounced tilt among the other seven.
Let's take up Melissa and Erin's opposite number on the male side next.
In fact, I first picked up on Erin when she opened for Jonathan Richman
a few years ago....

<p>
Jonathan Richman - <i>i'm so confused</i> (Vapor Records - 
http://www.vaporrecords.com): This was a tremendous breakout year for 
Jonathan in so many ways.
I'm going to address one whole class of that breakout elsewhere in this
year's review, but I think this is a new record deal for our favorite
male singer/songwriter.
Vapor is distributed by Warner Brothers.
Old pal Ric Ocasek and lots of solid production (but not overdone) makes
for a positively gorgeous recording.
Songs like ``When I Dance'' and ``Hello From Cupid'' are taken directly
from the jaunty style that has been the backbone of the last twenty 
years of recording on the edge.
Then, there is ``Affection'' that is a really serious take on the need
for affection in the world, with some lessons taken from the tip of the
tongue that lies against the inside of the cheek.
This is just a stunning song live as well.
Old pal Tommy Larkins on drums is joined by Darryl Jenifer on bass for a
still quite spare sound.
The poignant ending of ``I Can't Find My Best Friend'' as the world
turns inside out when Jonathan can't find his (female) best friend
takes the sentimental Jonathan right to the edge.
The last thirty years of recorded music by this man spans an infinite
array of emotions.
Fantastic.
Check out this latest chapter.

<p>
Stereolab - <i>the group played ``Space Age Bachelor Pad Music''</i>
(Beggars Banquet - 

<p>
 http://www.beggars.com): Stereolab hit a few potholes
on some recent records, but this record hit a welcome new home run!
Stereolab is all about ambiance and if the ambiance doesn't come across
FIRST then all the technique in the universe won't help them.
BUT, this also is a technical achievement of great complexity.
The ONLY liner notes on the whole disc are a long explanation of
various key acoustic principles governing the creation and playback
of this disc.
Despite all this high falutin' stuff, the music still sounds great
and achieves ambient perfection on any reproducing medium (I'm listening 
to the disc on REALLY cheap stereo
headplugs - too cheap to even call them phones - plugged into my
very old Sony Discman and it still sounds fantastic!).
The combination of Mary Hansen's voice, the Farfisa organs, and the treacly
sound effects come to most effective fruition on ``We're Not Adult Orientated''
as indeed we are not....
it's here in two versions: a relaxing daydreaming version and an electrocharged
``New Wave Live'' version that gets me pogoing and must be a stunning closer in
concert.
This CD is a must have for all ambient music fans and a great introduction for
those who have not been seduced by the charms before.

<p>
Mark Cutler - <i>Skylolo</i> (Potters Field Records - http://www.mcutler.com):
No, this is not as good as Mark's ``Useful Things'' record, but that one is 
on my top ten recordings of the 1990's, so it isn't an insult to say that this
is merely one of the best ten of 1998.
Local Rhode Islander Tom Buckland and Boston whiz David Minehan co-produce.
Minehan is the addition from the previous team and the smoothness he generates
helps make this record better background music, but filing off Mark's rough
edges doesn't always serve the music.
The roughness of the dysfunctional ``This Family'' illustrates this most clearly
as it blows you away in concert and seems just that hairbreadth too pretty here.
Long time live crowd favorite ``I Could Get Used To This'' is degraded by
the use of female background singers on the chorus, in this opinion.
It makes me cry live, but not here, the background singers provide some
of the human contact that the song demands be missing.
Some of Mark's earlier efforts as the lead singer of the Raindogs suffer from
the same problem.
But I'm nitpicking.
Cutler is still one of the most biting songwriters around as the opening 
triplet going from the 
midget ``Skylolo'' to the bruising ``Know Me By Now'' to the poignant 
``Lie Next To You'' pulls you directly into the center of Mark's world.
``Call Me a Stranger''  and ``Kinda Girl'' have all of the brilliant 
songwriting with rhythm, guitar chops, and quirky lyrics that Mark
is known for and rewards repeated listenings.
Hey, listening to it again and writing about it reminds me yet again how
deep Mark Cutler's music is and no matter how many times I listen to it,
it still rewards.
Perhaps this will keep grabbing and grabbing...

<p>
Susan Tedeschi - <i>just won't burn</i> (Tone Cool Records - 
http://www.tonecool.com): I gotta have something rootsy on this list.
Susan's female growl really showed us how to ``Rock Me Right'' this year.
Susan gives a good mix of self penned numbers (``You Need to Be With Me''
and ``Found Someone New''), doing the songs of her producer (``Rock Me
Right'' and ``It Hurt So Bad''), and doing great versions of songs by
the great roots singers out there (``Little By Little'' from Junior Wells
and ``Angel From Montgomery'' from John Prine).
I have originals of both of these and she gets the snarly soul of Junior's and
the poignant balladry of Prine just right - remembering each one but also
making these songs her own.
Annie Raines' harmonica on the former is worthy of the masters and 
Tim Gearan's slide guitar on the latter is absolutely perfect.
Susan thanks one helluva list of inspirations too.
It starts with the voices of Irma Thomas and Etta James, continues with
the Island sound of Marley and Toots Hibbert, and ends up with Mahalia
Jackson.
In between are the obligatory nods to Dylan, Holiday, Charles, and Franklin
(no first names needed....) but it is these other touchstones which illustrate
the amazing range and depth such a young woman has.
Then I have to admit that Richard Weiss slipped in to write about Tedeschi in
this szine first AND he identified my failure to attend Susan's last appearance
here in downtown Providence.
Grrrreat backups, grrrrreat production, and grrrrreat singing and lead guitar
work from the star lead us to believe that the best is yet to come here.
Get on the bandwagon early, you're already late.

<p>
Dar Williams, Lucy Kaplansky, and Richard Shindell - <i>Cry, Cry, Cry</i>
(Razor and Tie Entertainment - http://www.razorandtie.com and
http://www.crycrycry.com):  Many of the
recordings on this list are pretty obscure, admittedly, but there's always
room for critically acclaimed and relatively popular records that also
deliver the goods.
I guess Dar, Lucy, and Richard come from the folky side of the house,
which might have hurt the popularity of this disc somewhat, but
I don't see a single reason why.
As Richard Shindell is reported to have said: ``Why don't we just do an
album of songs we love?''
Why not indeed!!??
I was familiar with almost half of the 12 songs to one degree or another,
each already a favorite or made more so through the versions here.
Then, other songs are quickly becoming favorites to equal degrees.
They grabbed some publicity by leading off with a stellar version
of REM's ``Fall On Me'', though that is by no means the best song
on the album.
The one that follows it - James Keelaghan's ``Cold Missouri Waters'' -
might be.
The version here is far superior to James' Green Linnet recording
and tells the story of the first use of the forest firebreak.
I like every song, but the highlights for me was having Dar sing
Greg Brown's ``Lord, I Have Made You a Place'' and the a cappella
``Northern Cross'' (from someone named Leslie Smith - one of the
ones I'd never heard of before).
``Down By the Water'' (Jim Armenti) even rocks a bit.
Then, they finish up with the two ``can't help but cry'' songs.
``I Know What Kind of Love This Is'' is extremely simple, by Nerissa
Nields, whom I also think I should get to know better.
Then Richard does his own ``The Ballad of Mary Magdalen'', again with
Dar Williams on lead vocal.
Dar is the brilliant singer here, but the group effort adds greater
depth to the result.

<p>
Lucinda Williams - <i>Car Wheels On a Gravel Road</i> (Mercury -

<p>
 http://www.mercuryrecords.com/mercury): Lucinda has been a 
cult figure for some time, considered to be one of the great 
singers of the 1990's who'd never been properly recorded.
This recording ends that streak.
Whizbang producer Roy Bittan chips in on organ and accordian in addition
to fixing up the production.
Emmylou Harris and Steve Earle show up to lend their not inconsiderable
reputations to the project without weighting it down.
The guitar work on ``Drunken Angel'' and ``I Lost It'' (THREE guitarists
on each) is all essential without being cloying.
Then, just as you think you've heard everything, about three quarters of
the way through, the quiet screaming of ``Greenville'' starts blowing you
away.
Emmylou Harris does simple but perfect backing harmony vocals on the
second verse and the rest of the choruses.
That's it.
Then, a bit later comes ``Joy'', with FOUR guitarists (I'm not even 
counting the bass player here), which has a simple message of the 
``search for joy''.
Then we finish up with one of those quiet teary eyed songs, ``Jackson''.
These songs feel like you've known them all your life the first time
you hear them and you just can't forget Lucinda singing them, once
you they worm their way into your heart.
Wow.

<p>
Philip Pickett - <i>The Bones of All Men and of several remarkable curiosities
therein occurring being a compendium of Daunces, Pavannes, Steps and such
played this tiem by Mr.&nbsp;Philip Pickett with Mr.&nbsp;Richard Thompson and The
Fairport Rhythm Section</i> (Rykodisc - http://www.rykodisc
.com):  And last
but absolutely not least, we have Ghod Richard hooking up with Philip Pickett,
Sharona Joshua, and three guys of some considerable acquaintance - Dave Pegg,
Simon Nicol, and Dave Mattacks.
I love all of the old recorder, crumhorn, and shawm medieval music.
Philip Pickett is a master of it.
Sharona Joshua is Pickett's keyboard player wife.
Sounds like they need some rhythm instruments and a couple of great guitarists.....
go no further than the best of the Fairport Convention crowd.
The music comes from the 400 year period between 1200 and 1600 and sounds
just perfect in the hands of these diverse musicians.
Ghod is occasionally intrusive, sometimes supportive, but always interesting.
All the Ghod/Fairport fans will find it a must have, but I think it
will be attractive to everyone.

<p>
I'd be interested in hearing what people think of all of these records.
These ten came out and hit me over the head as I was gathering things up.
The rest of the list and the honorable mentions will come in Part II, next issue.

<p>
<p><br>
<center>***TIME TO VOTE***</center><br>

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
two songs (5 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
You also get ONE B-52 song vote (although you can add votes from your
main allotment if desired) and THREE Drug Song votes which will be
held in a separate category.
The other ``special'' bullpens must be voted on from your main allotment
of votes.
I decided that I WILL print running totals and print the names of the
people who have voted.
Also, you guys wrote some great stuff about the songs, so I've printed
that too!
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!
Everything that started in the bullpen started with one vote.

<p>
To encourage voting early, five voters at random will receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff).
I will take these voters at random every other issue, starting with
this issue, and draw one randomly, so early voters get FIVE chances
to win, but no one will be allowed to win twice.
I'm also giving the round one voters below five chances in said drawing,
those in the second round four, and so on, to more heavily penalize the
chances of those last minute voters and reward these pioneers!
That should do it!!
Since this issue is monstrous, I am pushing back my voters to next 
issue and my prize awards likewise.
Prizes will be awarded in issues 220, 222, and 224.
Get your Round 3 votes in now if you don't see your name below!!!
You each will receive three chances in the drawing for the next 
five dollar prize. 
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper, Tony Dickinson,
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters are John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
John wins the second prize and in future drawings these people will
have five chances, just as the Round 1 voters.
Round 2 E-Mail voters get four chances and are Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; something from the B-52's;
the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

 Hiya Jim,
Cheers fer yet another <i>TAP</i> ... hmmm looks like `Nirvana' are
doing well in the `Bullpen', can't believe that I missed `The Cure's' -
``In Between Days'' (total classic) *sigh* ... so it goes.

<p>
I think that I'll go the same as Scott (Morris) if I win
anything it's only right that it goes towards the compilation defo tape
yeah? ... OK?

<p>
Ummm re the last band in the `Drug Special Bullpen' i.e. `The
Magic Mushroon Band' errrr only just noticed but `Ditto Skunk' WASN'T
supposed to be my nomination, it was rather a comment as in ditto `Skunk
Anansie' (another band) i.e. their band names ALONE should get 'em in
the section! Oooops ... not that it really matters I guess :-S
<i>((Well, no, but I've dropped them anyway.

Yo, Jim-Bob -

<p>
Rick Desper really had a good list of the century's greatest sporting
feats.  I would add Secretariat in 1973, Muhammad Ali's swath of
destruction through the heavyweight division in the 1960's, Jim Thorpe's
winning the decathlon and the pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics, and
Christy Mathewson's three shutouts in the 1903 World Series (that was a
five-game series, so he pitched those shutouts over the span of six
days).  For single-event performance, there's no topping Chamberlain's
100-point game; maybe Secretariat in the Belmont comes close.

<p>
I'm not a Pirates fan, but there has to be a case made for Harvey Haddix
as the greatest single-game pitching performance.  Twelve PERFECT
innings in a row?  And he loses in the 13th when a guy reaches on an
error and later scores on the only hit of the game?  How much of a
bummer is that?

I've joined up with <i>Octopus</i> for RR and fully intend to
contribute at length to <i>TAP</i> very shortly. I shall
remain a corresponding member rather than a playing 
one as my experiences with Diplomacy have been entirely
unforgettable. Playing on-line with the possibilities
for high-speed negotiating does appeal, I must admit.
Maybe when I've played a few rounds of RR and found a
place to play Cricketboss or equivalent. Yes, I've
found the sites: www.cricketgames.com and
www.ultra-sports.com/cricket are where to look.

<p>
The comments on Kumble's feat are very respectable. I
feel no need to expand. The music voting looks complex
and well beyond my experience. Stuck in Canadian
country and m.o.r. territory I don't get to see or hear
too much of the latest music. For my sins I am a
collector of, and minor authority on, surf and hot rod
music. But my tastes span widely. REM's <i>Up</i> is my
current favourite, mainly because of the wonderful
tribute to Brian Wilson on ``At My Most Beautiful''. 
Has anyone directed you to Imagination? Probably not -
what am I saying, given your published list???!!!
<i>((Huh???!!!))</i>
Nobody here has heard of Robbie Williams, so the whole
scene is a little distorted. I'm discovering Canadian
country - it ain't all bad. Great Big Sea and Prairie
Oyster are wonderful!

<p>
I was involved in music in the early 70s. DJ and
concert promoter at college. So mainly prog rock and
psychedelia. Met lots of interesting people - but I'm
afraid the B52s passed me by ... 
<i>((We don't discuss that period much around here any
more, but over sixteen years or so of pubbing, we've 
talked about practically everything at one time or another.
I do have a lingering love for early 70s prog rock and 
psychedelia, though.
Did you ever hear of Michael Perlitch?
He is my favorite unknown superstar of that period.
He had a stunning song called ``Pete the Bondage Freak''.
I also loved that early Yes, the Rick Wakeman solo records,
and obscure German psychedelia like Klaus Schulze. 
Then, of course, there was The Nice (better than ELP) and
Nektar.
Is that what you're talking about???))</i>

<p>
My fledgling web page
at www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Hotel/8117 shows
what I'm currently interested in. If Stephen Agar can
be persuaded to rummage through the old copies of
<i>Howay The Lads</i>, he'll come across the one I edited in
which I published a spoof game based on a rock
festival, along with my list of all-time guaranteed
disco floor-fillers. #27 I think. It dates from the late 70s so it
might not mean much now. But there are
one or two records on there which I'd judge as good candidates for a
Millenium collection. ``All Right Now'', Free; ``Brown Sugar'', 
``Honky Tonk Woman'', ``Street Fighting Man'', etc.; 
Anything by the sublime and subliminal Sweet.
<i>((The three songs above are all Stones classics, right?
I've added them to the appropriate bullpen with one vote.
I thought about ``All Right Now'', but I have it on one of my 
car tapes, and it really doesn't seem to hold up very well when
I listen to it over and over now.
The production values or something I can't quite pinpoint, but I
keep thinking it should be a better song, but isn't.
Still, I've also tossed it in above, since I was thinking about it.
Now, you should pop off your votes!))</i>

<p>
I was interested to see that, a few months later, people are
finally reading my impeachment commentary.  I don't want to
waste too much more time on this but...

<p>
Jody, you talk about my comments about Reagan's ``hare-brained"
foreign policy without making reference to the fact that I was
talking about Iran-Contra.  This is why it was hare-brained:

<p>
1) The Iranian-backed terrorists would kidnap an American.

<p>
2) The Iranians would ``negotiate" a release, getting arms they needed
for their war with Iraq.

<p>
3) The Iranians would go back to step 1.

<p>
The spooks running the Reagan policy thought they were so clever.
They were outwitting the Democratic Congress, in the name of 
``helping the Contras".  The problems

<p>
a) they took extra-constitutional measures to raise the money.
The Constitution does not allow the Executive Branch to allocate
funds on its own, without Congressional oversight.

<p>
b) every time a hostage was released, another one was taken.  The
Iranians must have thought we were total idiots.  

<p>
c) the entire plan was done in secret, and against the general wishes
of the American public.  When exposed, there was a general
unwillingness on the part of the President to stand behind what he 
had done.  

<p>
Jody's statement:  ``And Clinton's foreign policy would be...what?
It seems to be something like:  threaten a lot and use bombs a lot."

<p>
I suggest that you read up a bit more.  There is an actual foreign
policy here, which is not only Clinton's, but is shared by the
NATO alliance.  Perhaps you should do a web search with the key
words ``ethnic cleansing".  Or, you could do what I do, watch
NATO press conferences on CNN.  CNN has had a lot of very graphic
photos of the slaughter which has happened.  They've shown
pictures of rows of corpses, lined up in fields in Kosovo.

<p>
The whole issue is enough to turn a lot of stomachs in Europe.
I think the Europeans are much more emotionally involved in this
campaign than the Americans.  What is quite interesting is that this
is the first time the Germans have had their troops involved in
a foreign campaign since the 40s.  (And personally, I think it's
OK to let Germany and Japan out of the penalty box now, but I
digress.)  And this involvement is in spite of the fact that the
Greens are part of the ruling coalition.  The Greens are pacifists,
and they have a much stronger political presence in Germany than
any leftist force in the US.  However, they, and most Germans, are
rather sensitive to the idea of stopping genocide.  Having spent the
last 50 years listening to people lecture them about the Holocaust,
I sense a deep feeling, even among the Greens, that this time, 
the Germans are going to do something positive.  The moral issues
here are deeply compelling to a lot of people.  It's not about
who owns what oil field, or whose shrine is being threatened.

<p>
<i>((I agree.
It looks like things are breaking now.
I had long thought that if NATO could show resolve, that Serbia
would break down before winter, when they would not be able to 
contemplate a winter without power and water.
What is surprising me is that it is June and not September.
That means we did even more damage to ``creature comforts'' in
Serbia than was widely reported, correcting the damage will take
longer than I thought (i.e. they will need all summer to get ready
for winter), or they're up to something else.
I think this will show in the long run that air war campaigns will
be able to be more and more effective as we get more and more attached to our
technologies.))</i>

<p>
I don't know whether Jody is questioning whether NATO should be
involved at all, or whether we should be more aggressively involved.
But the kind of cheap shot he took is typical of the rudderless
Republican leadership these days.  With Gingrich gone, they cannot
make up their minds what to oppose and what to support.  They seem
to be just making a knee-jerk opposition to everything that Clinton
does.  Perhaps some time in the next year and a half, the
Republicans will realize that Clinton is not running for any more
elections, and that, if they continue to make every issue a personal
conflict between themselves and Clinton, they will lose even
worse in 2000 than they did in 1998.  

<p>
Well, I really didn't want to get drawn into a Kosovo debate.  
Right now I'm completely furious about the bombing of the Chinese
embassy.  By the way, nobody here believe it was an accident.  
It's hard for me to forcefully argue the idea that the CIA could
be so competent (even though I believe they can be) since I know
also that the CIA is also quite capable of deciding to pretend
to be incompetent.  Also, my German teacher has taken to
pontificating
recently about how the Kosovo conflict is just about the American
drive for more power.  Worse, there is a woman from Belgrade in the
class.  Should I try to explain to her that the people from my
country are bombing the people from her country because we believe
that her leader is the moral equivalent of a Hitler?  Do I dare 
use the name Hitler in the presence of Germans?  She is, quite
understandably, extremely worried for the safety of her family.  
This upsets me greatly, and I worry that she, and the other students
in the class, will somehow identify me, the only American there, as
the personification of What is Wrong With the US.  

<p>
The whole Kosovo mess gets me quite upset.  I think that NATO is
going into new ground here which is redefining what the alliance is
about, and I'm not sure that I like the redefinition.  But should
we sit back and do nothing?  It is so easy for people to criticize
what others have not done.  Actually trying to become involved
oneself
is much harder.  Given the political instability of Russia (Yeltsin's
approval rating is lower than 10%, and dropping, and it looks
like he's going to dissolve the Duma soon and rule by decree) and
the increasing tension between the US and China, I have very real
fears that the current mess could get out of control.
Well, that turned into a long letter.
I did get to see the Knicks beat the Heat last night.  Bwa-hah.
Too bad they couldn't both lose that series.

<i>((One comment on the ``allocating money without Congressional Oversight".
Be assured that I agree with you in all substantial respects, but in
practice the government does most of its "budget allocation" work without
much serious Congressional oversight.  The Congress is more like gnats
harassing a hiker through the woods.  If they REALLY, REALLY concentrate
their forces and efforts they can dissuade the hiker from taking a 
particular path, but more commonly the hiker still goes wherever he 
or she was going and puts on a mosquito net if it gets really bad.
But then, of course, the hiker has trouble seeing and is more likely
to slip and fall on the rocks.... pretty neat analogy, eh?
The lesson to serious Social Science students of Government is that
the effective operation of the Government requires loyal, ethical
Government employees (read hikers) who take on taxpayer interests
as their own.  In my various governmental roles, I have never hesitated
to raise these concerns, even when they clearly are not welcome.))

<p>
((How many of you have noticed the recent flare up of the extremely sedate 
15 year long war between India and Pakistan over the remote Siachen Glacier??
Have you wondered what ***REALLY*** sparked its recent acceleration??
I have a theory.
On Sunday, May 23, the venerable <b>New York Times</b> had a feature above the
fold front page article, with color pictures, by Barry Bearak describing the
weird conditions (rifles must be warmed to shoot at that altitude and temperature)
and slow pace and stalemate in this war - I'd always been aware of it, it
was the answer to a number of obvious trivia questions.
Just a few days before publication of the article, both sides reinforced their
positions, and the week after the article was published there was more killing,
fighting, and combat aircraft downed than in the entire 15 years of the war previously.
Why was that, do you think??
Could it have been the hot lights from the <b>Times</b> reporter and flash
photographer that heated up this little conflict?
No, say it ain't so!
Well, yes, I do think so.
If the heat of the media's attention can actually turn little conflicts into
full blown wars, I think we're getting ourselves in real trouble.
In this case, I'm absolutely positive that first India, and then Pakistan,
saw the opportunity for the <b>Times</b> article to provide them with the
world stage to play out their petty battles over this absolutely useless
glacier.
It's akin to the US and Mexico battling it out in the muddy basin of the 
Rio Grande on the Texas border because they want to own some more mud.
The problem here is that the Glacier is the border, but it is 50 miles wide
at its widest point.))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Breaking Away is almost full for the next opening, see the sign-up 
list discussion under the game below.
This game will appear in David Partridge's subszine <i>Tinamou</i>.
See the subszine for more details.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
This will be the last Diplomacy game opening until a game or two ends.
Even though there has been no interest yet, perhaps some will develop
if it is my only opening.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
No interest in this game?
I really want to run this.
I guess I gotta work on my map and publish it.

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JAN 1 - 1751): On New Year's day, at the dawn of an amazing era, the great 
Netherlands proudly announced the formation of a new ruling party.  This new 
government, assembled by a strong fascist element with an expansionist 
ideology is to be formally called the National Indigenous Kvetch Ethos.  Or 
NIKE for short.  The NIKE party is sponsored by Budweiser and Fruit of the 
loom. The NIKE party ran on a ticket of increased productivity (through 
expansion) increased wages (through expansion) and establishing the 
Netherlands at its rightful place at the head of the table in Europe and 
abroad (through expansion).  Plus lower taxes.

<p>
(JAN 2 - 1751): During a press conference NIKE prime Minister Sir Earl Prink 
announced sweeping reforms for all major industries.  These included less 
taxes, less environmental oversight and a lower drinking age.  The lone 
newspaper not run by the state ran shamelessly tawdry articles on 
preferential treatment by the government to those that bankrolled their 
campaign and was promptly shut down.  ``We will NOT allow those LIB-er-ALS to 
attempt to subvert our government."  Prime Minister Prink was heard to say as 
he exited the stand.  ``Freaking media can suck my...."  He was spirited off 
in his chariot provided by Charlie's Hardware store.

<p>
(JAN 15 - 1751): The NIKE government announced that Prime Minister Prink would 
be vacationing in his mountain retreat to ponder his next reforms.  A 
spokesperson pointed out that this would be a working holiday as evidenced by 
the fact that his entire secretary corps and every intern on staff would be 
in attendance at the retreat.

<p>
(JAN 30 - 1751): Prime Minister Prink regretfully announced that the NIKE 
party would be forced to raise taxes instead of lower them due to the 
mobilization of the nation's military and lowered tax revenue from the tax 
decrease on certain industries.  Pink also gave the famous ``Bronze Star" 
award to his undersecretary of the economy for inventing the ``flush down 
theory of economics"  This now famous theory states that if the captains of 
industry are not taxed at all, then their massive wealth would spiral down to 
the masses.  In related news Prink actively denied ``sleeping with those 
women" referring to the bevy of pictures showing scantly clad females in mid 
frolic with Prink who was wearing only some boxer shorts.  Prime Minister 
Prink then went into a two hour discussion on the nuances and subtleties of 
the word ``did."

<p>
(FEB 6 - 1751): The NIKE party issued a statement denying that the corporate 
sponsorship and apparent exchange of money for influence had anything to do 
with the direction of the Netherlands.  
``I am sick of this CRAP!  This is not a race to the bottom.  If that were the 
case Austria would already rule the world.  (smattering of laughter)  Look, 
see the Netherlands is on a course.  We are headed on this course and it is 
in a direction.  It's really like a tunnel.  YES!  a tunnel and we are a 
train headed for the tunnel.  Sure, the tunnel looks dark and scary. (nods of 
vague understanding by the audience)  But the train is headed in a direction. 
 We must stay the course.  I feel for the people of the Netherlands.  I feel 
all of your pain.  I feel the pain of your daughters and sisters.  I am for 
them and hope that they are for me.  I just wish I could council each and 
every one of them."

<p>
(FEB 15 - 1751): Prink announces a cultural exchange program with China. In a 
rare unguarded moment he was heard to say that he wanted to meet some Asian 
``chicks" and that it was his understanding that the Chinese culture had its 
girls under control.

<p>
(FEB 26 - 1751): In his first major address on world affairs <font face=symbol> &lt; </font
>please no cheap 
shots<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> Prime Minister Prink made it be known that while the Netherlands will 
seek to expand its influence throughout the world it seeks to do so in a 
peaceful way.  ``If the world powers will join the Netherlands in a joint 
erection, we can all come together and find a warm embrace of a piece.  Ask 
not the Netherlands for sacrifice.  Ask not the Netherlands to explain the 
deranged ramblings of the Austrians, but DO ask the Netherlands to share good 
fortune and good will.  If the heads of state engage in anything 
controversial, let it be of the personal nature, as it should be."  
(thunderous applause)  Thank you and God Bless us everyone."

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I think people are starting to get smart with this game.
Unlike last time, there is no way to cross all around the 
board, except for Jody's army in Burgundy, which sits astride
the line between the black hole regions.
Also, just one province (Brest) was hit more than once,
but we hit precisely the same number of supply centers as in 1901.
There are 19 more of those SC's out there for you to vie for.
Go to it.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MIKE to SARA):  You are not a vitrioleuse, by the way.  Your public and
private words have been other than acidic.  Sucking up to the GM is your
choice but he's more amenable to abuse than flattery, unlike the average
pubber.  However much of a sucker I may be, though, I cannot let 1901's
100% nukage go without SOME response or I'd lose my deterrent capability
in negotiation.  But I did order one nuke as you requested.

<p>
(SARA-MIKE): O yes, I have already encountered that ``Beware of Switchblade
Sara'' stuff in the <i>Cheesecake</i> game ``No Service'' where I am playing
Russia.
Russ Rusnak (Austria) used the ploy to sucker Paul Milewski (Italy) to
stab me for my Turkish dots and Rumania.
Russ got 3 SCs and Paul only 1 SC from the stab.
We are now up to Spring 1905 and I predict a win for Austria.
After which Russ, not me, will be the highest rated <i>Cheesecake</i> player.

<p>
(JOHN BOY to RICHARD: Hey Mike!

<p>
(JOHN - SARA): I tried to reply to your suggestions, but apologize for being 
late.  Please try to send it to Mr. Burgess next time, I think it will be 
faster.  I for sure will work with you next year.
	
<p>
(JODY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JOHN): I meant to try to coordinate something with you, but things
have been a little crazy lately and I never got the letter sent. Anyway, I
tried to guess some moves which I hope will go well with your moves.

<p>
(JOHN-SARA): Funny thing about that press last time.
I clearly remember the first two sentences.
I remember the last two not at all.
One might suspect a Boob malfunction.

<p>
(BARNDANCER to HEATHEN): Hope you have better luck in that corner country 
than I did, or you Dad did in life.  See you later on the boob tube.

<p>
(DOCTOR RICHARD WEISS <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MISTER JIM BURGESS): The latest scientific
studies show that all mice and rats have cancer.

<p>
(JODY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> RICHARD): You want war, you got it.

<p>
(GERM-BOOB): Who the Hell would bomb Hell?  What is this, a Robin Williams
movie?

<p>
(JOHN BOY to BOOB): Find 'em.

<p>
(SARA-JIM BURGESS): By and large, people who enjoy teaching 
animals to roll over will find themselves happier with a dog.

<p>
(JODY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BOOB): I'll take chit from anyone! Just don't need it  ;-)
      
<p>
(MIKE to JODY):  I offer no chits, no tokens, no commemorative
medallions, no stone money from Yap in Micronesia, no proxy markers, no
casino chips, no flaxscript, no hempscript, no junk bonds, not even
Federal Reserve floating paper.  Don't know why Jim asked if you'd take
any from me.
      
<p>
(BARNOLIAN THINKTANK/DREAMTANK):
``If we fight a war and win it with H-bombs, what history will remember
is not the ideals we were fighting for but the methods we used to
accomplish them.  These methods will be compared to the warfare of
Genghis Khan who ruthlessly killed every last inhabitant of Persia."
(Hans A. Bethe) 
                                                         
<p>
(SANDY - SARA): We Women of the Web have to ally.  Sisterhood is Powerful!  
Sock it to those Hussein Jock-heads.
	
<p>
(SARA-RICHARD): But of course my gynecologist is a woman.
A male gynecologist is like an auto mechanic who never owned a car.

<p>
(MOTORCYCLE MANIA - PLAINFIELD): Those new Honda Heads are big.  What you 
got plans for, dude?

<p>
(SARA-SANDY): For the record, last movement turn I ordered my army
from Prussia to Rumania via Black Holes Baltic Sea, Sweden, Norway,
Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Holland, Belgium, English Channel, Mid-Atlantic
Ocean, Portugal, Spain, Western Mediterranean, Tunis, Tyrrhenian Sea,
Rome, Naples, Ionian Sea, Aegean Sea, Smyrna, Ankara, Constantinople, and
Bulgaria.  (22 Black Holes traversed, that's not too many.)
<i>((This time, the most Black Holes that any unit can possibly 
traverse is 21, and I believe there is just ***ONE*** unit which 
can perform that feat.
Any guesses as to which unit that is and who is its commander??))</i>

<p>
(MIKE BARNO to KURT OZOG):  You should have been more specific when you
said you could use five nukes (in ``So Good it Hurts" press).  You didn't
say whether you wanted them delivered on their launchers full of fuel,
or in flight with detonators armed.  I figured the latter would be a
more effective demonstration of the need to be careful of the little
details when dealing with nukes.

<p>
(OLD FART to WEISS-GUY):  Honoring hobby historical traditions is itself
an old hobby historical tradition.  Tongue-in-cheek, of course, but done
for decades.  I don't know if anyone nuked the GM in old nuclear
variants (Tretick had one in <i>Le Front de Lib du Dip</i>), but I've been
doing it in NYEED (without the Black Hole variation) for a few realtime
years now.  It just seems so RIGHT when the GM is who he is.

<p>
(JODY to BOOB): That message was directed at Heath, not you. And BTW, I
don't think I'm in last place, am I? At least not yet, eh!?

<p>
(BOOB to JODY AND OLD FART): Uh.... well... I guess you're right.

<p>
(SARA-HEATH): Whatever happened to <i>Naima Equinox</i>?
The deadline was supposed to be 5 March, and I still have not
received it as of 16 May.
Do you still want me to be on the standby list for the regular diplomacy
game (assuming it ever got underway)?
<i>((In late breaking news, just as publication was wrapping up,
the esteemed Mr.&nbsp;Gardner notified me and others that he was preparing
to resume publication.
He had been having severe financial cashflow problems that prevented 
him from having enough funds to publish.
I guess you missed that announcement awhile back?
He also wondered whether he was gone long enough that he had to 
come up with a new name and start all over at issue #1!!!!
I told him he didn't have to do that, but he might, just to
warn everyone.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(PALACE OF GLORY AND GILDED HOOKAHS to DUAL MONARCHY IN CALI EXILE):
The Russian northern build caused me to change my order.  Whichever of
us was not blocked should next support the move that was blocked by the
Ukrainian battalion, if any.

<p>
(SKYWALKER to ALL): I apologize about the lack of communication.  I am not
used to working 40 hours a week (which
is not even all that much to begin with) and I have gotten real lazy.  I
will get better.

<p>
(FROM ROME):
The Italian people are in mourning today, due to the passing of Pope Pervert 
the II (a.k.a. the Pacifist Pope). The Pope was found early this morning on 
``the Throne." It appears that he was assassinated with a case of bacon and 
several pounds of Brie cheese. The assassin, obviously realizing the Pope's 
gluttonous appetite, shipped the case of dead swine from an address in 
Vienna. It now appears his Holiness polished off the bacon and cheese 
sometime last night. While trying to ``pass a block to make more room for 
nibbles,&#228;s the Pope would say, it appears kindly Pope Pervert strained to 
the point of having a major stroke or brain aneurysm. Only after an autopsy 
can the people know for sure. The autopsy is planned for later in the week, 
if the Pope can be removed from the porcelain fixture.
     
<p>
A ``Man of Gawd," going by the name of Guido, has taken over the holy 
duties until further notice. Guido is at the moment making a fortune off of 
his ``Porky Pontiff on the Potty" and ``Kill a Pig for Christ" T-shirts. When 
asked about his T-shirt shop and the rather tacky best selling shirts, his 
reply, after a long drag on his Chesterfield King, was ``I listen ta what Gawd 
tells me... ya know?" He then slugged down the last of his bottle of vino and 
turned back to his domino game.

<p>
(ENGLAND to RUSSIA, FRANCE AND GERMANY): Buddies?  Sort of like Matthau,  
Lemmon, Loren and Margaret.

<p>
(OTTOMAN GRAND COUNCIL to RASPUTIN'S CHAMBERBOY):  We are not yet
convinced that you can meet your claim of handling our leader
diplomatically.

<p>
(NUMBER 10 DOWNER STREET):  I am in the midst of a change of jobs this month
and the little time I spend worrying about Dip has mostly vaporized.  And of
course you, my many friends, are obviously so consumed.

<p>
(MIKE to LUKE):  Kick ass on your finals then give this game some
attention so we can enjoy it more even if you still end up being
overrun.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that Luke has moved back to his summer address. 

<p>
2) Note the large number of ``miswritten'' orders.
I use the following abbreviations in my adjudications: otm  =  on the move;
nso  =  no such order; nsu  =  no such unit; uno  =  unordered;
and imp  =  impossible.
I actually got to use all five of them just once in the above adjudication.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to BLACK SEA FISHES): Please tell me if there's a Russian fleet
on top of the water.  If there is, the sharks among you can get ready
for blood in the water.

<p>
(ROME to VIENNA):  You see, the problem is that all your neighbors need
builds, and your dots just happen to be the only source for such
commodities.
<i>((Somehow, I don't think he lost as many as you thought he would...))</i>

<p>
(VENICE to MOSCOW):  Now behave yourself, and maybe we'll let you live....
<i>((Big men talk like this when they are on the verge of removals.))</i>

<p>
(LAWYER to ARSONIST): Hey, Goz, you burned down any more of your
neighbors' buildings?  I guess it makes for a more scenic view once
those ugly buildings are out of the way.  And it makes such a pretty
fire . . .

<p>
(GERMANY to GM):  I'll have you know my Grammar spell-checks everything I send
out.  Of course, the old girl's eyesight isn't what it used to be...

<p>
(BOOB to GERM): Funny like a Germ.... lucky for you I love bad puns.
Are you also admitting how expert you are on the bordering provinces
to Yorkshire??
Seems I saw something in your subszine.....
would you have turned in your fellow player?
Say it ain't so, War.... ren.

<p>
(GERMANY to LAST SEASON'S GERMANY):  We should do lunch some time.

<p>
(SPORTS MUSINGS FROM CENTRAL INDIANA): My predictions for Major League
Baseball for the next 10 years:  (1) The Brewers, Reds, Pirates, Expos,
Royals, A's, and Twins will not win another playoff game until the revenue
structure of MLB changes.  (2) I won't enjoy watching baseball with
athletes older than 10 until that happens.

<p>
<i>((I would agree with you on your baseball comments, except my two
favorite teams (the Red Sox and Giants) are competing despite
not being among the really powerful teams.  As long as the 
Orioles stay in last place, I'll cheer.))</i>

<p>
The Orioles have only proved that spending a lot of money doesn't guarantee
success (in fact, they do that a lot of years...I suspect a real idiot in
the owner's box).  The teams I listed prove that NOT spending a lot of money
guarantees failure.

<p>
Additionally, there are a number of teams, my beloved Cubs included, that
can only afford to compete in 1 year of every 4, and that's with them in the
poorest (money-wise) division in baseball.  San Diego and Florida are 2
others in this category.  They had their successful years ('98 and '97
respectively) and then had a fire sale.  They'll hope to save up for another
run early next decade.  I'm sure their fans are all a-twitter over that.

<p>
The Red Sox and Giants might hold on for a wild-card entry each.  But the
money says `no'.  There was a list in the paper yesterday of the 79 players
that make $5M+ in MLB.  56 of those play for only 10 of the 30 teams.
Phooey.
<i>((Red Sox are looking good, but at the expense of ANY suspense in
the American League.
They may be joined by the Yanks, Indians, and Rangers in clinching playoff
spots by the All Star Break.
The Giants have been slipping..... heal fast, Barry!!))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): Is it just me, or are you repeating press
items?

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): It's probably just you.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): Is it just me, or are you repeating press
items?

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): It's probably true.

<p>
(UTTERLY, COMPLETELY FEARLESS HOCKEY PREDICTION): Toronto over Dallas in
the finals.  Maybe.

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): You're probably blue.

<p>
(YOUNG LUKE to YOUNG ANAKIN): Dad!  I never knew you weren't so damned
ugly!  Glad I finally got to see this movie; now I feel like I really
know you.

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): He's probably you.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - TURKEY): Not sure if my e-mails are getting through to your new 
address. But feel free to throw any war secrets my way. There's always 
room for diplomacy and propaganda.  

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): It's probably new.

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA): Now, calm down.  This isn't our real army going to
Serbia.  These are just the lawyers, here to do a title search on the
supply center, to see if you REALLY own it.

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): It's probably yours.

<p>
(SKYWALKER to ALL): I apologize about the lack of communication.  It is
mainly due to hecticness, not because I am slowly dying.

<p>
(BOOB to EMMERT): It's probably your breath.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Since I like this game and am learning how to do this and have to
put my new knowledge to good use, I will start another game.
I'll keep the sign-up list here so that interested parties will see it
as they peruse the szine.
All games will start when they have precisely six players and for the moment
I will keep the game opening list always on.
This game will continue to be free, like Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire.
Currently in line for the next game (to be Version 2.3) are: 
Luke Dwyer, David Partridge, Rick Desper, Eric Brosius, John Schultz,
Warren Goesle, John Harrington
all have expressed interest in this game.
Plus I am interested in playing.
I was going to run this one, but 
David has volunteered to run a game in <i>Tinamou</i>, so
I'm going to let David start his game first,
Then I'll come back and start another signup list here after that.
I am claiming GM and publisher perogative to be in the game.
Others from the above list that want to be in David's game, please
contact David. 
He will notify me when that game is full.
David plans to use Version 2.3 of the rules that restricts breakaways. 

<p>
2) I just have to comment on this one..... biggest card loss move of the
turn award goes to Broke Leg Meg on the TFWS team who played his 15 to 
jump into the pack lead, which only replenishes him a 3.
Had he played his 9 instead, he would have tucked in right behind that 
pack and replenished with a 20!!!
That's a loss of 17.
In a partial save of the day move, Broke helped his teammate Shane the Chain
score the big 21, tops for the turn!!!
BLACK JACK!!!
Damon and Barkin' lost the big pickup and may join Will in being dropped
from the pack.
Lastly, here's some more great press, leading with the Cracker Recap: 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(CRACKERS): Kenny plays his 13 (of course) and races to the second Sprint
finish line.

cross the second sprint line before Shakespeare crosses the
first one.  Can we drop Shakespeare now?  He's mathematically
eliminated.
<i>((No, even if he stops submitting orders, I will keep moving him.
It's in the rules that I can do that.))</i>
Kyle thinks about playing the 4 or the 12, but plays the 3 instead.
Stan thinks about playing his 7, to pull in behind Kyle, but decides
instead to play his 3, hoping to score a big card.
<i>((Yeah, I suppose that's pretty big.))</i>
Eric plays his 5, hoping also to score a big card.  He might,
however,
get another 6.  If he does this, he will get no only Zero 
Variance, but will also be the Most Predictable Rider in the Game.
<i>((Double those 6's for a 12!))</i>
There could be a big pack of riders from 58 to 51.  More likely,
from 57 to 51.   Somehow, I don't think it will happen.  
<i>((Nope, it happened... it happened... ))</i>

<p>
(STOOGES - BOOB):  Well, I definitely don't like this rule that gives the
breaking away bonus multiple times, so I'll drop that one.  I can see
the logic in a max of 15, so for the moment looks like I'm leaning towards
using Version 2.3.  Are there any other changes?  One I'm considering
adding would be to not publish the original cards.  Since everyone could
track the ones we get I'll publish them and save people the trouble, but
keep the originals secret.  I'll also go with either every other TAP 
deadlines, or do it every TAP to keep it moving.  I'm going to open it
up this time so you can get a chance to play.

<p>
(WHOEVER - FIELD): When did any British show ever look as good as the
Stooges?  I refer the honourable (sic) gentleman to the Ministry of Silly
Walks and the Fish Slapping Face Dance from Monty Python.
MY MUM loved the Stooges and hated the Marx Brothers (which always
astonished me), which blows your theory of women uniformly hating the
Stooges.  Personally I think Roscoe Arbuckle could have eaten the Stooges
for breakfast and beaten all 4 in a custard pie throwing contest.  It was
said that Arbuckle could simultaneously throw two custard pies in
different directions with uncanny accuracy, and let's face it, the
Stooges would not have the wit to duck!

<p>
(STOOGES - BOOB): Actually, I'm not really a fan of the Stooges, just
needed a name.  There are a couple of funny episodes, but I can't take
a lot of them.

<p>
(WHOEVER - FIELD): The real question is not why men like the Stooges,
but why women don't?  A roommate of mine once looked into this
question.  He asked his brother's wife what the difficulty was.
Her comment was something to the effect of ``and who's going to
clean up the mess afterwards?"

<p>
(MOE - WORLD): Someone put a stick in the rest of those Cracker's wheels,
Kenny's going to get enough points for all of them.

<p>
(BUNNIES-FIELD):  We've decided to rename our team ``Les Tortoises'' and play
our lowest cards this Turn.

<p>
(CHEF - BOOB): We can hardly answer the question ``Who killed Kenny?"
when Kenny's not dead yet, can we?  Look, see him out on the race
track?  He's zooming away, happy as a clam!

<p>
(FLOPSY-WORLD): I keep trying for that fourth seven, but it keeps eluding me!
I'm going to try some double-think this time and ditch one of my sevens.

<p>
(CHEF - FLOPSY): Good work, but you got another 6.  Better luck
this time!

<p>
(FLOPSY-BARD):  If you will just play your four, you could take the lead in
the contest for lowest standard deviation.

<p>
(TFWS - DESIGNER): As you can see, I risked it, and Damon played my song,
but no one else played along.
At least I'm starting to think like you, 'cept now all bets are off.
I'm getting left behind.

<p>
(GOZ to TFWS): Would you get UP here!!!

<p>
(BUNNIES-TFWS):  I was not trying to deceive you.  I think what happened is
that, due to the mail delay, you responded on the Turn after the one I was
requesting cooperation on.  I apologize for the confusion.

<p>
(DAMON VELODROME to PETER AND ALFRED): I think it's up to you guys.  Are you
going after Kenny or not?

<p>
(FARMER MAC-GOZ):  That's why engineers invented computers-so they don't
have to count!

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO., INC):
Profits off $3M last quarter.  A breakup of the company seems in order.  We
propose giving golden parachutes to the directors, hiring several efficiency
experts, and getting Microsoft to buy us out.

<p>
(CHEF - JOHN LOGIE-BAIRD): As you see, I can properly hyphenate your
name.  Not bad for a cook in an elementary school cafeteria, eh?
Do you find it ironic that the Stooges are seen more often on
television than, say, your teammate, William Shakespeare?

<p>
(CHRISTOPH WHEELHUB to WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE): Since you're a writer, and
apparently don't have anything better to do, how about coming up with an
ending for this script other than what appears to be in the works?

<p>
(VEGAS - TFWS): The 50:1 odds were generous.  You have no points yet
and most of your riders are in the back.  And the current ``who
gets dropped next" board only has two names on it: Barkin' Larkin
and Damon Velodrome.  Even though you have two riders who have decent
cards, they would have to use those cards just to get back into
the middle.  And being in the middle doesn't score any points.

<p>
New Vegas Odds:

<p>
<p>Winning next sprint:

<p>
(off board)

<p>
<p>Finishing in money, next sprint:

<p>
 Kenny:  (off board)

<p>
 Alfred:  1:100

<p>
 Peter:   1:50

<p>
 John Logie-Baird:  1:50

<p>
 Kyle:  2:1

<p>
 Flopsy: 4:1

<p>
 Stan:  4:1

<p>
 Jason: 6:1

<p>
 Meg:  5:1

<p>
 Shane: 6:1

<p>
 Christoph Wheelhub:  9:1

<p>
 Mopsy:  8:1

<p>
 Eric Cartman:  15:1

<p>
Odds the Stooges get 0 points this stage:
1:4  
(as in you put down $4, and get only $1 if the stooges get 0 points)
(not accepting any bets from abusive short men with bad haircuts)

<p>
<p>Winning race:

<p>
 Kenny: 1:20

<p>
 Anybody else: 10:1

<p>
<p>Winning Team:

<p>
 Chef's Crackers:  2:1

<p>
 Stooges:  5:2

<p>
 Brits:  3:1

<p>
 Anybody Else:  10:1

<p>
<p>We were rightly criticized for overstating the odds for GT &amp; Co.
Since there was no action at 4:1, we've raised the stakes.

<p>
The action on the Brits was a bit too heavy, so the line has dropped.
We still think that the Brits suffer badly in a few respects:

<p>
 1) The Stooges are 19 points ahead of them

<p>
 2) They let Kenny run away

<p>
 3) Newton's cards are not very good

<p>
 4) Shakespeare has been dropped

<p>
Even if Alfred and Logie-Baird grab #2 and #3 in this stage, the
Brits will still be behind the Stooges.  And quite probably, they
will have to blow their good cards to do so.  They will ride the entire 
last stage behind the Stooges, and with only 3 riders to the 4 riders the
other two competitive teams have.   

<p>
(SCENE 1 - UNCLE JIMBO'S GUN SHOP):

<p>
Bart Simpson walks in, walks to the counter.  As he is coming in,
two teenagers wearing long gray trenchcoats are wheeling out two
carts
filled with guns and ammo piled high.

<p>
Tough kid:  we'll come back for the rest later.

<p>
(They leave)

<p>
Jimbo:  Oh, those Littleton kids, they just love high-quality
weaponry.  

<p>
Bart:  Hi there, do you have any high-power rifles with laser scopes?

<p>
Jimbo:  We sure do.  Hey, wait a minute, are you old enough to
buy these things?

<p>
Bart:  (pulls out ID, hands to Jimbo)

<p>
Jimbo:  Hmm...Santos L.  Helper.  Born in 1953.  Well, I'm glad
to be of service, Mr. Helper.  But those Littleton kids cleaned us
right out.  But, hold on a second, I've got one weapon left.  I call
it the ``Oswald".  
(Jimbo hands a simple, old-fashioned marine rifle to Bart).

<p>
Bart:  Well, I guess that will have to do.  I've got some, um,
hunting to do.

<p>
(SCENE 2):
(end of second Sprint finish.  A huge crowd has gathered.  
A large sign states ``Kathie Lee Gifford welcoms the heroic
racers of South Park")
(Bart walks in, gun strapped to his tiny back)

<p>
Bart:  Excuse me, officer, is there somewhere I can get a good shot,
um, view of the finish line?

<p>
Officer Barbrady:  Well, the view from the Book Depository is pretty
good.

<p>
Bart:  Thanks, officer!  (walks off)

<p>
(Chef drives up)
Chef:  Officer Barbrady, we have reason to believe there's a maniac
with a rifle who wants to take a shot at the race leader!  Have
you seen anybody?

<p>
(Barbrady thinks hard.   Real hard.)

<p>
Barbrady's thoughts:  The book depository would be nice.  Depository.
Depository.  Depository.

<p>
Barbrady:  Sorry Chef, I have no idea.  Haven't seen anybody.

<p>
Chef:  Well, thanks anyway!

<p>
(SCENE 3):
(the book depository)
(Bart has a snug position by a high window)

<p>
Bart:  Die, McCormick, Die!

<p>
(Kenny appears from over the hill, blazing away as his ramjet
gains speed)

<p>
Bart:  I've got you, McCormick!

<p>
(A shot rings out.  Bart looks startled, what's this?  He hasn't
pulled the trigger yet.)

<p>
(From another window)
Mr. Garrison:  Kathie Lee, I've got you now!
(Garrison fires three more times.)

<p>
(The shots riccochet off Kathie Lee's protective glass bubble.
One hits Kenny, who promptly dies.  A security team swarms in and
carries Kathie Lee to safety.  Rats start nibbling on Kenny's corpse.
Then the Mir space station falls on him.  He is quite flat.)

<p>
Bart:  Banzai!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``My head hurts, get off, get off me;
Get off with a pile of girls; Shag pile's best; The best a man can get....''
From ``Tourettes'' on <i>Me</i> - see review above.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Well, I am back from my vacation to China, and I can only
hope to somehow find the time to do a complete report.
But in brief... it was wonderful, somewhat expensive at $300/night, full
of adventure (want some Chinese toilets stories?),
<i>((Well, I've heard them from others....))</i>
full of history, and packed with fascinating encounters with the 
Chinese people.
But just a tidbit should do here.
On my first day in China, 18 April, I walked to the Beijing Zoo
with a friend, and we had a chance to see the pandas.
Two adult pandas and two baby pandas.
I remember the excitement of the Chinese when the keeper
rolled out the two babies.
Now, I don't speak or understand a single word of Chinese, yet I bet
I can accurately translate the comments of the crowd: ``ooo, aren't they
CUTE?,
``how sweet'', ``how adorable'' etc. etc. etc. because on a cuteness scale
of 1 to 10, baby pandas are a solid 10.
In response, the baby pandas tried to roll up and go back to sleep.
The adult pandas slept all the time we were there.
Not exactly an active animal.

<p>
I should mention that everyone wore western style clothing, not a Mao
jacket to be seen during the entire trip.
<i>((They make so many of the western clothes there, why wouldn't
they decide they should wear them too????))</i>
Nor did I see a single tank, jeep, soldier, militia, or anything else
of a military nature.
Walking the streets of any city in China, even as obvious tourists,
was a heck of a lot safer than walking in any american city as far
as crime went, although you did have to watch out for pickpockets
and petty theft.
But the traffic was just awful, and crossing any street was a life
or death affair for both Chinese and tourists.

<p>
Even worse was the air pollution.
Far far worse than Los Angeles.
More like London in 1957 when I was growing up and they were just
making the transition from coal to coke.
The air of Beijing is laden with coal dust, and anybody with any
kind of breathing problem must stay away from China for the next
few years.

<p>
(SEAN-JEFF): Religion was taken out of schools because they couldn't 
discriminate against the other religions without getting nailed with freedom 
of religion. Like Voodoo with Christian or Satanic worship. Besides for my age 
group and lower it can be more deadly than for a soldier in Vietnam if you 
get targeted by a gang or member. There is no such thing as take prisoners 
on the street. There are many gangs to worry about. Folk Fallow our lord 
king satan, Blood be loyal or otherwise die, Vice Lord, Crypt former part of 
Folk, and Spurs which its ritual is gang rape not to beat you to a pulp. As 
it is you got to worry about discrimination of sex, color, and cops i.e. in a 
area I lived at one point a dead cop was worth more then heroin and now you 
want to bring religion into the fry of an already complex system of teen 
hood. Sorry, but if that ever passes I'll never send any of my kids to 
school because safety is already bad? Why make things more dangerous? 
I'm sorry, but praying for a miracle doesn't happen. This is like you and Gail 
in high school.  You didn't get messed up because you were their pitcher. 
These days the school year ends or you tick them off enough, they'll beat you up 
in school or at the end of the year when you're not a pitcher for them anymore.

<p>
(UNBELIEVING ANDRUSCHAK-JEFF O'DONNELL): It would have been nice if,
40 years ago, because of Christian prayers in school, there was no
violence in schools.
Now ask any Jewish kid from that era what it was like to be beaten up on
a regular basis because he was descended from Christ-killers''.
Jewish kids did not usually join in The Lord's Prayer, and as such became
targets.
Ask any kid with brains what it was like to be regularly beaten up by school
bullies.
Ask a lot of kids from 40 years ago what it was like to be beaten up by
school bullies.
By the way, I had NO idea that Richard Nixon was a Democrat, in spite of his
foreign policy disaster of Vietnam.
OK, I will admit that it was not Nixon's fault that Eisenhower supported the 
French in Indo-China in the 1950's.
Come to think of it, Eisenhower has good claims to be a Democrat, if you consider
his foreign policy disaster of Hungary in 1956.

<p>
(PAUL to JEFF): Don't give me this crap about prayer in schools being the
solution to teen violence.  I ceased believing in God when I was 16 years old; 
since that time,
I haven't even slapped or slugged another human being (I only struck my DOG once,
when she had a neighbor's poodle in her jaws and was about to chomp down).
     
<p>
Okay, so maybe I'm just better educated that the next; I spent my teen years
reading Gandhi instead of the Bible, and listening to John Lennon's
songs instead of
some priests' sermons.  A good dose of Anti-Vietnam War sentiment helped
to hone and mature my pacifist leanings.
     
<p>
But Jim-Bob has the point:  the fact that I had two parents united in one home for
all my formative years did a lot to teach me right from wrong.  One of them was
always there and did keep an eye on me and my brothers; to give helpful
nudges here and there when they seemed needed.
     
<p>
We were spanked as children.  That caused no lasting trauma.  We
were allowed to play with toy guns as kids; that didn't lead me (or any
of my three brothers) to favor real guns.  We never had access to
firearms in our home.  As high schoolers, we discovered how 
to make gunpowder and even built home firecrackers:  
we never threw them at one another, or used them to
damage property (okay, a few anthills were fried and/or blown to
smithereens along the way).
     
<p>
In my late teens, I was fond of Dungeons and Dragons, Lord of the
Rings, and even Conan the Barbarian.  Somehow, I never tied that crap in with real
life; I had been taught the difference between real and make believe.  It was never
that hard a lesson to learn.
     
<p>
People like yourself have to learn these truths, which can indeed
be ``self-evident."  Prayer doesn't make for solid citizens, although it is true
that some great people do pray.  Let them internalize whatever there is to learn
from it, if that is the only way for them to handle life and its complications.
     
<p>
One solution doesn't fit all, but a solid family life seemed to work well for me.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): Somebody asked about a certain incident in a past NYEED
game.
Since I was there, I can tell you what happened.
It was David Wang, and nobody else, who as Russia nuked his own four SCs/
This came to be known as the ``David Wang Lemming Offensive''.
To keep the record straight, it should be noted that David's actions
were due to a mis-reading of the rules of this variant, the sort of thing
that can happen to any player.
However, most such mis-readings do not result in such a heavy punishment.
<i>((I don't know, I never did figure out the sense of his misreading,
to any degree.
I thought he WAS trying to blow up all of his own centers, knowing it was
not going to help him win, but then just thought BECAUSE he was blowing up
all of his centers, he needn't bother moving his four units because they
were destined to blow up too.
Of course, that is wrong, nukes blow up AFTER the spring moves.
It still is quite nutty, then.))</i>

<p>
(UKRAINE -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BRITAIN): Almost as much fun as you and Spain are having.  I notice
an Egyptian fleet coming that way, think it's a coincidence that he's always
around the hot spots?

<p>
(FRANCE-ITALY): Congratulations on being the ONLY player to write me
the last few turns.
Such kindness is appreciated.

<p>
(WORFSKI, SON OF MOGHSKI to WORLD): Today is a good day to die.
We demand our legal rights of ``bortaS DIB" (Klingon Way pg 121)

<p>
(P-U OR PEW): It was all my fault, I know I attacked the wrong one.
Best of luck.

<p>
(TONIGHT ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL!): The inside story on World Championship
Wrestling's new line of colognes for men.
They actually don't smell like anything, you just pretend they stink.
Followed by <i>National Geographic</i>'s ``Stark Naked Fat Guys at the Beach''
and ``Wildflowers of the Antarctic''!
(We got there, there weren't any, but we made a show about it anyway.)

<p>
(G to S AND B): Hey, if you guys don't WANT Mor, you could combine to
convoy one of our armies there.  We'd take it....

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): First it was three weeks in Turkey.
Then two weeks sailing the Caribbean.
Then three weeks in China.
Not only has all this globe trotting caused me to neglect this game
of Modern Diplomacy, it has caused me to neglect GM abuse.
You may, of course, omit the following example if you feel that
it is not appropriate for your szine, or that most of the <i>TAP</i>
readership has never read Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>.
<i>((Oh, no, I wouldn't miss this for the world....))</i>

<p>
(KENT OF CORNWALL-GM): Thou art a knave, a rascal, an eater of broken
meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred pound,
filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily livered, action-taking knave;
a whoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
a one-trunk inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
good service, art nothing but composition of a knave, a begger, coward,
pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat
into a clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy
addition.

<p>
(COACH G to STUDENT P): No, no-you don't oversupport an attack on ONE
center, and just ignore three others.  
That is very costly.  And you don't order
your supports from positions where they are most likely to be cut.
Cutting supports leads directly
to cutting throats:  I know that.

<p>
(POLAND-WORLD): Attack Germany and end the rise of the fourth reich before
it gets out of control.

<p>
(P-S): Damn Brits betrayed our ambassadors and probably deserve to pay too,
but Germans deserve it more.

<p>
(ASSOCIATED PRESS BERLIN): Bitter Poles decry the ``coming ethnic
cleansing" of their homeland, at the hands of the Greater German Reich.
Babies.  They cite as evidence recent remodelling of Polish trenches
between Lithuania and Latvia, now
replete with shag carpets and halogen lighting, as being ``nothing
strong hints that the Poles are expected to crawl to Moscow and
StPetersburg like animals."  The Greater Reichministry scornfully
retorted:  ``They are getting more than they deserve.  We are allowing
them all Winter to gather their belongings and begin
to move out.  Permanently.  Any Poles still found in the regions of
Lithuania and
Bielorussia this coming Spring will be summarily executed.  Bottom
line."

<p>
(FRANCONIA to BARCELONA): How are your shipyards going to have room to
operate in the future, if your coastal regions are still occupied by
useless land troops?

<p>
(DAVE - ERIC): It's not the triple flip, it's the double twist that keeps it
interesting.  I think we need to get you an ``Ally of the day" board so
we can keep it straight.

<p>
(SPAIN): Who's with me?

<p>
(BRITAIN-SPAIN): Fight the good fight, m'man.
And while you're at it, look up Patrick Henry.

<p>
(???):
Polish ambassadors were again confused at the rantings of Premier
Roland.  Apparently his grip on reality has slipped to the point 
where he's communicating with spirits from other dimensions.  
``We're real confused," said one ambassador, who wished that his
name would be withheld, ``he's talking about how Poland is falling,
but he keeps blaming some `Desper' guy.  To our knowledge,
there is no `Desper' currently involved in European politics. 
We nod and agree, but the court psychiatrist has recommended a heavy
dosage of  Thorazine.  While we are not confident of a full recovery,
we think that, at the least, the frequency of the embarrassing
incidents with the interns (and their pets!) should diminish."

<p>
In related news, Berlitz announced that German classes were being
offered in all the major cities of the Country Formerly Known as
Poland.  Early registration figures are strong, and attendance is
expected to be quite high.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The BFJHR draw is rejected. 
It also is reproposed.
Please vote with your Summer orders.
Failure to vote (or to re-vote, unless you specifically state that your pro-vote
is to remain in effect) vetoes the proposal.

<p>
2) Note that Luke has moved to his summer address.

<p>
3) Lots of blood in retreats and annihilations this time.
If I were you, I'd check my adjudication here.
I think I got everything right, but speeding by it in my head, it's always
possible I'll miss something.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HOLLAND): The Dutch government announces its support of the 
Double Secret Russian Peace Accords.  To signal its support, the
Dutch have ordered the bombing of the Chinese embassy in 
Annam.  

<p>
(RUSSIA to WORLD): Can't we all just get along?

<p>
(INFOMERCIAL): Are you sick of British Fleets and armies running amok in
your country? Are you also wary of those Dutch who convinced you they
were those Pennslvanian kind that did not like war? Well, we got a great
new product for you direct from French Colonial Cologne Factories!  We
guarantee that this product is not made by any child under 12! We also
guarantee that Kathy Lee was fired from our operation and now works for
the Dutch. Yes, folks our new Napoleon Bonaparte line of scents will
drive away any foul smelling foreign menace in no time at all. Call or
Email for some today. Not available in Moscow, Elba, or Waterloo flavors.

<p>
(AMSTERDAM - ARCHANGEL):  British victory?  You been rolling in
the poppy fields too much?  We've got Russian forces from Syria to
Chungking and I'm supposed to worry about Britain?

<p>
(BOOB to AMSTERDAM): Yes, what about Russia, what about Russia??

<p>
(RUSSIA to GM): You stay out of this... I'm surprised you can even GM
this.

<p>
(BOOB to USELESS DUCK): Hey, me too!
I don't have the board memorized quite well enough yet.

<p>
(JAKARTA - TOKYO): I hope you are looking at the same board I am.
Those R's don't stand for Rick.

<p>
(TSAR to BOOB): Can I be full now?

<p>
(BORNEO - PARIS): I thought I explained that I didn't do this for
shits and giggles.  Oh well, you must think what you must think.
Or something like that.  Go fight Russia!  

<p>
(TSAR to PROVIDENCE): Are we there yet?

<p>
(BOOB to WADDLING DUCK): No, you slow poke!
Why don't you watch how the Dutch do it!!

<p>
(JAVA - GM): I trade in grain, sheep, and ore for a development card,
please.  

<p>
(ODESSA to SULTAN): Surprised?
Your English buddy is slowly moving in.

<p>
(T to R): Read your press???  I have to look there for your diplomacy?  I
tend to glance right over it.  Or if I make eye/brain contact I have to slow
my metabolism to the point where I can digest it and then take a long nap.
Afterwards I shed my skin and move on.

<p>
(Niederl&#228;nder - ENTE): Do you know your secret name?

<p>
(ME to YOU): I wonder if my harsh press clip was discovered? 

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): So, are we friends yet?

<p>
(F-H): I know how to put a little excitement back into this one!

<p>
(PRESIDENT REAGAN - ASSEMBLED COLONIAL POWERS): We're voting ``yes"
on the draw to prove

<p>
1) We don't <i>really</i> hate Roland, we just like picking on him.

<p>
2) The Tsar is going to veto the draw any ol' how.  Probably Turkey
will also.

<p>
(OMSK to KYOTO): Madness takes its toll.
Shall we end the bloody war?
Don't you have a new target picked out yet?

<p>
(F-W): Cologne factory producing over time and we still can not rid the
world of the stench of Elderberrys. 

<p>
(RADIO FREE BUDDAH): Bangkok oriental setting and the city don't know what
the city is getting. Looks like a British attack.

<p>
(F-B): The French embassy joyously celebrates the first reply to a
multitude of missives to the usurper on the British throne.  We learned
the valuable history lesson that history is full of new governments
which did not live up to the treaties of the previous government. Gee
thanks?

<p>
(F-R&amp;J):  Beati Pacific.

<p>
(MOSCOW to TOKYO): At this writing, I have not heard from you.
Would you tell me again, just what did I do to you to earn this
terrible treatment?

<p>
(SKYWALKER to ALL): I apologize about the lack of communication.  My life has
been a tad hectic lately, but should
improve along with my communications.

<p>
(NOTE to DOOM SCOREKEEPER FROM MOI): I am not a press slug, also are you
trying to tell me I go both ways with that arrow <font face=symbol>�</font

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A German concession is proposed along with FG, FGT, and FGAT draws.
Please vote with your Fall orders.
You guys know the routine by now.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY-GERMANY): You made a brilliant move.  Not what I would have done, 
but brilliant enough to guarantee yourself a victory.  I propose and am 
voting for a concession to you.  I doubt you will vote for it though.  I bet 
you think there is a difference between a ``win" and a ``concession."
	
<p>
(TURKEY - AUSTRIA): Thanks for the fun. Sorry we couldn't get you to equal 
France at the end.  However, the longest single center survival is quite an 
accomplishment.  Please tell me when you can come to SF and I will arrange a 
game of your choice. I Know Maniac.
	
<p>
(TURKEY - FRANCE): I only picked on you to goad you, hoping that you would 
extend the life of this game so that I would continue to get the zine 
without having to pay.  I am unemployed now and would have appreciated the 
financial support.  Seriously, I'm sure you are ticked off at me for earlier 
press, and my press didn't help me in the long run, but, I laud your 
perseverence and determination.  Congratulations on a game well-played.  One 
more little goad though, doesn't it feel strange to be happy with having 
gone from a dominant position to only two SC's just to end the game?

<p>
(FRA-GM): I will REALLY be glad when Germany wins this game!

<p>
(RICHARD-JIM): As you well know, I only voted for a draw once, and the rest 
of the time, did vote for some 4-ways.  As you well know, I had a great time 
writing black press.  As you well know, I love the hell out of <i>TAP</i> and your 
GM'ing.  I am serious however, I am not planning on entering another game of 
Dip ever and this is the last game that I am in.  I thank you for this 
stand-bye position.  I thank each of the players in the game for what has 
been one of the most interesting games I've played in in any szine (counting 
in the three figures of games played).  I have developed a fondness for 
Germany and Austria during this game - and that is what the hobby is all 
about.  Friendship and fun.  Enjoy all.

<p>
(BOOB to CHILLERS): It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings, and she ain't sung yet!!
Tune in next time, same Bat time, same Bat channel!!
