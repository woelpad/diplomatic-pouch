<br /><br />We've got more from Peter Sullivan, <i>Tinamou</i> and 
<i>Michael Lowrey's szine</i> in here as well,
chock full of subszines as the "school year" (for those of us that are
on that kind of schedule) returns.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just want to add my hopes and prayers to those of everyone else for the
people affected by the disaster in Mississippi and especially in New 
Orleans.
As a many, many time visitor to New Orleans who likes the city at that
gut level that it seems to affect so many people, I hope it can be put
back together.
I will add to the many notes of caution that I hope that it is not
rebuilt piecemeal, but with some sort of detailed plan that is devised
as separated from politics as possible.
Recent events do not suggest that this will happen, but I still hope and
pray for it.
One of my favorite all-time politicians, Bruce Babbitt, who in a kinder,
gentler world would have served two terms as our President at some point,
is probably about where I am about how and where such a detailed plan 
would come out.
It would explicitly consider the likelihood of the rising ocean water
levels from global warming that will cause these sorts of floods and
rebuilds to be much more common in the second half of this century.
It would likely NOT rebuild some areas to make them back into 
shock absorbing brackish marshes.
It would do as Chicago, Seattle, and Galveston among others have done in
the past when faced with these problems, it would jack the whole city
up X number of feet, fill in underneath and end up with a city a good
deal higher than it is today.
This is not rocket science, it is common sense, which is in short
supply when there is short term thinking and political meandering
going on.
Heaven help us against the Chinese who are not bothered by such limitations
and are already planning for the NEXT century when they will dominate the
world.
I've got a little exchange with Robert Lesco down below on North Korea and China.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Late update, I wanted to get <i>Tinamou</i> in here and with Terry Tallman's
illness and verification of the delay in Spirals of Paranoia it took a bit
of time to close this issue up.
I moved the deadlines back a week to compensate.
Also, be aware that the whole Diplomatic Pouch website, including where
the web version of the szine is housed is doing a server migration 
(THANKS to Millis Miller for keeping this all up, you need to remember
him in your thoughts and prayers.....)
so the web version of the szine could periodically be unavailable for
times in the next few weeks.
Just try again and don't worry too much.
If you're just seeing this by E-Mail and need access, you might want to 
save the szine so you can be sure to get to it.

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.

Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue

Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date was now a "whenever".
But Peter is now clearly back, as he appears for his second issue in a row!!!
See <i>Octopus' Garden 55</i> in the print edition below, or on the web
at the above address.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge have been picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.
Rip has been traveling this summer also, but he is trying to get his act back

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR KEVIN TIGHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a very special "search for" coming up in issue #300, and I'm
going to offer a hundred buck reward for that one, so I'm also going to 
up the ante on Kevin through issue #300 to $1 billion dollars.... no,
make that $100, can't quite afford to be THAT generous.
There have been some recent "sightings" of Kevin Tighe.
And he's the reason I first started this feature (for those of you who
don't recall) and he's the one I continue to be most interested in finding.
This may take a bit of real detective work, but as a hint, like many of
us Diplomacy players, I believe he is out there making money on some
of the poker circuits.
I also would like ALL of the previous found people who are still getting
the szine to write me SOMETHING for the 300th issue for this section.
I know I've been having Doug Beyerlein write me lots of little notes
along the way, not all of whom I've been printing, and so I have some
things from him already.
But he may want to send me something else.
What should you write?
Something on what you've been up to, a reminiscence of Diplomacy times
or friends past, whatever, it's up to you, but I want something from
as many of you as possible.
While we're at it, some of you other old timers still getting the
szine (you know who you are, but I'm thinking most particularly of
people like Tom Nash, Dan Stafford, Bruce Geryk, and Steve Hutton,
most of whom were once szine editors) also should write me something!!!
I plan to have issue #300 be the first issue of 2006, so you have the
rest of the year.
I'll save them up for that issue, but get writing now!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au

Hi Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>TAP</i> 294 just arrived, which reminds me of a recent question
I had that your readership might be able to address.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the gym I force myself to visit, one background song they play
is a silly song about "Come Back to Texas", a lament by some
guy who lost his love to "a guy named Leland, from Cleveland,
she met at the bank."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With all that music stuff I've seen in <i>TAP</i> (but never read)
I'm sure someone knows (or knows where to find)
the <b>words to the song</b>.
It's pretty funny, but much is indecipherable.
"She went to make a deposit, she cleaned out her closet, and went away."
The `come-back-to-Texas' part is repeated - can't think of the
musical term for that - <i>((Refrain... or chorus))</i>
and one verse includes the appeal that "you don't suck as bad
as the Mexican food."
I'm sure someone recognizes it.
<i>((Indeed, I do, the group is called Bowling for Soup
and they are known for these very bad rhymes.
They also rhyme Texas with breast-es in one song.
Funny that they're played in an exercise place
as they're all about fun and drinking beer.))</i>

January 30, 2003, United States v. Reid -— Final Statements by Judge Young 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Mr. Richard C. Reid, hearken now to the sentence the Court imposes upon you. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On counts 1, 5 and 6 the Court sentences you to life in prison in 
the custody of the United States Attorney General. 
On counts 2, 3, 4 and 7, the Court sentences you to 20 years in prison on 
each count, the sentence on each count to run consecutive one with the 
other. That's 80 years. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On Count 8 the Court sentences you to the mandatory 30 years consecutive 
to the 80 years just imposed. The Court imposes upon you on each of the 
eight counts a fine of $250,000 for the aggregate fine of $2 million. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Court accepts the government's recommendation with respect 
to restitution and orders restitution in the amount of $298.17 to 
Andre Bousquet and $5,784 to American Airlines. 
The Court imposes upon you the $800 special assessment. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Court imposes upon you five years supervised release simply 
because the law requires it. But the life sentences are real life 
sentences so I need not go any further. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the sentence that is provided for by our statutes. 
It is a fair and a just sentence. It is a righteous sentence. 
Let me explain this to you. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We are not afraid of any of your terrorist co-conspirators, Mr. Reid. 
We are Americans. We have been through the fire before. 
There is all too much war talk here. 
And I say that to everyone with the utmost respect. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here in this court where we deal with individuals as individuals, 
and care for individuals as individuals, as human beings we reach out for justice. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You are not an enemy combatant. You are a terrorist. You are not 
a soldier in any war. You are a terrorist. To give you that reference, 
to call you a soldier gives you far too much stature. 
Whether it is the officers of government who do it or your 
attorney who does it, or that happens to be your view, you are a terrorist. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And we do not negotiate with terrorists. We do not treat with terrorists. 
We do not sign documents with terrorists. 
We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So war talk is way out of line in this court. You're a big fellow. 
But you're not that big. You're no warrior. I know warriors. 
You are a terrorist. A species of criminal guilty of multiple attempted murders. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In a very real sense Trooper Santiago had it right when first 
you were taken off that plane and into custody and you wondered 
where the press and where the TV crews were and you said you're 
no big deal. You're no big deal. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What your counsel, what your able counsel and what the equally 
able United States attorneys have grappled with and what I have 
as honestly as I know how tried to grapple with, is why you did 
something so horrific. What was it that led you here to this 
courtroom today? I have listened respectfully to what you have to say. 
And I ask you to search your heart and ask yourself what sort 
of unfathomable hate led you to do what you are guilty and 
admit you are guilty of doing. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And I have an answer for you. It may not satisfy you. 
But as I search this entire record it comes as close to understanding as I know. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It seems to me you hate the one thing that to us is most precious. 
You hate our freedom. Our individual freedom. Our individual freedom 
to live as we choose, to come and go as we choose, to believe or not 
believe as we individually choose. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here, in this society, the very winds carry freedom. 
They carry it everywhere from sea to shining sea. 
It is because we prize individual freedom so much that 
you are here in this beautiful courtroom. So that everyone can see, 
truly see that justice is administered fairly, individually, and discretely. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is for freedom's sake that your lawyers are striving so vigorously 
on your behalf and have filed appeals, will go on in their representation 
of you before other judges. We care about it. 
Because we all know that the way we treat you, Mr. Reid, 
is the measure of our own liberties. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Make no mistake though. It is yet true that we will bear 
any burden; pay any price, to preserve our freedoms. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Look around this courtroom. Mark it well. The world is not 
going to long remember what you or I say here. 
Day after tomorrow it will be forgotten. 
But this, however, will long endure. 
Here, in this courtroom, and courtrooms all across America, 
the American people will gather to see that justice, 
individual justice, justice, not war, individual justice 
is in fact being done. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The very President of the United States through his officers 
will have to come into courtrooms and lay out evidence on 
which specific matters can be judged, and juries of citizens 
will gather to sit and judge that evidence democratically, 
to mold and shape and refine our sense of justice. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See that flag, Mr. Reid? That's the flag of the United States of America. 
That flag will fly there long after this is all forgotten. 
That flag still stands for freedom. You know it always will. 
Custody, Mr. Officer. Stand him down." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, how much of this Judge's comments did we hear on our TV sets? 
We need more judges like Judge Young, but that's another subject. Pass 
this around. Everyone should and needs to hear what 
this fine judge had to say. 
Powerful words that strike home. 
God bless America. 
Please forward this---so that every American has a chance to read it.

"North Korea To Scrap Nuclear Program"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So reads the headline in front of me which may be a
more satisfactory explanation of why North Korea
doesn't get invaded then that supplied by your
correspondant of a couple of issues ago.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That and the fact that, no matter how much you hate
President Bush, North Korea still shares a border with
China and is very much within what is considered their
sphere of interest.  All of which prompts some to
comment that if North Korea is misbehaving, China is
partly to blame.

I agree with you there.  There seems an awful lot of
thought going into the concept of a post-Kim Il Jung
(forgive my spelling if need be)
<i>(( Did you mean father Kim Il Sung or son Kim Jong Il,
you sort of combined them.... which isn't a bad idea.))</i>
 N. Korea although
that may or may not be particularly long-term if
rumours are to be believed.  Just a while back there
was an official announcement condemning, among other
things, decadent Western hair-styles which leads one
to wonder how long Mr. Bouffant is going to last.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just the same, as with Libya, the practice is first
you give up your weapons programs, then the rewards

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's come to that, has it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What I said a few months back still holds, I think.  The Sox need
Schilling and Foulke to pitch <b>well</b> to make another World Series
run.  That they've made it this far without them is surprising...but
Matt Clement is not Curt Schilling, as we saw yesterday.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The big surprise is how much ground the Indians have gained on the
White Sox.  But Chicago has taken swan dives in other years, so I
guess that's not a huge surprise.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's pretty simple: if the Sox play well, they're in.  If they don't,
they're not.  OK, it's not that simple - life would be easier if the
Yankees didn't have another 6 game winning streak.  But the rest of
the season consists of games at Fenway, Baltimore, and Tampa Bay so
things certainly could be worse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It'll probably come down to the last weekend.

<i>((Oh ye of little faith..... I remember after Game 3 of the Yankees
series last year when ***I*** had not yet given up....
I actually saw a number of good signs in the last week.  First
off, Keith Foulke came in and pitched two good innings.  Timlin
is doing great in classic one inning save situations (actually
better than in his setup situations), Wakefield and Arroyo are
pitching well, and Wells is battling.  Schilling is still a week
before the season opens in Spring Training and his last start was
the dreaded "dead arm" start where he lost 5 mph off his fast ball.
And as for Clement (which presumably was why you wrote that),
he's pitching like Lowe was last year in Sept. and you all remember
how THAT worked out.  So, right now, Clement is the one in Long
Relief with the other four as the starters.  Then you have 
Papelbon and Foulke setting up Timlin to close in the bullpen.
I'll take that.
And, sorry Goz, but I think it is the White Sox that will miss
the playoffs, with Cleveland, Boston, and New York in (if you
ask me today).  The next three days will tell a lot about that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Mon, 19 Sep 2005 16:24:22 -0700 (PDT)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Yankees, Red Sox, and Indians <b>all</b> pass the White Sox?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Seems unlikely to me.  The Yankees are 5 games back with only 14 to
play, and three of those games are against the Red Sox!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yes, I know it's mathematically possible.  But it still seems
unlikely.
If they go merely 5-9, they'd finish with 95 wins and 67 losses. 
Boston and Cleveland would have to go 8-5, and New York would have to
go 10-4 to match that mark.  Probably at least one of the three won't
catch up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the Indians sweep them, it might happen.  If they don't, I'd say
the White Sox are probably in, even if they only have a 2.5 game lead
on the Indians at that point.

<i>((That's what I'm predicting, time to head home and see if in the
car I'm started to be proven right.  It does start with the
Indians sweeping the White Sox to end up 1/2 game behind and
all the momentum, so I'm saying they'll only win about 4 games
the rest of the season to finish with 94 wins.  The other
three teams all get to 95 or better.  Hey, it's a prediction,
something for Goz to make fun of me on if I'm wrong.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Mon, 19 Sep 2005 21:59:57 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Man, I don't check my email for a day and a whole hot-stove league breaks 
out.  Let's see...Jim-Bob is predicting the following:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 A.  ChiSox go 4-10 or worse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 B.  Cleveland goes 7-6 or better.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 C.  Boston goes 7-6 or better.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 D.  New York goes 9-5 or better.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ChiSox lose all tie-breaks or playoffs.
If I had my CRC I could probably figure out the probabilities of such 
things, but it's at work right now (or maybe buried from the last 
move...hmmm).  But I can make a guess that p(A) is about .2, p(B) is about .6, 
p(C) is about .6 and p(D) is about .4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This means that p(All) is about .03, or about a 3% chance that Jim-Bob is correct. 
Sadly, Jim-Bob is not a betting man, or I'd have made a lot of money off of 
him over the years.  But it does indicate why he's gotten his WS pick right 
2 of the last 86 years.
<i>((True, but I get there with different probabilities.
I think p(A) is closer to .6, p(B) is a near certainty, p(C) is about .9,
and p(D) is about .75 even if I go for a worst case scenario.
That brings p(All) to 40%, at best case the last three are ALL near certainties
and p(A) is about .8, doubling the chances to 80%.  
My most likely scenario is a 60% chance of being right, which being above
50% allows me (in my predictive world) to make the prediction.
I might be wrong, but I still think I'm right....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But to get back to the original point, why not Ortiz at pitcher?  It's not 
like he's doing anything else during the other teams' at-bat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd meant to email you guys the week before Labor Day, as the Cubs were in 
the midst of another 8-game losing streak, and I could brag that my team was 
already out, while you guys all had to wait until 10-20 October to have your 
hearts torn out.  Neener, neener.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"But wait", I hear you cry, "you're in the Chicago area now, aren't you a 
White Sox fan too?  Can't you get your heart torn out there in October?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually, no.  The older I get the more I realize that the White Sox, and 
their fans, are just anti-Cubs instead of their own identity (I suspect the 
same is true for Mets fans with the Yankees across town, but don't know for 
sure...anyone?).  It's tough for me to cheer for something like that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the other hand, I do see bad things happening if the White Sox fold 
completely.  Some misguided Cubs' fan will reach across the divide and offer 
condolences and a hug (wouldn't happen the other way around) as sympathy for 
the collapse, and the shooting would start.  That's the last thing this town needs.

I'm not sure if people have moved or whatever in that time, so a little help would

And I hope everyone comes back, but I might need some standbys.
I am STILL not hearing from too many of you!!!

<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England), 
John Power (Germany), Tim Snyder (Italy), and Fred Wiedemeyer (Russia)
are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.
Paul Risner probably is not going to be able to continue in the game.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The proposal to change the name of the game to Spiralling Pancakes fails.
One person <i><b>HIGHLIGHTED</b></i> the game name in their orders and that's
more than enough for me.
This game is FULL of paranoia.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The proposal for the six way TAG IRE draw that would have
blamed everything that happened in this game on the Irish fails also. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Buddy, is this your current postal address?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) The delay is because Terry Tallman just came back from two weeks in
the hospital.
He thankfully is doing better and our prayers and best wishes are for
him continuing to feel better!
But given that, and his failure to have an opportunity to communicate
with the new player, I have delayed the game to next issue.
Most of the press fit as Pre-Spring, I hope I've dealt with that
as you would have wanted me to.
Write more for next time!!!
Reminder that all press in <i>TAP</i> is black so can be to anyone
from anyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-FRED): Go Canada!  Hockey is back and Edmonton vs. Calgary will be back
on every week!
I'm serious, I don't watch much basketball, so last winter sucked and the 
Blackhawks weren't exactly riveting in 2003.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MATT): Do you mean the Blackhawks weren't riveting LAST
winter (understandable because they didn't play), or that you also
expect them not to be riveting THIS winter??  There was so much
player movement that I don't have a good sense yet of who is going
to be good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT): My Blackhawks memory is from 2003 when they were very much less than riveting.
I make no predictions about this year.  Too much time and players passed.  
I am happy with the Khabibulin signing.  We should be in most games at least.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY to WORLD): I understand that there is a long standing tradition of 
attacking standbys whenever they enter a game.
I just want to go on record saying that I strongly disagree with that policy!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to MARVIN BAKER): 3 armies and 1 fleet for Italy!
Thanks a lot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): Actually, I am a STRONG proponent of the Toby Harris
school of playing Italy which says that Italy wins by being a LAND
power, not a sea power.
Good luck, and thanks for entering the game on short notice!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to THE WORLD): The translation device crackled to life, 
"Death to the Russians!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT'S WAFFLEWORKS-TERRY): Bernie loves me...why are you such a stranger?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MATT): It turns out that he had a REALLY, REALLY good excuse,
see above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to PAUL): Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SOCIETY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH LINGUISTICS-Buddy): What part of "I must build
two armies" is ambiguous?  I'm hard pressed to say this is only a clever use 
of language.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BUDDY to FRED): I have to tell you!
That Irish Sea looks so tempting!...

7 of 9's log - "Confused".
I'm not sure where I am.
I can clearly see that I am on a galaxy class starship Enterprise, but according 
to my uniform and log I'm the first officer.
One minute I'm a transformed Ferengi trying to restore the Federation
with a modified Genesis torpedo and the next thing I know I'm in 
what has to be another dimension or an alternate reality.
And I'm the #1 of the Federation flagship.
At least I'm back in human form.
I'll check today's com pic report to see where I am and 
who the local alien groups are in this reality.
So far the only transmission I've been able to analyze is
completely not understandable, even with the universal translator.
I can only conclude that they are the "Children of Tomari", 
the alien group that can only communicate with metaphors
and not understandable gibberish.
It will be interesting to see if they have any intention of
real communication.
<i>((Very interesting, indeed.
Do we wonder who 7 of 9 might be talking about..... nah.... we know!))</i>
(7, not sure what to do or who to confide in, goes down to sickbay
and tells her story to the Holo Doctor.
After about 1/2 an hour, the Holo Doctor looks at 7 and says, "so we 
don't even know who our shipmates are or how we got here?"
At that moment, something happened that put 7 of 9 into complete shock.
The captain of the Enterprise walked in.
7 recognized him from her knowledge of history, she did not know him.
He did not know here or the Doctor or how they all got here.
The Captain looked at her and said, "I have no idea who you people are!
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Christopher Pike!"
(bad dramatic Star Trek music!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A conversation, later that day between Captain Pike (P) and 7 of 9 (7):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7 - I've analyzed our tactical situation (7 explains the sequence of 
events that brought her here to this universe).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P - So let me get this straight.
You started out in our universe, 75 years into the future of my time.
You get duplicated and flipped into a perpendicular universe and
discover that our universe is no longer, and apparently never existed.
Then you change the perpendicular universe into our original universe
but somehow in the process you get spiraled into this universe, whatever
this is called, and somehow I get duplicated or transported here along with
the Holo Doctor and whoever else is on board?
<i>((I hope someone has a detailed map of all this.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7 - That pretty much explains it, but it gets worse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P - What do you mean?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7 - Our tactical situation does not look good.
We only have the Enterprise and three troop transports to defend Earth,
Mars, Vulcan, and Deep Space 1.
The Children of Tomari are in position and we are ripe for invasion.
I was able to recognize communiques from the Cardassian and Ferengi
leaders who are also from other realities.
The problem is that Captain Kirk attacked the Ferengi leader in that
reality.
They may not want to help us.
On top of that, our troops are not placed very well and one of our
troops is dangerously close to the Cardassian border.
The thing is, we could have used those resources to build another 
starship.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P - At least we are not at war yet!....

("TRANSFORMATION" PART ONE):
Captain's Log - Great news/bad news.
It worked!
And I have no joy.
7 of 9s mission was successful.
Our universe has been restored.
We are no longer Ferengi.
No one in this universe has any knowledge of the transformation.
However, the cost was steep.
As expected, the Romulans attacked and we used 
their disruptor fire as a catalyst for the
Genesis Device that 7 of 9 operated.
The problem is the mission allowed the Romulans
to walk into one of our starbases and worse than that,
7 of 9 is missing.
(As Kirk (K) is talking, Spock (S) enters his room)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Report!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I think 7 is still alive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What do you mean?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Our tricorder readings indicated a dimensional shift of
temporal energy at 7 of 9s impact point.
I don't think she's dead.
I think she has been transported to another reality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Well, I hope she's OK.
Have you analyzed the Romulan invasion?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - They are moving extremely cautiously.
They could have attacked us on two fronts.
They only moved on one.
In any event, our surrender is just a matter of time.
<i>((Perhaps I, the Supreme Being, helped to get 7 of 9
out just in time.... but then again, you know how Supreme
Beings get when you pull a Hunter S. on them.... checking
out before one's time, so get back in there.... we are
omniscient, we are omniscient.))</i>

1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Do you guys all realize that this game has been going on now for almost
SEVEN years???
Quite an accomplishment and it may not be over yet.
