<br /><br />Right up front, let's get it straight, the Mekons have a new record out that's
really a new look at their beginnings in the late 1970's.
It's called <i>Punk Rock</i>, and the Mekons were right up there with the Sex Pistols,
the Au Pairs, and the Gang of Four at its beginnings.
In fact, back when they were just an idea and didn't know how to play they
used to tour with the Gang of Four and borrow their instruments to go on
stage.
I picked up on the Mekons at the very end of that purely punk period, about
1981 or so, just around the time they began to learn how to play their 
instruments.
Some of those early songs have a lot to say and it says a lot about the
band that they've continued to play around with them and put them out 
in today's sterile music environment that desperately needs something
like punk's energy and philosophy, something that's always been the
essence of the Mekons.
I don't have <i>Punk Rock</i> yet, but I've heard some samples and I know 
a lot of the songs from the original.
I'm looking forward to this incredibly.
You won't, but I will.
This is still the greatest rock and roll band in the world, incredibly
intriguing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />I'm not sure which subszines will make it in here.  I know we have
Michael Lowrey back, which is good, I always like Michael's editorials.
Look inside and see what else made it in time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

David Wang still has the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has potential openings, you can start RIGHT NOW to play this year!
We're in Spring Training now, even though Dicko (Martin)
is still boycotting it as irrelevant.
I got myself TORCHED in free agency and my team is pretty well decimated
in hitting for average and power.
I'll be lucky if I hit 100 homers and bat .240.
Oh well, tank and wait for next year....
but then, I went 9-3 in the early spring games and some of those guys
I picked up are really hitting, could I make a comeback?
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR STEVE HEINOWSKI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>LOTS</i> of people have contacted Steve,
but he hasn't contacted ME yet....
You have until issue #280 to find him for the fifty buck prize.
That's just two more weeks!
This makes TWO missing ex-Boardman Number Custodians that we're
trying to find.
The key to this is you need to get him to write me a letter (or
send me an E-Mail, contrary to my belief, he might have an
E-Mail address...).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

We are back, Tim Haffey has agreed to be the Production Editor that I needed.
We already have a pretty decent issue put together, but we always need more articles,
either before the deadline for the next issue, which is March 1, 2004 for Issue #89; 
or afterward for Issue #90 or so on, we're going to try to achieve the quarterly
operation that we haven't been able to do in recent years!
If first impressions are anything, Tim Haffey is going to be an EXCELLENT nudge
to keep things going!
We WILL come out on time, we're all set for that.
John Coffin and David Hertzman have taken over <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> as
editors and I look forward to some nice friendly competition.
<i>The Pouch</i> will continue to be entirely a Web Szine, primarily oriented
toward the Judge hobby, preferring submissions in html (or plain text).
<i>Diplomacy World</i> will continue to format itself into more of a "complete
package" that can be printed, allowing submissions in any computer generated
format, or even in text.
We are going to be using a new technology under Tim in something called "ebook",
we'll hear more about that as we get going, but <i>Diplomacy World</i> I hope
will thrive along with <i>the Pouch</i>.
Help us out, write an article!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I'd be interested in hearing any Hobby Award Nominations for:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

 A 2004 Kathy Byrne Caruso Award for Lifetime Achievement (if warranted).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The award ballot for this year will be publicized first in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #89,

its four times a year publication schedule as a Web zine 
(www.diplomacyworld.org) and is available as a postal zine: 
cost $3 per issue in North America, <i>$</i>2 per issue in the UK 
and <i>$</i>3 per issue in the rest of the world.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tim Haffey will join Jim Burgess as an editor.  Stephen Agar
will continue to do upkeep on the Web site.  Note all E-Mails
below are in the spam friendly format "person of site.com"
where that translates into person@site.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
North American postal subs should be sent to David Partridge, 
15 Woodland Drive, Brookline, NH 03033, USA.
Email: rebhuhn of rocketmail.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rest of World postal subs should be sent to Stephen Agar, 4 Cedars 
Gardens, Brighton, UNITED KINGDOM  BN1 6YD
Email: stephen of stephenagar.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Contributions for the next issue should be sent to Tim Haffey 
by 1st March 2004: trhaffey of aol.com or Timothy R. Haffey, Sr., 
810 53rd Ave., Oakland, CA 94601 USA. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tim is going to be formatting the issues in the "Industry 
Standard" ebook format (for one example see www.openebook.org) and this is
a major contribution that maintains Diplomacy World as a bridge
between all of the Diplomacy Hobby mediums, since it will be
easily available on the web and by post.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I (Jim Burgess) will continue to co-edit and contribute the popular
Diplomacy World Interviews (I've already interviewed such luminaries
as Richard Sharp, Edi Birsan, and Brandon Clarke).  I am currently
seeking a "quick turnaround" interview candidate for the next issue,
Number 89, who can get me a paragraph Diplomacy bio in the next
week or so.  Please ask me (burgess of world.std.com) if you have
any questions or want to volunteer to be interviewed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also would like volunteers for the next Diplomacy World Demo
Game.  The last demo game (recount, using the Modern Diplomacy
variant) never was properly written up here in DW.  I hope we
can get that in the Pouch Showcase section and a write-up here
in good time.  Rick Desper (previous DW Demo Game GM and recount
GM, rick_desper of yahoo.com), Tim Haffey, and myself will consider
those requests and make a Demo Game determination of GM, location,
and Variant (if any) to be announced in Issue Number 89.  Also,
any of the participants in recount who would like to contribute
to an article or articles on this game, should contact me or Rick.
I have all of your E-Mailed endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other articles of all types are welcome (we already have four articles
in hand, so we're in good shape for the return issue):  historical
articles, convention write-ups and descriptions, strategy or tactics
articles, personality profiles, descriptions of gaming environments,
or anything else you can think of.  If you aren't sure if it works,
ask one of us.

And last, but not least, I wish John Coffin and David Hertzman
the best of luck as they take on their new challenge of following
up Manus Hand and Edward Hawthorne as editors of The Diplomatic
Pouch.  I fervently believe that having both DW and the Pouch
active and vibrant creates better writing and better things for
all of us in the hobby.  I intentionally waited with this 
announcement until they hit the ground with two weeks running.
But 2004 should be a fun year for the hobby.

<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno (Tue, 17 Feb 2004 21:39:35 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi, Jim; I got to see a lot of old gaming friends including your brother 
from Thursday midnight through Monday at KinderKon.  It was a great time 
although Dave was just there for a day.  I played 27 games of 21 titles; 
and better yet, I learned 14 new games.  All kinds of them.  Going to an 
all-Dip con or going to a big con and playing two or three games 
intensely can be fun, but playing a zillion different games in a 
skilled-but-silly spirit can be an absolute blast.  The whole con played 
93 games of 59 different titles, and both Bruce and Eric Brosius 
probably learned more games than I did.  You could check with Bruce for 
the whole list.  First let me get the games I'd played before out of the 
way:  Manhattan (the only game I taught), Crokinole (the only I game I 
played with a physical-skill element), Taj Mahal, Scrabble, Empire 
Builder, Ra, and Durch die Wuste (Through the Desert).  Now for the new 
games:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Attika (Hans im Gluck in Germany, English version from Rio Grande 
Games in USA):  Maybe the best game I learned all weekend, Attika is 
themed about Greece's classical age.  When most of Europe and Britain 
were locally fought over by barbarian tribes, people in the Greek 
peninsulas and islands were building complex cities up as in Sid Meier's 
Civilization or various German games.  Attika is partly a positional 
game (like Go with resources on the board), and partly a strategic game 
of using resource spaces and resource cards and affinity groups to build 
the tokens ("buildings" such as Vineyard and Vintner in the Winemaking 
group) which fight to connect two of the board's temples.  A lot of 
blocking makes it a good screw-your-opponent game (even though you're 
basically adding building tokens) for two to four players.  Short enough 
(an hour or so once you've played one time) to complete a game and still 
play something else.  I'll buy it when I get my annual bonus from work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Balloon Cup (Rio Grande Games):  Just a little two-player card game, 
something fun to do for half an hour.  But it's a great theme:  A rally 
of hot-air balloon races.  Four races at a time, worth one through four 
colored wooden blocks.  Cards numbered 1 through 13 in each of five 
colors matching the blocks.  If the race is in the lowlands, you play 
low cards on your side to help you, and play high cards on your 
opponent's side so his total will be higher than yours and lose.  If the 
race is in the hills, it's the opposite:  high total wins so you play 
high cards for yourself and low cards on your opponent's side.  But the 
cards on each side, regardless of who played them, must match the 
blocks' colors card-for-card.  So you may not have the cards you need, 
and you may have to play a card that you really don't want to play to 
help your opponent.  Some colors have fewer blocks but you need fewer to 
win that color's trophy; other colors have more blocks but you need more 
to win their trophy.  Get the majority of the five trophies and you win 
the game.  It sorta feels like the theme, like ballons floating along 
for various amounts of time, since you choose to play on any stack you 
legally can rather than being forced to "move" a specific balloon.  It 
feels like you're being blown back and forth in each race as you and 
your opponent help yourselves and hurt each other.  I know I'll play 
this enough on late-night and just-dropped-in sessions that I'll get my 
money's worth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
... The rest of the new games were all fun to play with these folks; the 
few people who weren't my old friends became new friends easily.  I'd 
play any of these games again, some more eagerly than others.  These are 
in the sequence that I learned them:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Bean Counter (Amigo Games):  Silly theme, and you gotta love any game 
with a "beanometer".  There are eight kinds of beans, and you make money 
by collecting the right combination of beans for your demand cards and 
taking them to the space that wants them.  A little like the 
"Volldampf"/"Age of Steam" pair of games, without track-building.  Some 
beans start at random in each space, and they're replenished when 
certain cards are played from each player's cyclical hand.  Prices vary 
as beans are collected from each space's beanometer and as beans get 
restocked (a few spaces per refill).  When someone reaches 69 points, 
everyone sells their remaining beans, adds the money previously earned, 
and high score wins.  Fun, and not just because I won.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Mammoth Hunters (Ravensburger in Germany, Rio Grande in USA):  It's 
packaged like the numbered Ravensburger featured-game-designer games 
like The Princes of Florence and The Traders of Genoa.  If it had a 9 on 
the box, it would be the first one of that series from our friend Alan 
Moon, a big Diplomacy advocate at 1970s-80s Avalon Hill who hosts the 
annual Gathering of Friends invitational gamecon, and his collaborator 
Aaron Weissblum.  
<i>((Bruce Linsey writes "[Mammoth Hunters] is indeed #8 in the 
Alea series (not #9).  For some reason the version we bought 
doesn't have the "8" on the box, which caused Krissi to not want 
to open it in the hope we could exchange it for a
numbered copy someday."))</i>
Alan sometimes comes to Bruce and Krissi's housecons, 
but missed this one having just gotten married.  Mammoth Hunters is a 
keep-your-tokens-alive-when-spaces-only-support-a-few game rather like 
Trias, or Evo, or American Megafauna, or various other prehistoric 
games.  The board doesn't grow as in Attika, or move as in Trias; 
glaciation removes part of it slowly and the rest is altered by players 
using cards such as moving the campfires around (each campfire adds an 
unknown 0-2 cavemen to the limit a space can support) or moving the 
mammoths around (cavemen who at scoring time are in spaces with mammoths 
count for double points, or triple points where there are more 
mammoths).  Besides the cards, you can compete by throwing your cavemen 
into spaces other players wanted to keep, as in Age of Renaissance with 
smaller groups dying first.  Fun game, and a legitimate challenge 
despite being rather quick.  I'd buy it if I didn't already have Trias.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Zendo (Looney Labs):  This is both the best parlor game and the best 
puzzle game I've seen in a long time.  It's so simple you could use it 
to diagnose autistic children, yet all our veteran gamers wanted to play 
it again.  It uses Icehouse pieces, which are just translucent plastic 
pyramids of three sizes in four colors.  Each piece can be upright, 
flat, or "weird" (neither upright nor flat); each can be touching the 
ground, or not (one can nest on top of another); each piece is pointing 
a certain way based on a ray out of its point, so pieces can point 
through other pieces in the group, or not.  A "master" writes a certain 
rule (such as "The koan" [pyramid group] "has the Buddha nature if: 
there are more large pyramids than medium ones"), then constructs one 
group of one or more pyramids meeting the rule and another group of 
pyramids not meeting the rule, and marks them as such (signified by a 
black or white stone).  Each player then in turn constructs another 
pyramid group, and either asks the master to mark it right or wrong, or 
challenges all players (self included) to predict its validity.  In the 
latter case, those selecting correctly get a green stone that can be 
used to guess the rule.  First player to correctly guess the rule wins. 
It plays very simple, and you don't even need to share a language with 
other players.
<i>((Sounds a bit like a more complex spatial Mastermind....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Big Deal (Amigo Games):  An economic game, where (as in Bean Trader) 
you need sets of resources of several colors.  In this case you have no 
map, and instead of delivering to fulfill demand cards, you invest the 
bean-equivalents required on the stock shares to form corporations which 
pay you income.  There are rules for hostile takeovers which are 
supposed to be important to the game, but I think we played a rule wrong 
which made takeover fights less of a priority.  I liked this game less 
than most others I learned; it's too much like a lot of games I played 
only one time in a multi-game weekend like this where they all tend to 
blur together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Krone &amp; Shwert (Queen Games):  The name means "Crown &amp; Sword", but for 
its play feel in a Diplomacy crowd, think of it as "Junta Lite" - in a 
revolt, players declare themselves loyalist or rebel and play cards to 
strengthen whichever side they take.  But it plays in an hour, a 
fraction as much time as Junta, and it's for four players while Titan's 
best with 5-7 people.  The boardgame part of the game is a fairly simple 
game of placing control markers and city tiles, and using cards to build 
castles and cathedrals which aid scoring.  But only the player who is 
currently king can score each turn; others can score only by 
successfully rebelling (thus becoming the new king) or by supporting the 
winning side in an attempted revolt.  Instead of many cards being 
worthless for a given problem, each card has three values:  strength if 
used in combat, how many empty spaces you can expand into, and a special 
function such as Build a Castle for two coins, or Pope Visits (nobody 
can attack this player or revolt against this player for one turn).  I 
think this will prove to be an excellent game, and it'll probably be the 
next "big" game I buy when I have room in the budget.  With the 
reference sheet in English, I had no problem with the German cards, but 
for my local gamers' sake I'd rather have an English-language version.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Industria (Queen Games):  Another game of building technologies up 
from sawmills and coalmines to computers and robotics.  Another game of 
getting objectives in preferred combinations for extra points, and 
keeping your opponents from getting stuff that would get them extra 
points.  Another game that uses an auction to let players control who 
gets their choice of stuff.  Another game where you need the right card 
plus its required resources to build the objective.  But it all works 
together rather well; it's very competitive because you're all fighting 
over one chart (not filling separate charts as in Puerto Rico or Princes 
of Florence); and there's a lot of opportunity to keep other players 
from big scores, both by bidding high in auctions for what the opponent 
desires and by declining to build a factory that produces something that 
an opponent needs to build his newly-purchased stuff.  I like this game 
and might buy the English-language set.  Again, learning the game with 
the German set gave me only minor slowing, not much problem with 
comprehension.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Mole In The Hole (Ravensburger):  No translation needed here for 
anything except a page of rules.  The goal is to get your mole into the 
final hole (it's like dating!).  Players each have mole-movement markers 
numbered 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5.  Players rotate placing moles on the 
hexagonal board one at a time, then one at a time they move their moles 
the amount on the marker and flip the marker to its blank side, so you 
have to use those six moves before getting a new set of those six 
numbers.  You have to move straight, you have to move the exact number, 
you skip over holes but can't go through moles.  There are a bunch of 
holes in the first level, but when they're filled, the top level is 
lifted off, removing the unholed moles.  Those which made it to the 
second level do it over again, racing to get into a smaller number of 
holes.  The second level survivors fight for three or four holes down to 
the final level, which has one hole.  First player to get a mole in WINS 
the Golden Shovel!  Then we played a variant in which you shuffle the 
move tokens face-down and play them off the top of your stack, as in 
"baseball" poker.  The first way, it's basically a puzzle game, where 
you're choosing which mole to put into a hole (if your available move 
tokens gives you a choice) or where to block others and set up for your 
own next turn.  The only real luck comes in not knowing where the second 
level's holes will be in relation to the moles suriving the first level. 
The second way, there's more luck in what you can play, but that's 
true for everybody, and there's a different skill in playing the 
probabilities when the set of tokens is known and uneven but you know 
only what you've played from the current set of six.  Either way it's a 
rather clever game that people of various ages will like.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- The Yeti Slalom (Amigo Games, Rio Grande in USA):  Another game with a 
funny theme but legitimately worth playing more than once.  Each player 
has four snowboarders (alligators, or kangaroos, or beavers, etc.) 
trying to snowboard down a hill.  However, each player also has four 
cards allowing him to have certain yetis (you know, the much-feared 
Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, yarrrrgh) throw snowballs trying to 
knock the opponents' snowboarders off their boards.  Each yeti throws in 
one of the five rows down the hill, and each throws from either the left 
or right side, so a snowboarder in the left column is most likely to be 
hit by a yeti throwing from the left side of that row, but can't be hit 
by a yeti throwing from the right side.  First snowboarders to make it 
to the bottom multiply a bonus by their rider value (1, 2, 3, 4) for 
victory points, but you can also score for later places by having your 
high-numbered riders wait at the top until your opponents have used up 
their yetis, then coming down whichever side has no yetis remaining that 
aren't in your hand.  This game is good for both laughs and legit gameplay.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Magna Grecia (Venice Connection):  Another build-roads-and-cities 
game, a little like the 18xx family of games without money or stock 
shares, a little like the Java family of games.  You want to have your 
cities be connected by roads to as many other cities as possible, both 
for their own endgame scoring and in order to attract the attention of 
the Oracles for bonus points.  You also want to place a market (one of 
your colored little wooden blocks) in the other players' cities that you 
think will be most connected at the game's end.  A random-but-balanced 
set of tiles controls order of play, how many roads and cities each 
player can build, and how many roads and cities they can bring into 
their ready-to-build queue.  You know only the current turn's and 
upcoming turn's set of limits and turn order, so a good planner can use 
a limited amount of information without the game being flawed by 
over-predictability (like when order of play rotates) or imbalance (like 
when order of play changes randomly by die roll or card shuffle each 
turn).  I might like this game a lot, but we were a little bit confused 
by the rules in our first game.  Remind me to play it again this summer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Paris Paris:  The theme is, uh, running tourist buses around Paris to 
make more money than the other players.  (Where's Godzilla when you need 
tourists to be eaten?)  There are four buslines across Paris; each bus 
station is on either one or two of the four lines.  Each turn, players 
bid for which station they place control markers in, with the unselected 
station's line being scored for a Petit Tour.  Stations at the junction 
of two lines can have two control markers.  There are double control 
markers for each station, so you might own something early but get 
kicked out when it comes up again if you don't bid enough at auction. 
Each busline is scored for the Grand Tour when all markers have been 
auctioned, and each player secretly has one busline in which he scores 
double in the Grand Tour.  The game's not bad, and the auction mechanism 
works pretty well.  But it didn't seem to foster very competitive play 
that would make the auction more exciting.  Still, not bad as auction 
games go.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Finstere Flure (2F Games):  Another silly-but-really-good game from 
this German designer who has his own little game company.  I like almost 
every 2F game I've tried.  In this one, which is best with many players 
(6 max), the players are running away from a horrid-but-dumb monster. 
Players each have a terrified innocent character who moves 1 and 6 on 
alternating turns (number is 1 on white-number side and 6 on 
black-number side), and one who moves 2-5-2-5-..., and one who moves 
3-4-3-4-...  Players move the distance on the top of the token, trying 
to get to the other end of the board and hiding behind stones and other 
characters, then flip the token, so each token is moved once.  (I can't 
believe I'd like any game with a BLARF element!)  Then the monster moves 
according to a fixed set of rules, but the distance varies and the 
players don't find out how far until after they've moved.  At each step, 
the monster looks for the nearest victim straight forward/left/right, 
turns if needed, and steps one space that way, eating anyone in the 
space.  It's a neat puzzle game, with a good screwiness factor as you 
set up a safe hiding place then someone pushes a stone that blocks the 
monster's view and makes it eat your poor guy instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Das Erbe des Maloney (Ravensburger):  The title means "Maloney's 
Inheritance".  Sid Sackson (a longtime designer of simple but elegant 
games) came up with this game, sort of a travel game where the title is 
irrelevant to the game except as excuse-to-be-doing-this backstory. 
Each player has a handful of cards for the (18?) cities, each of which 
is worth 7 points if the train (ridden by all players to one city per 
day) goes there on some particular day of the week, then a point less 
each day until the next week comes around and the value returns to 7. 
This counts double on Tuesday or Friday.  The cards vary so players will 
have different preferred days for visiting the same city.  The strategy 
of the game is in the auction of who chooses where each day will be 
played.  There's a "suitcase" for whoever actually selects each 
destination not previously visited, so there's a bonus adding (or 
subtracting if your luck is bad) victory points or auction money.  The 
suitcase bonus is shared by all players on Sunday.  There's a bonus for 
being first to get rid of all your cards, so you often must choose (when 
someone else takes the players to a city) between selling a card on a 
bad day for one or two points or instead holding it, hoping to return to 
that city on a better day.  The game is rather clever and the auction 
works well, but I was left without a strong feeling of 
loving/hating/oneness-with the play experience.  I might like it more 
after another try.  It's currently out of print (both the English and 
the German language editions) according to Funagain's website.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
... So I learned a LOT of new games and they weren't just forgettable 
reshufflings of the same rule systems with different names and pictures. 
This is one of the highlights of the year for me.  Saw old friends, 
talked about other gamer friends and cons, talked about all kinds of 
things.  Despite spending so much of my time in learning mode, I won a 
few games and got lots of second places out of 4 or 5 or 6.  A couple of 
times I screwed up and, just trying to work out how to play, did 
something for my own best score without seeing how I could deny someone 
else many more points by sacrificing my play.  On the last day I was 
hot, winning two games and coming within a card draw of winning the 
third, after earlier being blocked while a turn from winning.  But I 
still had to come home, get my dog, and get ready for the non-holiday 
portion of the workweek.  Overall, it was a ten-out-of-ten quality event.

Dear Jim, I'm enjoying Steve Langley's letters, especially
the cat sections.
I miss my two cats quite a bit - in fact I've had Tigger
for 14 years now.
I knew his writing style reminded me of someone,
and I've finally realized who it was.
Again, especially when writing about the cat,
he makes me think of the most powerful man in the
Universe in the Douglas Adams "Hitchhiker" books...
the one who lives with a cat in the middle of nowhere.

writing for so long, that he always comes across to
me more uniquely as himself.))</i>

Life in prison continues.
I've had the pleasure of dealing with the medical care
department twice recently, and I've decided it's just
one more reason to avoid incarceration.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day I woke with
a sore throat, stuffed sinuses, a cough, headaches, and
body aches.
Normally, I'd take some sinus pills and be on my way.
But not here!
I can't take any medication unless I am given it
by the medical staff (except for aspirin or tylenol).
The problem is, I can't see the medical staff until 
Tuesday... there is no sick call on Fridays, nor on
weekends, nor on holidays.
Instead of popping a few pills and feeling much better,
I have to wait until Tuesday morning, suffering through
the entire three-day weekend.
In fact, by the time Tuesday afternoon rolls around (pills
aren't dispensed until 3:15 PM), I'm starting to feel
better on my own.
All that so I can get 5 Actifed and 5 Ibuprofin.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On a more serious medical note, a major concern
for me is the monitoring of my skin for possible
cancer.
In the Spring of 2000 I was diagnosed with malignant
melanoma, Clarke's level 3, in my left calf.
I underwent surgery, and a biopsy of a lymph node
showed  the cancer had not spread beyond my leg.
Since then I've had a number of skin lesions removed
and biopsied.
Fortunately, none have been cancerous, although many
have been pre-cancerous displastic nevis.
I was careful to make my history known to the
Bureau of Prisons and the medical staff here.
In late December I submitted a "cop-out"
(inmate to prison staff communication form)
to the Medical Department asking for an appointment
with a doctor or an outside dermatologist for
removal and biopsy of at least three lesions showing
growth and color change. 
10 days later I received my response - I had to come
to sick call (6AM Monday-Thursday) to get an appointment
with the Physician's Assistant, so he could evaluate
my request.
On January 5 I did so.
The PA decided I needed to see any outside dermatologist.
He guessed I'd see my name on the Call-Out list 
within two weeks (the Call-Out list has every inmate in
the Camp with appointments for the following day for any
reason - medical, education, or otherwise).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Four weeks went by.
My name did not appear.
Concerned, I sent another Cop-Out.
No response.
Finally, yesterday I went back to sick call.
The PA had me come back an hour later, and when I did
he informed me that yes, I do have an appointment scheduled...
but it may not be as soon as I hope, and he is not permitted
to tell me now when that appointment will be, for "security
reasons."  
I actually understand that part - if I know well in advance,
theoretically I could arrange a meeting there with an outside
person or something.
So, I'm hoping my appointment will be within 3 or 4 weeks.
Meanwhile the skin lesions slowly grow and darken.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I only have one available course of action besides waiting, and
that would be to fill out a BP-8 form (used to resolve inmate/Bureau
personnel disputes).
But there is my Catch-22.
If I make a fuss and these lesions are fortunate enough NOT to be
malignant, then next time I go through this process I'm bound
to be told "you made a stink last time and it was nothing, so
this time you'll have to wait extra long!"
Sort of like the Boy Who Cried Wolf.
So, for now, I've elected to wait but closely monitor the lesions
I find most troublesome.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Gosh, I really hope this works out OK, but I would suggest
that this may not really be any direct incompetence.
It could easily take them that long to get a dermatology 
appointment given the nature of their payment and contract (which
I'm sure is not top dollar).  
If I were given an option to have a regular physician or even the
PA just remove the lesions, especially the ones that look the worst,
now and then wait to see the dermatologist when they let me, I 
might have gone for that.
So even making a stink might not really help (unless you were doing
the stink just to get someone to remove the lesions now!), if
they can't force the dermatologist to see you sooner.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's it for this month.
Stay in touch, and thanks again to those who sent letters (I responded
to every letter I received).

Jim,
I've been reading the mail of Doug Kent with some
interest. The Allenwood minimum security prison is in
central Pennsylvania, in Union County. Also in Union
Co is the Lewisburg maximum security penitentiary. I
grew up nearby and my elementary school was on a
neighboring piece of property. I can remember being
out on the school play yard for recess (so this was
sometime in the mid 1960's) when a plane flew overhead
trailing a banner that said "Happy Birthday Jimmy
Hoffa." I'd never seen a plane pulling a banner
before, and my parents had to explain to me that Jimmy
Hoffa was a prisoner. All in all, a very memorable
day.

Steve Langley spins a good story about building more planets in his
previous issue of <i>TAP</i>.
But, while gas and dust might accumulate at the Lagrange points - or
even space stations or asteroids - building 5 simultaneous planets
of approximately Earth mass would hardly go unnoticed in Sol's
gravitational balancing act of the Solar System.
Put 5 Earths into one orbit formerly occupied by just one, 
and I doubt the trapeze act would hold up longer than
it took to build.
With 6 Earths in one elliptical orbit, the start locations would hardly meet the 
old Lagrange definition anymore, I suspect.

Pete Gaughan and Mark Lew have been talking about some of the information
coming out about what happened on that 9/11 day itself, including the

were occuring.
My lesson from that is that a lot of the things that happened that day
as people "couldn't believe what was happening, it was too much outside
their conceptualization" would not happen today.
It just wouldn't.
I was conceptualizing all sorts of even worse things before 9/11 that I'm

The true battle of the politics is very present and flamed by Bush's actions.  
I believe the true battle is one of information and with the information 
egalitarianism.  Egalitarianism threatens everyone who has money and power.  
Sure they usually go together.  In the USA the means to secure one's money 
and power has not come at the high expense that those with money and 
power in Islamic countries are creating.  The statistic I'd follow 
most closely if I were you, worrying about Al Qaeda, would be the 
steadily increasing percentage of Chinese Muslims.

Doug Kent and his ex-wife Mara.  I have always counted Doug as a friend and gamer.  
I visited with he and Mara over parts of two days in Dallas once.  
<i>((Yes, I recall you writing about this!))</i>
I remember Doug saying that Mara rarely agreed to see anyone and 
therefore may not have met anyone from the hobby.  
We went to dinner, returned home and played a pinball game they owned.  
I wouldn't be surprised if she won most games.  I had a delightful visit.  
Each life that finishes that touched my life, I am thankful for the 
time and the friendship.  
Doug, I wish you the best with coping with the time on your hands.

I have no earthly idea as to what step health care reform will take next.  
I am working to make the variability and the outcomes available 
information to all.  Probably this summer, if I am not just being a 
manic thinker, I will start a Fantasy Health Care League.  
Like Rotisserie, there will be categories, pick a hospital 
that will have the lowest CABG mortality, a SNF with the least 
infections, a health plan with the highest HeDIS score for 2 year olds, etc.  
There will be URLs on my web site (I have another domain now, 
"Higher Quality Health Care" as well as HigherQuality) that link 
to all sites I can find that report true data.
<i>((Ooooh, this is way cool.
I wanna play!!
I track all that stuff too.
Since it is pretty much useless for any real purpose anyway (we can talk about that 
some time) since people designing systems congenitallly refuse to get
specific about context and audience - what I want to know if I have cardiac
valve disease and am considering a CABG is NOT the standard lowest risk
adjusted CABG mortality, but I want to know what would a person with MY
health history and MY health and socioeconomic and family characteristics
expected CABG mortality be in this hospital?  The system you want, if we
could design it, would be a system where you plug in YOUR characteristics
into a website and get back a tailored report oriented to you.
But the current system is perfectly appropriate for a Fantasy Health
Care League, that I could get into.))</i>

This ties to growing my current work being the "National Quality Monitor" 
for TRICARE as well as being a quality oversight monitor via 
independent medical reviews.  
I doubt I will get anywhere, but wherever I am will be fun.

Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While cleaning up the pile of mail on the kitchen counter Saturday I came
across the last two issues of <i>TAP</i> (#278 and 279).  I generally read <i>TAP</i>
fairly closely (looking for familiar names from the distant past), but I was
surprised to read about Doug Kent's change of address and Steve Langley's
retirement.  I don't really know Doug, but he was the one who contacted me
when I was the subject of <i>TAP</i>'s search some years ago.  I hope that he is      
doing okay in his new environment.  I met Steve when he and Daf were living
in Sacramento in the mid 70s.  They had a Diplomacy get-together and I drove
up from the Bay Area, where I was living at the time.  I remember Larry
Peery and Gary Coughlan attending also.  I didn't know that Steve is now
living in Seattle (I live just north of Seattle in Mill Creek).  Small
world.  Of course Buz Eddy and Eric Ozog both live within a half an hour
radius of my house, but I haven't seen either one of them in years either.
I think that I last saw Buz (whom I introduced to Diplomacy in '67) was when
I attended the DipCon in Seattle sometime in the 90s.  My only purpose for
going to the DipCon was to see Walt Buchanan (who was living in Klamath
Falls, OR, at the time) and Edi Birsan (up from the Bay Area).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As you can probably gather from the above comments, I don't really have any
interest in Diplomacy these days.  I appreciate your invitation to attend
this year's DipCon, but I think that I will pass.  
I am keeping plenty busy with numerous other activities.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To update the few <i>TAP</i> readers who know me (or care), here is a brief summary
of what has been happening in my life in recent years.  Marie (whom I met at
the 1974 Chicago DipCon and married in '75) and I separated three years ago
and divorced a year later.  Last summer I married Joan in a beautiful
outdoor ceremony at Ecola State Park overlooking the Pacific Ocean, just    
north of Cannon Beach, OR.  Joan and I met on the Internet (match.com); she
was living in Fresno, CA, and I was here in Mill Creek, WA.  Joan and I both
lived in the Bay Area (she in Berkeley and I in Menlo Park) in the '80s and
knew the same people, but never met each other.  We both competed in bicycle
races back then and probably were at the same races.  We are also both
runners and now we run on the mountain trails surrounding Seattle on the
weekends.  I am still running marathons (I will be at Boston in April).
Last year I finished third in my age group at Nashville's Country Music
Marathon.  My total marathon count is up to 78 and this April's Boston
Marathon will be my third, having previously run it in 2001 and 2002.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the past 12 years I have been managing the Pacific Northwest offices of
AQUA TERRA Consultants.  We are a small national engineering consulting firm
specializing in hydrologic and water quality computer modeling.  I currently
have a big project for King County (which includes the Seattle metropolitan
area) and am managing a project in San Antonio, TX.  Fortunately we can do
all of the work here in our Everett, WA, office, but I do fly down to San
Antonio now and then for meetings.  On the side I write freelance articles
for local running and hiking magazines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Joan is an RN (nothing like having your own private nurse) who has done
everything (she worked the ER in Oakland, CA).  Currently she is a hospice
nurse working with dying patients and their families (the patients are fine, 
the families are a mess).  Both Joan and I have been taking classes in life
coaching at the Academy for Coach Training in Bellevue, WA.  Joan is getting
out of nursing and now is working part-time as a professional life coach.
She is excellent, although admittedly I might be a little bit biased.  She
has a website (http://www.highestvisioncoaching.net/) where she discusses
life coaching and what she offers potential clients.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, John Kerry is the Democratic front runner. He took Iowa, and now New 
Hampshire. Massachusetts senator, war veteran, moderate rather than 
liberal. He comes as a surprise to the pundits. He promises to stand up 
to special interest groups. I can't say I am impressed by any such 
promise. I'm not even sure what standing up would mean to tell the 
truth. He is for more jobs, more taxes for the rich, less taxes for the 
middle class, against the war, although that is only lately, he was for 
the war a year ago. Tough to say who he really is actually.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((What I find interesting is that I've always liked Kerry
the man WAY better than Kerry the politician or the candidate.
I really didn't want him to run or succeed, but now here we are.
My experience with him as a person goes back 10 years when I was
flying back and forth to Washington on a weekly basis and he
and I were on the same flight about a dozen times over the space
of four months.
I talked to him a few times, and watched others talk to him,
in a situation where he was the Senator from Massachusetts
but wasn't explicitly running for anything.
I liked him a lot as a person, just as a regular guy.
And I find it amusing and scary how none of that comes through
in the campaign, or seems relevant.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One thing for sure, he has knocked Dean out of the front runner 
position. That just might work out better for Dean than not. As the 
identified front runner, Dean was the target for everyone. Now Kerry 
gets that attention. It will be interesting to see how he handles it. On 
the other hand, Kerry has won in two states now. Two is better than 
none. Still, being primaries, Dean has done well enough to capture a few 
delegates too, so he is not totally out of the race.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Late night talk show about the American intelligence services. Part of 
the people calling in think that the president was mis-served, part 
think that the administration listened to what they wanted to hear and 
ignored what they didn't want to hear. There are two UN weapons 
inspectors answering questions, one from Great Britain, one of our own. 
The Brit admits that he does not have the inside story of what was or 
was not said by our intelligence people, but that on his side of the 
water, Tony Blair pretty much told the intelligence services what he 
wanted them to find.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When they started looking for evidence of WMD they fully expected to 
find lots. As time passed they begin to think that there wasn't anything 
to be found. The British administration was not interested in those 
assessments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The American is a lot less forthcoming. The woman who facilitates the 
show is asking lots harder questions than the people calling in. My 
mistake, the latest caller has asked about the war for oil scenario, 
naming lots of names and dates. The Brit does not agree that it was all 
about war for oil. At least it was not the case for Blair. The American 
had no comment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((As I've said before, the thing I find totally insane that we
should think, expect, or most importantly ACT on anything like this
being ALL anything.
Oil, WMD, Democracy, theocracies, and more, each of these factors
are and were part of it.
I understand the deficit and simplification, to be sure, 
but it is a path of insanity, and if
it persists, we really will have the failure of democracy.
Really, even as it seems unthinkable, we will lose democracy as a 
failed structure of government.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm listening to the BBC now. They believe that Kerry has resoundingly 
trounced Dean in New Hampshire. I love their use of language. The next 
report was about the increase of piracy on the high seas. Now that's a 
news report I have not heard mentioned in the local (our) news. Most of 
the piracy takes place in the South Pacific and it is rising. More ships 
are being taken, more crew killed, and there is an increase in holding 
crews for ransom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((See above, think Indonesia, think terrorism and Islamic 
extremism, and you would be surprised if it WASN'T happening.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The final story is really bizarre, and heart wrenching. A British couple 
had four children. Their eldest died as an infant in his first year, 
then they had a daughter, and then twin sons. Both boys died in their 
first year. Their mother, based on evidence given by their pediatrician, 
was arrested and convicted of infanticide. Three years later she was 
finally exonerated. The doctor's evidence was discredited. After three 
years she has been returned to her family. Her daughter hardly knows 
her. Her husband went from a middle management position to out of work. 
Forensic DNA evidence indicates that all three boys had a genetic defect 
that caused their death.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The couple told the story with great restraint. The parents were taken 
by the police and questioned after the twins died. The woman was in 
shock when she was arrested. Not at being arrested but over the deaths 
of her sons. The questioning went on for several days. Their daughter, 
nearly three years old at the time, was taken by the British equivalent 
of Child Services. Once the husband was released he was not allowed to 
see his daughter until he could get a court order. That took him a 
month. His wife was being held for trial. He had his daughter back, but 
he was not allowed to bring her to see her mother. Her conviction came 
as a shock. They knew that there was no substance to the charge.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They sold their home to pay for a continuing investigation. Finally the 
investigators managed to uncover proof that the doctor gave fabricated 
evidence at her trial. Since it was his evidence that had chiefly 
convicted her, she got a new trial and was freed.
Turns out she was the third woman convicted through this doctor's 
evidence in three different cases. The other two cases are being 
reinvestigated now.

The cat is on the small side for cats. I'm guessing about eight pounds 
and slightly pear shaped. She is grey with white trim. She has three 
white feet, just the toes actually, and one white stocking on her rear 
left foot. She has a white patch between her front legs on her chest, 
another between her back legs, with a grey tummy in between. She has a 
white blaze on her neck that merges into the white on the right side of 
her jaw, the left side of her jaw is grey. Above her jaw, she has a 
white area on her left cheek and nose. Both eyes are dark and surrounded 
with grey. The grey is a dark dove grey and pretty much the same all 
over except for about the last six inches of her tail which has slightly 
darker grey one inch rings. You have to catch her in just the right 
light to see the rings. She is a short hair with about the thickest pelt 
I have petted. She feels very plush to the touch. On the grey side of 
her face she has a circular white beauty spot just about 3/4ths of an 
inch under her eye. It is about 1/8th inch in diameter and may be a scar 
or possibly a wart. That's the cat.

I just listened to a rebuttal to a news piece on NPR a few days past 
that had warned about the dangers of the huge deficit budget being 
proposed by our current administration. The rebuttal was from the editor 
of a right wing political magazine. In short the editor said that this 
was a war budget, and that when you are in a war you can't wait for a 
better economy to spend what is needed to fight the war. In actual fact, 
the budget is not a war budget. The war budget part was not included in 
the current budget, it is being held back until after the election in 
November and will be revealed to us then. The current very huge deficit 
budget is for all of the non-war parts of government spending, the war 
budget is still to come.
<i>((And they think they can get away with holding that back 
because when that gets "added" to the score it is not politically
supportable to vote against it, since the men and women "need"
our support.
Another interesting issue IS those men and women and all of the deaths,
physical injuries, and emotional trauma in that population and how
it integrates back into the rest of us.
What do you do when you see an Iraq amputee?
The stories I hear is that most of us don't react "well", which is
accepting, concerned, but not staring mouth agape.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The deficit is needed to just keep the government running and to support 
the continued tax cuts that Bush feels is good for our economy. If the 
tax cuts become permanent, the upcoming administration, whoever they 
turn out to be, are going to have to spend a whole lot of money that we 
don't have. Replacing Bush and company with someone else won't make the 
deficit magically go away. At best it might keep the deficit from 
getting much worse. About the only positive thing that could be done 
would be to turn back the clock and restore the cut taxes. That is an 
unlikely turn of events. Electing a Democrat as president doesn't change 
Congress. And, politicians have never been very big on publically 
increasing taxes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've heard a couple of people lately trumpeting using hydrogen as car 
fuel. There are hydrogen burning automobile engines now. The result is 
water vapor added to the atmosphere instead of nitrogen compounds. It 
all sounds very nice. What no one has pointed out is that while this 
works very well on a small scale, if everyone who drives a car had a 
hydrogen car, there would not be enough hydrogen to go around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hydrogen is the most prevalent element in the universe, so there should 
be lots to go around, but it isn't as common in a pure form here on 
Earth as it is in the universe as a whole. Useful hydrogen comes from 
two sources. The primary source is as a byproduct of oil refining. If we 
start burning hydrogen instead of gasoline, then gasoline becomes the 
byproduct when we refine for hydrogen.
<i>((I didn't know this, but the chemistry of it does make sense.
Thanks for the info, does suggest a balance though where we use MORE
hydrogen cars than we currently have, but not go all hydrogen.
Part of the balance is more batteries too.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other source is electrolysis. Using electricity with pure water will 
release hydrogen and oxygen in gas form. The perfect way to go if we had 
a good source of electricity, and pure water. In the real world 
electricity is polluting to a great degree, and water isn't pure. 
Electrolysis in tap water releases hydrogen and oxygen mixed with 
chemical compounds that are extremely poisonous to all life. On a small 
scale the poisons can be ignored. Small scale being high school lab 
experiment level. On a scale large enough to fuel the world's 
automobiles, the poisons would kill everything on the planet within a 
week.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That would solve the fuel problem certainly, and all our other problems 
as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Until we develop a technology that can selectively break down water into 
hydrogen and oxygen using hydrogen as a fuel really isn't practical. 
Give us twenty years maybe. By then nanotechnology might very well be 
able to give us a usable hydrogen source. Splitting water into hydrogen 
and oxygen that are then burned to give back the water is a very 
attractive looking scenario. Too bad we are not there yet.

The cat has been in a funny mood today. I was reading in the 'warm' room 
and she kept butting her head against my leg. I tried petting her but 
she pulled away from that and started mewing at me. I don't understand 
cat well enough to have any idea what was up with that. I tried 
explaining to her that I didn't understand, and then she would either 
mew more, or try the head butt routine again. This went on for what 
seems like a really long time but was probably only a few minutes. I 
tried opening the door for her, in case I was missing the signal, and 
she looked at me as if I was out of my head. I finally gave up on the 
reading and came into the 'cool' computer room to write this down before 
it escaped me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

I've pretty much stopped watching CNN. So much for my wide objectivity. 
NPR is easier to follow, being radio. I can listen while sitting at the 
keyboard. NPR is far from objective. They present both right and left, 
but most of the news is about the left. Most of the opinion is from the 
left. CNN on the other hand loses my attention. Too much opinion that 
says nothing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The right seems to be making good moves. The accusations about Bush's 
absentee record when he was in the National Guard is being used as a 
means to get contributions, saying that such personal attacks need to be 
countered. He has proposed a bi-partisan commission to examine the 
intelligence about Iraq. The commission is scheduled to still be 
studying the matter all the way through the November elections. A large 
part of the upcoming budget has been reserved until after the elections 
in November. Basically the White House is preempting or capitalizing on 
Democratic moves. Good politics. I wish they were a bit less clever 
about manipulating the public.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the other side, there is more Democratic infighting going on. I 
actually think this is good for the party. The longer they fight amongst 
themselves the less time they will have to fight with the Republicans. 
Democrats don't fight very well. At least that has been my observation 
in the past. The less time they have to fight with the Republicans, the 
less time they have to self destruct.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I did like one quote from a Republican who plans to vote against Bush in 
November. &#207; still own my guns but I can't afford the ammunition." 
Metaphor but apt. It really will be the economy that decides the 
election. The Republicans are telling us that the economy is going great 
and that it is the presidents tax initiatives that deserve the credit. 
Tough position to support. There are a lot of people who don't think 
that their personal economy is in all that great a shape. It isn't clear 
at all whether any of these people will vote. There was another quote 
about that. A woman who had just been laid off said that she wasn't 
going to her party caucus because she had to look for a job.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm finding myself looking forward to the end of this whole election 
thing. I observed decades ago that things change. Nothing lasts forever. 
That includes the government. Maybe especially the government. The world 
is far less than perfect. No matter how good people have it they want it 
better. They want lots of government services with no cost to 
themselves, and they want low taxes. The only way to do that of course 
is deficit spending, and no one wants that, either. So no matter who is 
in charge, after a while the people will trade them in for someone else, 
in hopes of getting more 'something for nothing' than they are getting 
now.

The cat left the house when I got home. I opened the door and she was 
through it at top speed. I have gone back to the door a couple of times 
to see if she wants back in. No sign of her. She hasn't been out of the 
house since Sunday. I give her the opportunity every day. Usually she 
stays well back from the door and just looks out when I open it. Sunday 
she went out when I opened it and was out for about an hour. I wonder 
what she is doing. I hope she keeps out of the street.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While I was walking home I was passed by a big black SUV going at about 
the speed limit. A big orange cat ran into the street right under the 
wheels of the SUV. I'm sure the driver couldn't even see it, the cat was 
so close to the car. I fully expected to see road kill before my eyes, 
but without a pause, the cat was suddenly running in the other 
direction, out from the wheels of the SUV. Cats may not have nine lives, 
but they act as if they do.

I just read an op-ed piece by a right wing columnist on Kerry and 
Vietnam. It was making the thesis that Kerry's use of his having been 
both a hero and anti-war activist over Vietnam could backfire on him. 
Sounded a lot like wishful thinking to me. I do not think that part of 
Kerry's background will cause him a problem. I'm not sure that it will 
cause Bush a problem either. The real issues of the coming election are 
going to be the economy and health care and education. The issues of 
warfare and security are going to be secondary. Too bad for the right 
wing that the American people are getting over being frightened by 9/11.

I'm listening to the BBC on NPR. The BBC is undergoing a change of 
leadership. The recent inquiry headed by Lord Hutton found that the BBC 
was principally at fault in failing to verify the accuracy of its facts 
before publishing the story claiming bad intelligence about weapons of 
mass destruction. Old story, and since there have been no such weapons 
found you would think the BBC could point to those facts in their 
defense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The British government appoints the head of the BBC. There is a very 
harsh interview asking how can the BBC be independent of the government 
if the leader is appointed by the government. The hard questions are 
being answered by a BBC editor in chief. He is the acting director now 
that the latest director resigned. He will probably be the next 
director, but that isn't a given. There is an open audition period as it 
were. Interviews are being done with people who want to become the next 
director.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The government committee that is holding the interviews will make the 
final decision as to who will be the next director. Given all that, he 
is the acting director and has years of experience working for the BBC. 
He is quite passionate about the BBC and its independence from 
government control. The interviewer is just a passionate and finds it 
hard to understand his position. How is the British government choosing 
the head of the BBC any different from any dictator doing the same to 
the news media of his country?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can see that holding interviews with anyone who wants the job is 
different from just picking the head of the news service, but separation 
of news and state it is not. Still, the BBC is in this state of change 
over a resignation following an inquiry about the BBC story criticizing 
the government's going to war in Iraq. There would have been a good 
argument that the news and state were separate, except for the 
resignation. By the way, the results of the inquiry which led to the 
resignation are far from popular with the majority of the British 
people. They are asking for another inquiry to be held.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For all of that I really like listening to the BBC news. I get to hear 
stories and slants I don't get in this country from any other source.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, I really like it too.
That's where I get almost all of my "national" news since I don't
have cable to see CNN and am always still at work when the network
national news is on.  
And newspapers over here just don't have that much depth.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The caucus is over. The story about Kerry and Dean is being rerun by all 
of the news talkers. None of them have been talking about what I 
consider to be the most important part of the story. Democrats have 
turned out in double normal volumes to vote, and they seem to be more 
concerned about a candidate that can defeat the sitting president than 
any other issue. That is truly remarkable to my mind. I see no reason to 
believe they won't all come out and vote in the presidential election as 
well. Al Gore had the popular vote in the previous election. If there 
are twice as many Democrat voters in the coming election the Republicans 
really have a big job ahead of them.

I am observing that people see what they want to see. One of the many 
political pundits I have heard recently was talking about the primary 
process being flawed. He spoke about Kerry having a momentum thing going 
for him that was causing people to opt out of voting for their own 
candidates. He pointed to the poor turnout in the recent caucuses as 
evidence in support of his thesis. In fact, the turnout was double what 
was expected. One man's poor turn out is another man's record.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now I am hardly arguing that the primary process is without flaw. For 
that matter, Kerry probably does have a momentum thing happening. I am 
just pointing out that the pundit expected to see a poor caucus turnout 
because such fit his thesis. He was seeing what he expected to see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That probably explains a lot about why political pundits have such a 
poor track record predicting things. They look at the political 
situation and a thesis springs to mind. From that point forward they see 
clearly those things that support the thesis and do not see clearly 
those things that do not support their thesis. That is, assuming I am 
observing correctly and not just supporting my thesis.
<i>((That doesn't just happen with political pundits....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Personally I would like to see the primary process start much later in 
the year. There will be many months of running for office between the 
end of the primary process and the actual election. Back when the 
candidates had to travel around the country and make stump speeches to 
get their message out several months made a lot of sense. In this age of 
television and internet there is less need for the length of time 
between the selection of candidates and the final election. The 
electioneering process has become big business and several months of it 
can get to be pretty overwhelming to the consumer.

The cat doesn't know what to make of me these days. I start the day at 
the computer and she comes in with me and then almost immediately 
decides to leave. Later I spend a small amount of time in the warm room, 
changing clothes. She just starts getting comfortable there and I toss 
her out and leave the house. When I return she is curled up on my bed 
but more than ready for a return to the warm room. Instead I come back 
to the computer. She is outside the warm room now, mewing to be let in. 
If I were in the warm room I'd let her in, but such is not the case.

Medical Science took a forward step in Korea. They have cloned a human 
blastocyst to the point that embryonic stem cells can be harvested. The 
technique called for a really dedicated volunteer. One Korean woman had 
over two hundred eggs harvested before one was successfully cleansed of 
it's original genetic material and then had her genetic material 
inserted without destroying the egg. Essentially the mother was cloned 
and the stem cells are carrying her genetic markers. Stem cells grow up 
to be any other type of cell they contact. They are the beginning of 
healing many conditions that we have had to endure in the past. They can 
be used to replace diseased or damaged cells that are the root of many 
terminal illnesses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why bother to clone the blastocyst? Embryonic stem cells have to be your 
own in order to work best. Your body may reject alien stem cells. The 
cloning technique still requires an egg, so it is not something quite 
ready for mass production.

A new `buzz phrase' I have been hearing a lot lately is `in an ideal 
world'. It just came to mind because I just heard a military expert, 
discussing the low level warfare in Iraq, say "In an ideal world we 
would not need to rotate troops. We would have people in place who would 
be better trained and not need to be replaced." In an ideal world we 
would not need troops at all, or have I missed something?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was just listening to Reverend Eugene Rivers, a black minister who is 
against same sex marriage. The interviewer tried to ask questions that 
would allow the reverend to make some sort of mistake. I'm willing to 
bet that the reverend was a star in his high school debating society. He 
not only made no mistakes, he made a very logical argument against same 
sex marriage. Not an argument that I accept, but he definitely came out 
ahead in the discussion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
His first position was that he was opposed to using the black experience 
in civil rights as an analogy to the gay position. He thinks that being 
gay is enough different from being black that there can be no 
comparison. The interviewer then played a tape of a speech given by a 
black woman Massachusetts state senator making that very comparison and 
speaking against treating gays as second class citizens. Reverend Rivers 
response was to say that it was truly a great country that could have a 
black woman doing a great job as a state senator, and she could still be 
wrong.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
His second position was that marriage is defined as a union between a 
man and a woman, and that precludes same sex marriage. He so deftly 
dodged all questions about gays being treated as second class citizens 
that you would have thought him a politician rather than a man of god.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I agree with the reverend on one point. It is a great country and it is 
a good thing that an educated man who has great debating skills can 
speak his piece, and still be wrong.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Many of you are participating with other really extensive 
discussions on this with Mark Lew and Bruce Linsey, among others.
As usual, I agree with Mark Lew's position on this, which is that
government needs to be ALL THE WAY IN on contracts between two people
being called marriage (any two people not already in an exclusive union
contract...) or ALL THE WAY OUT (marriage goes back to being a religious
and societal relationship exclusively).
Before you say, how could we manage with taxes, health insurance, etc. etc.
I would say that we could have a VERY nice political world treating everyone
as an individual and abolishing concepts like family tax returns and family
health insurance.
But both Mark and I recognize that our positions are highly unlikely to 
sway anyone, at least I recognize it.))</i>

I lost the cat for a bit today. I toss her from the warm room 
occasionally so that she can get food, water, or whatever. It suddenly 
came to me that she had not returned from the latest toss, and that was 
quite a while ago. I checked the computer room to make sure I hadn't let 
her in without noticing. Nope. Then I checked my bed, always a good 
chance with the cat. Nope. Then I checked her food and the living room. 
Nope. Then I noticed that there was a big ray of sunlight coming into 
the dining area next to the kitchen. Sure enough, in the middle of the 
sunbeam, there was the cat.

Bush just spoke telling his audience that jobs are the big issue. I can 
not but agree with him about the problem. His solution is to convince 
some nameless people to take a chance and create new jobs. That sounds 
too much like wishful thinking rather than an actual program to me. He 
is intent on his tax cuts being good for the economy. I'm not as sure. I 
think that the deficits they have contributed to are lots worse than any 
good the tax cuts might do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some polls indicate that if the election for president were held today, 
Bush would lose. Of course lots can happen between now and November. 
Today's polls can only have the effect of getting a reaction from the 
Bush camp. He has been out campaigning for weeks now. Of course no one 
in his camp calls it campaigning, but when a president goes around 
making stump speeches right behind various Democrat state primary 
elections it is hard to think of it as anything other than campaigning.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The thing is, he is speaking mostly to confirmed Republican voters. It 
is hard to say whether his speeches are winning over any `undecided' 
minds. Traditionally it is the `undecided' voters who decide any 
election.
<i>((You're right, but in election strategy terms, this is the time
to "nail down your base", you worry about undecided people near the 
election when they actually will bother to think about how they are
going to vote.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This year there seems to be a much larger than usual unanimity amongst 
the Democrats than I have ever seen before. Usually Democrats are for 
something and vote accordingly. What they are for can be all over the 
map, dividing the Democratic vote. Many Democrats decide not to vote 
because the thing they were for didn't make it to the final ballot. This 
year they are against something, and it is the same thing for all of 
them. The `undecided' vote may not make the difference.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The latest Bush sound bite says that the tax cuts are creating new jobs. 
"Three jobs here, four jobs there, it all adds up to excitement." Yet 
the job growth is lagging behind the population growth. Unless we find a 
hundred and fifty thousand new jobs each month we are losing ground.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We are outsourcing technical service jobs to India, which is rapidly 
becoming a major economic power by working for us, at a faster rate than 
we are creating new jobs. This will continue until it costs more to out 
source than to do the work here at home. That is a decades size change, 
not something that is going to happen before the coming election, or 
even the one after that. It is unrealistic to expect business to spend 
more paying local workers to do jobs that distant workers can do 
cheaper. What we really need is a huge upsurge in the economy to drive 
the need for more manufacturing jobs. I'm not convinced reducing the tax 
cuts will make that happen. I think we are in for a fairly long bad 
spell and it will take just waiting it out to get past it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((It's interesting how quickly this has become a MAJOR issue of
thought and discussion for so many people.
Even my staunchly Republican father is hepped up on this one.
But Steve is not quite right, in my view.
I think there are three issues to be resolved here, none of which
will be resolved quickly: (1) How much do we value talking to 
Americans on those technical service calls, and what is the 
context and quality difference in the product? (you will soon
see people advertising "all service operators are American"
and the Indians, who are now building their own Western style
shopping malls so they too can have cookie cutter materialism
of the kind they're talking to at work, will get better at dealing
with us.  Which effect will dominate?  That's the question; (2) 
Upsurges in "the economy" is way too simplistic an answer, how
do we take the American economy to the next level of service - social
networks and managing a knowledge economy - while continuing to
outsource jobs that do not require this level of "Americanism";
and most importantly (3) Are we developing the workforce we need
to compete in the economy we are creating (the answer so far is
completely, disturbingly, and incomprehensibly NO)?
And no, waiting it out will NOT do it, we need to find ways to
embrace where we're going and figure out how to be successful there,
or stop it.  Bush and his crew are nowhere near there.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is no quick and easy way for us to get out of Iraq. That is an 
ongoing drain on our combined pocketbook. There is no quick and easy way 
for us to create a million new jobs. It really doesn't matter who wins 
the coming election with respect to those points. What does matter is 
the direction our leadership takes. It is my opinion that the 
Republicans are taking a more harmful direction than needs to be taken. 
I'm hoping the Democrats will take a better direction. I'm pretty sure 
neither of them have a workable solution to our problems.

On the political front I note that Edwards came in a close second to 
Kerry in the Wisconsin primary. Well, strong second then. What I found 
interesting was the demographic. It seems that Edwards appealed to 
Republicans voting in the primary. There are two possibilities in my 
mind. Republicans prefer the more liberal Edwards to the centrist Kerry, 
or Republicans were trying to scuttle the Kerry campaign. I'm leaning 
more to the second. Without the Republican vote, Edwards might have been 
running closer to Dean than to Kerry.

At the same time, the Bush Cheney campaign has just pointed out that 
Kerry has accepted more money from special interests than any other 
Democratic candidate. What they failed to say was that Bush has accepted

On another medical front the Italians have uncovered a whole new version 
of mad cow disease. They test every animal that is harvested, not just 
'downer' cattle. They test healthy seeming animals. They have found 124 
cases of mad cow disease in the animals they tested this year so far. 
Two of those cases are the new version of the disease, never seen 
before. The tests they use are faster and more inclusive and cheaper 
than the tests we use. I'm not sure why we are not using the same tests, 
unless there is a special interest involved. That part about cheaper 
would seem to be attractive to us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What is really scary is that they have found 124 cases so far this year. 
Is that because they have such a lax policy of feeding animals 
contaminated feed? No, not really. They are as careful as we are. Well, 
as careful as we are supposed to be. What they do is test all the 
animals harvested. The ones with mad cow disease don't go to market. How 
many cases did we find this year? How many cases did we miss? I'm really 
glad I stopped eating red meat years ago.

My understanding of their research was that they were not at all
as conclusive as you are making them out to be.
Part of the problem is that the prion diseases we're talking about here
are very, very different from all the other diseases we know.
These prion proteins, once created, tend to continue working their way
around through the environment.
There is some concern how some of these cattle are developing these

Eventually, we may all have to adapt to work with prion proteins or die,

I'm sure most of you are pretty bored with all the politics I have been 
subjecting you to. Assuming you even bother to read it. Problem is, I

I sort of had an epiphany today. Iran is holding an election where all 
of the candidates were selected by the ruling party. There has been 
nothing said about the lack of democratic process from US. It dawned on 
me that in Iraq we are pushing an election that is much the same. We are 
selecting all the candidates. Not much we can say about perverting the 
democratic process by the Iran leaders, is there?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That was funny. I am listening to the BBC and one of their political 
analysts was talking about the elections in Iran. He came up with the 
same observation about why the US is being so quiet about the lack of 
democratic process in Iran. Okay, so my epiphany turns out to be an 
obvious one.

I'm not sure why some days I wake early and some later. I guess I can 
blame the cat. The cat sleeps on me. I am a fairly light sleeper. When I 
wake it is usually with the awareness that there is a cat sleeping on 
me. That awareness is what keeps me awake, whether at 5:00 or 10:00 am.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat and I have worked out a sort of arrangement about my being here 
and working with the computer. She has not asked to be let in lately. I 
have explained in the past that she doesn't get to do anything in this 
room except stay on the floor. She has a small bed I made for her but 
she has ignored it except for the first few days. She does occasionally 
come to the door and mew, but she is asking me to come out more than to 
let her in.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The room next door, which I have dubbed `the warm room' is a different 
story. I go there for reading, video games, DVD. She joins me there and 
spends the day next to me on the couch I have set up. She gets petted a 
lot there. I find that I pet her without actually thinking about it, 
while reading or whatever. It is a good thing she has a forbearing 
personality.

You can write the email that you knew that I'd write on the day that

<i>((Of course we should, since I think we should finally show how

and again.  And IF the Red Sox can finally beat the Yankees
it will make it all the sweeter.  I'm celebrating.

The point of that is:  who would care?  If all we're doing is placating the    
fans of New York &amp; Boston (and I'm sure you don't believe civilization
exists beyond their geographical borders, but I invite you to open your eyes
here) then let's contract everyone else and end this farce.  Let's stop
believing that any other team should matter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((OK.... more seriously, you do recall that the Florida Marlins
won the World Series last year, and the Arizona Diamondbacks before
that, right?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The strange things that Red Sox owner John Henry said earlier this week
should spell it out.  He, of all people, called for a salary cap after he
couldn't hire A-Rod but the Yankees could, and in the process made himself,
the Red Sox organization and all of its fans look completely idiotic
(Consider that he was so stupid he made George look like the good guy.  Do
you have any idea how hard that is?!?).  Do we cap it at $120M, since that's
all he could afford (if he could have afforded $123M he'd have had A-Rod)?
Maybe it should be just above the Dodger's $85M.  Maybe the Devil Rays would
have a different number, say $31M or so, since that's all that they can
afford.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((John Henry is a genuine real guy dude.
Really.
He E-Mails fans directly.
Admittedly he was being a bit obtuse with that quote, but you think all
you want about him, he's assembled the team to turn the Red Sox whole
approach around.
I salute him.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are two points here.  First at the top.  I, for one, am not content to
let the Yankees and Braves buy two of the 8 precious playoff spots every
year.  It is now 9 consecutive years that that has happened, and it is no
coincidence that they have been in the top 5 in payroll every one of those
years.  Does it take more than money?  Of course it does, otherwise the
Orioles and Dodgers would have had better success over that time.  Can you
get to the playoffs without a big payroll?  Of course you can, in fact the 
AL Central winner will have a payroll of less than $65M by default.  But the
system can't go on like this.  The second point is at the bottom:  fans are
staying away in droves in places that can't buy players.  The small-market
owners have no incentive to make their teams better, since they get checks
from George via the Commissioner's office that they can pocket instead of
using on salaries.  Year after year they don't have to put a decent product
on the field, and it shows.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I will note that the greatest screaming is in Milwaukee and I was
serious that you should buy them.
They have by far the best farm system in baseball and as it starts
producing in a few years, whomever buys them will get a GREAT deal.
I would expect the Brewers to win their shot at the World Series in
2007 or 2008.
Given that Red Sox fans have been waiting since 1918, I do not think
that's unreasonable.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So we talk contraction.  Where does it end?  Fold the Expos, Brewers,
Pirates and Royals.  Cut off the Twins, Devil Rays, Marlins (yes, the
Marlins), Reds, Padres, and Rockies.  Now we're down to 10 in each league.
Eventually we'll just get down to the Sox &amp; Yanks, and you guys can settle
it and let us know how it went.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'm perhaps in favor of contracting two teams so each league is
even at 14, but I'm also fine keeping everyone and letting the current
collective bargaining agreement work its way out.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ok, so let's assume that pitching wins in the playoffs.  The lineup gets you
there, and there are (count 'em) 17 all-stars that Joe Torre has on his
bench (I'm willing to bet that he won't have to introduce himself to a lot
of the starting lineup in this year's All-Star Game).  I like my chances in
the playoffs a lot more if I'm a lock to get there.  What part of that don't
you understand?  Ink in the Yankees and Braves every year, and the other 28
teams play for the other 6 spots?  Why bother playing the regular season?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Because we don't know who will get those other six spots.
Plus there are positive possibilities that BOTH the Yanks and Braves
won't make the playoffs this year.  If the Yanks don't make it to 95 wins
(about a 20-25 % chance) they're in trouble and the Braves are in even more
trouble.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Maybe you aren't upset to see the Yankees lose in the playoffs.  I am.  It    
means they bought their way there again.  Call me when it doesn't look like
they'll make it.

<i>((That's enough of that, you're the one who keeps writing, let's talk basketball!!
And though I'm intrigued by the possibilities of the Celtics who are in the
middle of a free-fall that may just turn around like an arrow more quickly
than people think, I mean COLLEGE basketball.
Next issue will be the annual NCAA Basketball Tournament Issue - comments
for print will be welcome, note that I time stamp them all, so people can see
when they were made.
Here, coming up shortly as I type this (perhaps a few days ago as you read),
the two local teams are facing some season shaping college basketball contests.
URI is facing undefeated St. Joe's on Saturday and they will will give them
a great tussle here, though probably ultimately will fall a bit short.
That could mean that both St. Joseph's and Stanford will enter the
Tournament undefeated.
Amazing, though both teams can be beaten (more on that next time).
More promising is the path that Pittsburgh is following this weekend into
next week.
They face Syracuse on Leap Day and then our local Providence College team on
Tuesday.
Both Syracuse and PC play active 2-3 zones that are very tough (PC's is especially
strong this year) and Pitt doesn't have enough outside shooters to break them.
I expect Syracuse to give Pitt a VERY tough battle and they might well win,
but PC is very likely to win.
You know I'll be rooting for it.
If it happens, PC will win the Big East and be well set up for the Tournament
themselves.
The teams leaving the Big East are MUCH worse than the ones joining it, those
of you who are ACC fans, celebrate your last season on top.  
Va. Tech and Miami, and eventually Boston College will only hurt your standing.
This is great fun for Big East basketball, I'm excited.
It's also fun watching a flawed UConn Huskies Women's basketball team prepare
for their Tournament.
They REALLY miss Nicole Wolff, their star that can't stay off the injured list.
It will be a nailbiter all the way there, though they still have an excellent
chance.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note that we salute all Summer/Winter deadlines, even though there
are no orders due.  This is a press opportunity and ensures that you 
have enough negotiating time for Fall orders.
See some of that press below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) As nearly all of you reminded me, the MAP in last issue (if you
did manage to find it) was WRONG.
This issue contains the corrected map.
It almost always is the case (and this is in my house rules) that
the orders are correct and the map is wrong when there is a 
discrepancy.
That was the case here.
I guess I couldn't believe what Russia was doing.... ;-)
See the discussion in the letter col above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILLIAMS to SUNDERING SUNDSTROM): Your comments last ish regarding 
Green Bay were cold-blooded and hard-hearted.  
I laughed, for what it's worth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOFBRAUHAUS-WORLD): We're delighted everyone seems so interested 
in attending Oktoberfest 1901.  
Unfortunately, there might not be enough beer to go around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FIREBALL XL5 to ENTERPRISE):  Come out and fight - I'll kick your saucer-shaped
ass back into the black hole you crawled out of ...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FIREBALL XL5 to BOOB):  You remember me, don't you?  "Oh, I wish I was a 
spaceman, the fastest guy alive, I'd fly around the universe in Fireball 
XL5 ... "  You can google it if you want to know more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to FIREBALL XL5): All I remembered was Steve Zodiac and his blonde bobbing
puppetmation head, but I'm nothing if not suggestible, so I followed 
instructions and recalled much more after looking at Gerry Anderson's web site.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-WORLD): Is there anyone who doesn't want Munich?  
And why didn't Fred get the memo?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IMAGINARY FRIEND to GERMANY):  Look at the bright side - you were over-extended
with this game anyway!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-LONDON/CONSTANTINOPLE): Thank you for not attacking Munich.  
Never mind it's impossible...I really appreciate it.  We'll send beer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IL DUCKY to SULTAN OF THE LEVANTINE-SON):  Greetings, oh Wise One.  
We are awed by your presence, abashed by your munificence, dumbfounded 
by your gloriousity!
We seek friendship, asking nothing in return.  
We hope you will see the truth of our words, and note that we 
seek Universal Truth ... and the destruction of those who would seek yours.  
Good luck, and please stay on your side of the pond.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-PARIS): I guess the DMZ in Burgundy didn't go over well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-MOSCOW): Ditto the DMZ in Silesia.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-EVERYONE ELSE): Anyone see a pattern in the above?  
Fight it now or you'll be next.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Paul, thanks for finishing up as Russia.
You gave it a good shot.
And now there are five, and lots of action on the board.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GUNS, GERMANS AND STEEL to EUROPE): Under severe pressure from the SDS, 
the German government has just adopted a new foreign policy known as 
the Pre-Emptive And Beneviolent Regime Annexation of Irritating 
Neighbors (PEABRAIN) Doctrine.  The PEABRAIN Doctine is the natural 
extension of the existing BOOBS (Belligerent Obsession Over Border Size) 
Plan adopted in the face of imminent boredom ... er, double digit 
unemployment in major industrial cities.  PEABRAIN Inspectors have been 
unilaterally dispatched to Italy, where they will immediately conduct an 
extensive, exhaustive, and otherwise ethereal search for rumored caches 
of supplies produced by Italy's secret and illegal Woefully 
Misused Dots (WMDs) program.  Failure by PEABRAIN Inspectors 
to find WMDs will trigger the "Just Cause We Can't Find Them 
Doesn't Mean You Don't Have Them" provisions of the PEABRAIN Doctrine
(Section 4UR411-UR2B86D) and will result in the immediate invasion 
of Italy by disgruntled SDS volunteers wielding baseball bats 
and ballpeen hammers.  Success at locating WMDs will pretty much
do the same thing, but we'll feel better about ourselves.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS): The French army, inspired by bubbly during the New Year's celebration 
is now back on the offensive. They haven't bathed or brushed their teeth since 
the first of the year. This way the Italians might now know we are the enemy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to SEAN):  Don't worry, Sean ... we'll eventually find a net big 
enough to capture you.  Then getting a hold on you will not 
be the problem it currently is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to ITALY):  If I'm not mistaken, this is the first time I have crossed my
 national boundary since 1901.  (Denmark doesn't count - we consider our 
presence there an act of beneviolent (new word I just coined, meaning 
"we're bloodying you for your own good") annexation, 
fomented by the Students for a Despotic Society which, as you may recall, 
stormed the gates of Copenhagen in protest over the lack of Starbucks 
and MP3 players on the open market.)  In fact, only England and France 
in this game have ever witnessed me leave the country, and then only 
briefly.  This is nothing to be scared of, sir - you should feel honored!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE to DON): "It seems to me that your antenna doesn't bring in too 
many stations anymore."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DUCK to BARNO):  Wanna waltz to the break of dawn?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE PRESS GHODS): Hoooahhh!!!
Amen!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to LONDON):  Why do I feel so fatalistic turning my back to you?  
Some lessons are hard to shake.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MUNICH to BURGUNDY):  Same question and comment, 
but with a snivelling French accent.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KAISER to SULTAN):  Thanks for the loan ... if, indeed, escrow closed 
and I've taken the keys to the new place.  If not, well, heck ... 
you'd be a lying liar, and no better than the rest of us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Draw passes.  I'll have the SC counts next time, then print End Game
Statements the issue after that.
Thanks, everyone, I wish Buddy well in his illness motivated transitions.
I hope you (through Jim and directly) will keep in touch.
But given that Buddy was likely to have to resign, I think that pushed
everyone over the edge into calling it a draw.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
Fall 1915 is one game year by that measure.
PS I may do a GM judgment call that no "real" center movement
has occurred if there are only small insignificant trades of
centers that are done.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I forgot to put your deadline in last time, but this
is one of our "soft" Winter turns with no changes.
Please get your Spring orders in for next issue!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
The two man race among those who actually are playing is winding down....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) That turn coming up for April 3rd should pretty much decide things.
We're in the last year now.
The "excitement" for this game seems to have faded quite a bit.
I usually like to have one game of this going and would be looking
for a new group of players for next time.
Perhaps I should just CHOOSE deadwood from the sub list and forcibly
inject them into the game.... that would be fun, to see if I could
get them to submit orders....
anyway, if there is interest in a game to follow this one, please let 
me know!!
Note that there is a press spike this time and Karl Muller sneaked
into a tie for third.
The "active guys" Paul and Lee lead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LEE to JACK):  Why did you ever give up that posh PA address?  And stop
thinking about bombing me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(NEW ENGLAND to OLD ENGLAND):  I've got my sailing shoes on, by George.  And
not Boy George.  Mr. George.  Mr. Lowell George of Lowell.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DR. TELLER to YOU JIMBOOB):  I have four complaints to make regarding this
game: 1) My name was used for this Diplomacy variant last millenium, and I
understood that to be used more than once I had to give permission or sell
the rights; 2) I worked long and hard to earn my Ph.D. and like Dr.
JimBoob, I want to be called that, posh on this Eddie stuff, that is for
the birds and the birdsans; 3) Please write your congressman and have them
vote to change the name of Lawrence Livermore Lab to Dr. Teller Lab silly
birds and boobs; and 4) the press in this game is dreadfully boring.  If
y'all don't do better, I shall have to pull the name rights, whether or
not you use my appropriate title.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE LATE DR. TELLER): I'm sorry to have to inform you of this,
but you are STILL dead.
And unfortunately, like Mickey Mouse is hopefully about to do if
the evil Disney Corp. can't bribe enough members of Congress, 
you are now in the public domain.
Maybe you should get Disney behind you if you want respect.
After all, if they can get a cartoon mouse to get attention
in the halls of Congress think what they might be able to
do with a real scientist?
But even those in the public domain deserve respect.
Though I will note that <b>***I***</b> get no respect.
In the end, though, you own nothing once you're dead.
Will, shmill!
Like Ted Williams, who knows if your descendents didn't just have your
head torn off and frozen at Nucor?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JOHN to TWO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD):  Now is the time to activate the plan I
emailed you about and you agreed to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JESUS): Heaven is wired, right?
(There is this web site where you can ask Jesus questions in a Turing
test attempt to AI Jesus, if I can find it I'll put it in here....
it's supposed to be www.crucify.com, but I couldn't get it to work,
probably overwhelmed these days...
but it's not supposed to be that good anyway.)

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
I'm not setting up a separate scoring method.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CLAY to PEBBLE): What a jam up!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOMER - FIELD): (*honks horn*) c'mon everybody, move it!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JOHNNY PESO to HOMER): Homer, find your soul mate.  I think 
she went the other way!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MARGE - HOMER): Have a little patience, it's a traffic jam.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LISA - HOMER, MARGE): Mom!  Dad!  Can we move?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BART - FIELD): So long, suckers!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to RICK): Jump the field, why dontcha?  You gonna beat us all to the first
sprint line?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CHIEF WIGGUM) Guatemalan Insanity Peppers for all!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(OFFICER - CHIEF WIGGUM): We have a massive traffic jam on Main St.
What should we do?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WIGGUM - OFFICER):  I'll be there right away.  (*clicks off*) 
Hmm...donuts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KARL): I hope you guys decide to chase Zedd this turn so I can 
replenish with something other than 3s!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(APU - ZEDD): Stop by the Kwik-E-Mart and get a tasty snack!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to DAVE):  This your game to make the rest of us sweat?  I figure you must
have this game figured out by now!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to BOOB):  Total replenishments by turn?  Just to see I understand what
you're doing, next turn, Rick's 22 points from this turn won't be included in
his "Total Replenishments"?  Or, am I misunderstanding, and you're really going
to report total cumulative replacement points?
<i>((I'm going to report turn by turn AND total
points, you'll see as we go forward.))</i>
Hmm, ... interesting.  What are you trying to do?  Give away ALL my secrets?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Close, but the miscalculation/bad guess over Naples caused Ukraine to
fall ONE center short of winning.
So, we continue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "Ooooh, the abyss is so close to home;
There's an angel standing here at the end of this song, his eyes are
staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread, his face is
turned toward the past." is a quote from "Sorcerer" off of 
<i>The Curse of the Mekons</i>.
This is about where this game is, isn't it??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG, STARDATE WHO CARES): We have achieved a minor 
victory in our battle with the Romulans.
Per my orders, I had Mr. Spock and Mr. Kyle beam five photon
torpedoes near a Romulan troop transport war bird.
The plan worked "perfectly" with the destruction of the bird
and all hands on board.
This will slow down but not stop the Romulan advance.
The bad news is that Romulans have taken one of our spaceports
on the Ferengi homeworld and have the starship Excelsior
almost completely surrounded.
Our foothold on Ferengi is about to end.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A CONVERSATION BETWEEN KIRK (K) AND SPOCK (S) AND DR. MCCOY (M)):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Nice job beaming those photon torpedoes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I'm not so sure you should thank me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What do you mean?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - One of the photon torpedoes detonated a microsecond too fast
causing a massive overload in the transporter matrix (whatever that is).
The explosion caused a dimension shift that temporarily
enveloped the Enterprise for that microsecond.
According to our readings we temporarily crossed into
the threshold of the "Perpendicular Universe".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - I did see a quick flash, and suddenly I have an urge for some
Ferengi beetlejuice.
I thought the perpendicular universe was just a theory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - It was just a theory until now.
Our scans clearly picked up stable protomatter, which in theory could
only exist where the two parallel universes intersect at the perpendicular
universe.
The existence of this matter at a dimensional shift in our scans is
the proof.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Spock, I don't understand something.
<i>((Just SOMETHING, is that all???))</i>
If the Enterprise was forced into this dimension from our universe,
shouldn't we have come out on the other side into the perpendicular
universe?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Absolutely, Captain.
I can't explain why we did not end up in the perpendicular universe
or how we were reflected back to our universe.
I don't even have a theory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Hell must have just frozen over, Spock doesn't have a theory!
Is "we were lucky" the best you can come up with?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - We were luckier than you think, Doctor.
The battle took place near Ferengi.
If we had gone through to the other side we would have all been
changed into Ferengi by the stable protomatter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Mr. Spock, I'm ordering no more Photon Torpedo Transports.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG 2): The Cardassians and the Klingons have
agreed to help us against the Romulans, but the Bajorans
have refused.
As a response to Bajoran resistance the Klingons and 
Cardassians have decided to invade Bajor.
If you can't join 'em, beat 'em, Kirk out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to KURT OZOG): I'd be interested in
your reasoning for handing the game to Dave.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to DAVE): Nice try in Iraq.
