<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>.

<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we will see.
There is interest in a NEW regular Diplomacy game.  Sign up, let's see if we can get seven!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started in January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my next game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

DIPLOMACY: First off, another regular Diplomacy game is open.  Spencer Sawyer,

1) Here we go, back in business.  Thanks to Marc for playing out the German position.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE BARNO to RICK DESPER and WARREN GOESLE):
As part of yesterday's Jackie Robinson Day, major league ballplayers all wore number 42. 
That must have been hell for the old-school types who 
still score the plays instead of waiting for online stats. 
I thought of this because I used to do the official scoring for auto 
races before cars carried transponders for electronic scoring. 
Can you imagine writing down "3" for dozens of cars each lap if 
NASCAR commemorated Dale Earnhardt by having everyone use his number?  
With the nine-figure budgets of baseball teams these days, maybe they'll 
implant RFID chips into ballplayers to aid computerized scoring and instant replays.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE BARNO to DON WILLIAMS):  How in the world did Wigan win the FA Cup tournament 
and get relegated down from the top league in the same season?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE BARNO to TELEVISED SPORTS NUTS):  I got a big kick out of the Fox 
camera-on-wires that had a cable fall onto the track and grandstands at the 
May 26 Coke 600 at Charlotte.  
I said before the race it was gonna happen, and the risk of doom has been 
clear since they put one in the Dallas NFL stadium a couple of years ago.  
They're lucky there were only a few injuries and some damaged race cars.  
If the camera mule had fallen, people would probably have been killed.  
Racing isn't as dangerous as Fox Sports.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TELEVISED SPORTS NUTS): I don't watch much sports on TV, on radio 
you can't see the cameras OR the wires, but this is amazing.  I heard about
the 42's, but heard neither of the other two stories.

1) We still have two medical replacements, as Buddy's son Jim 
(who some of us played with many years ago as James Alan) will be 
playing for Buddy as Eric is playing for Terry. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Here we go again, and there is real cooperation still going on!
I'll keep this chunking along now.
Thanks to Doug for playing this out to conclusion, not only are his
strings cut, but his survival has run out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) With three survivors left, a DIAS FGR and a GR draw both fail and the
FGR is reproposed.
Please vote with your Spring orders, as always no vote is a veto.
Please be clear on your vote if you want the game to end.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MOSCOW-WORLD): I'm all in favor of an FGR draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-JIM-BOB): thanks for the delay.  
I was indeed at Weasel Moot and playing Dip.  
Not necessarily well, but supporting the hobby regardless.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to MATT): Watching the brilliant Chris Martin ace another solo
and bag another tournament would have been fun, sorry I missed it!!!
I think it was cool that Paul Windsor showed up, wish I could have 
met him as well as seen you again, maybe next year.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i>
Can you believe it?  <i>Graustark</i> and John Boardman are still going forward.
We've just started a Memorial game in The Founder of the Feast's honor, Allan B. Calhamer.
This is possibly one of the last fully postal games, with no Internet contact by 
the GM, in the history of the hobby.
It weighs heavily on me, I know that.
And I drew my least favorite country, France.
Harley Jordan nailed down my MOST favorite country, Italy.
And the irascible Doug Kent is my natural partner Russia.
The redoubtable Hank Alme is Turkey.
The rest of the Western Triple is the Shark Chum himself, Jim O'Kelley,
and Melinda Holley is Germany.
John Boardman claims Melinda also is the VERY first female player in <i>Graustark</i>.
Finally, last but certainly not least, Socrates' master himself, Don Williams,
is AUSTRIA!  Again!!
This most recent issue of <i>Graustark</i> is issue number 793, so very soon he will
hit 800.
He still has over twice as many issues as me.
And if I stick with turbophreak Doug and publish 12 issues a year for the next 40
years, until I am 95, I might be able to pass where he will end up.
Amazing!
We will have to figure out some way to make these issues of <i>Graustark</i> available
to all of the rest of you.  
I guess Doug can scan them in and post them in his archive.
Remember, everyone, the magic words, balance of power...</b>
