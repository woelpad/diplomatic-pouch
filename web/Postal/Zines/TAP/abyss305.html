The szine is late again, so I pushed deadlines back a week.
Lots of orders coming in for the new Phil Reynolds Memorial game, good start!!!
Let's get some of the other games started.
We have <i>Tinamou</i> and <i>By the WAY</i> issues in the postal version and on the web.
JOIN the 23 TUNES GAME!!!  SEND ME THREE TUNES AND COMMENTARY!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
We have another exciting issue of <i>By the Way</i> in this issue if everything
is going as planned.
We're making progress on starting new games, help fill things up, see below for more.
The new regular Diplomacy game has started, Spring 1901 results in the next issue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARGARET GEMIGNANI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, now, why Margaret?  Margaret, of course, is one of the most famous personalities in 
Dipdom, Science Fiction, Star Trek, Comic, etc. fandom.  
She was a nurse in the DC area, I believe, and then retired to Florida some years ago.
Many people had an address for her in Fort Lauderdale (including me), but that address
went missing around 1994.
If you do Google searching, as I have done off and on, there is a Margaret Gemignani
that contributes to the Baltimore and Ohio Historical Railroad Association, along with 
a husband, Gino (anyone know if that matches.... the B&amp;O matches where she used to live...
but don't tell me, use it as info to go looking yourself!!!)
Margaret has a couple of mentions in the Diplomacy AtoZ and I first encountered her
in the old Bernie Oaklyn <i>Le Front</i> szine.
I think it would be fun to find her.
We also have a leftover letter on Jeff Key from Mark Lew below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jeff, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jeff Key or Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<br /><br /><b>Mark Lew (Tue, 5 Sep 2006 19:46:38 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I confess, I never read <i>TAP</i> promptly and I rarely read it completely 
either.  Today I happened to see a paragraph about the search for Jeff 
Key from the Aug 10 issue.  The way you talk about the "Key Lepanto" 
makes me wonder if you've got it wrong. (Or maybe I'm remembering it 
wrong.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No, I know, but I didn't say it very well..... so why don't you
explain more properly and then I'll quote from the Official Mark Berch
A to Z definitions.  Although, Mark Berch DOES say that Jeff originated
both the Key Opening and Key Lepanto.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As you no doubt know, plain old vanilla Lepanto is spring 01 A Rom-Apu, 
F Nap-Ion; fall 01 F Ion C A Apu-Tun; winter 01 build F Nap; spring 02 
F Nap-Ion, F Ion-Eas; and fall 02 F Ion &amp; F Eas C A Tun-Syr.  The idea 
was that in spring 02 Turkey doesn't see it coming so he doesn't leave 
anyone in Smy or Arm, and therefore in fall the convoy to Syria can't 
be bounced.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The generic label "Lepanto" later came to be applied to any variation 
that tries to convoy an army from Tunis to somewhere in Turkey.  (And 
I'll resist the urge to point out all the reasons why the name isn't 
very apt historically....)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The "Key Lepanto" was not invented directly, at least not the way I 
remember it.  The opening that Jeff invented was the plain old Key 
opening that originally had nothing to do with the Lepanto.  The 
essence of the Key opening is that in spring 01 Italy moves A Ven-Tri, 
and then in fall 01 A Tri moves on to Serbia.  The idea here is that 
the A-I alliance gets one more unit into the Balkans early.  Austria 
tries to get both Rum and Gre while Italy gets Tun and Ser.  Obviously, 
the illusion of an A-I war helps in the diplomacy for fall 01 to trick 
R and/or T into leaving something insufficiently defended.  Then if it 
works out they've got three in place to possibly pop Turkey out of 
Bulgaria in spring 02.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The generic label "Key" later came to be applied to any variation where 
Italy sends an army through Trieste with Austria's blessing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The "Key Lepanto" is a later hybrid that tries to do both at once. 
Presumably the illusion of the A-I war is less effective since if Italy 
was really going after Austria he probably wouldn't send A Rom to Apu; 
but at the same time it has the common theme of getting Italy's units 
forward quicker in an A-I alliance, both the army in Serbia and the 
fleet still in Ion for the start of spring 02.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't know that Jeff invented the Key Lepanto.  I think he just 
invented the Key, and then the other variations came along later.  
(Somewhere in a box I've got Mark Berch's lexicon of Diplomacy, which 
probably details all the openings and their histories.)

<i>((You can access the full Diplomacy AtoZ on the Internet through the 
TAP home page.  
Here are some of those original definitions as written by Mark Berch,
note the Key Lepanto entry was edited somewhat by others later, Mark
Berch himself is welcome to chime in:))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KEY OPENING: Named by Jeff Key, the inventor, of an
Italian-Austrian opening with A(Ven)-Tri-Ser (usually with Austrian 
support to foil A(Bul)-Ser), A(Bud)-Ser-Gre (latter with support from 
F(Alb)).  Since Italy gets his build in Ser, he can do F(ION)-AEG/EAS. 
This opening is particularly valuable if Turkey opens F(Ank)-Con, 
since the traditional Lepanto is almost certain to be foiled.  If 
A(Bul)-Gre is believed unlikely, Austria can step up the naval pressure 
on Turkey with F(Alb)-ION.  Italy can readily stab Austria with 
A(Tri)-Vie, A(Ven)-Tri, or by gaining Turkish support for 
A(Apu)/F(ION)-Gre, plus A(Tri)-Alb to cut support. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KEY LEPANTO: A specific variation of the
Lepanto series of Italian opening moves: A(Ven)-Tri, A(Rom)-Apu, F(Nap)-ION.
The intent is A(Tri)-Ser, a Key opening without the camouflage (and risk to
Austria) of A(Rom)-Ven. A(Apu) is presumably heading for Tun, thus passing up
one of the main values of the Key opening.
Unfortunately for agreeable Austrian players, most Italians allowed into
Trieste refuse to move out in Autumn, with horrific consequences for
beleaguered Austria.  Consequently, despite the overwhelming popularity of the
Lepanto as an opening, the Key Lepanto itself is rarely seen.  
If we considered the moves A(Ven)-Tri and F(Nap)-ION to be the stem
of the Key Lepanto then we have the following variations:
A(Rom)-Apu (Key Lepanto);
A(Rom) H, (Key Lepanto, Rome Variation);
A(Rom)-Nap (Key Lepanto, Naples Variation);
A(Rom)-Tus (Key Lepanto, Tuscany Variation).
Note that the A(Rom)-Ven move is known as the Stab Lepanto.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.
Actually, in an update, the Semifinal games will begin in Mid-September.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen anything on progress in these games,
and that's why.
But the pairings have just been announced.
More on that next issue!!!
Thomas Franke and David Partridge are in a game together that seems
on first glance to be the weakest in the rest of the players.
So my first thought is that one of those two will have a slot in
the finals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.

However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
But most of the talk that there has been has about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson

This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really

I'm not sure what is going to happen now, but basically everywhere 
except in Russia the game pretty much failed.
The AI was not good (not a huge surprise) and it just required too many
updates to get it to work.
Besides, it really was designed for "real time" play and everyone
doesn't want that.
To find out more general information on DIPLOMACY please visit

but I think it is about to wither away and die.
In sum, I think that is too bad.
But the hobby as a whole is going strong with thousands and thousands of
Diplomacy players worldwide.
REALLY!!!
Speaking of worldwide, there's been a resurgeance of the Australian/New
Zealand hobbies lately after three years of relative quiet.
Here's an update from my teddy bear cuddly pal, Sean Colman
of a statement by Phil Davies!!!
This is the good side by the way, they've also been feuding over
how/when to allow younger Dippers to play relative to having side
games of poker and drinking to go on.
As always, it is a shame when greater hobby energy translates
into rule mongering and feuding.
Here's to hoping that Sean and others come to their senses and 
focus on PLAYING and having FUN.
I choose here to focus on the good plans for the future....

again in 2007.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplomacy Association of Australia &amp; New Zealand "DAANZ" 
(www.daanz.org.au) has decided to conduct the Annual Australian 
Sanctioned Championships at AGE in 2007 as well. As with Carcassonne &amp; 
"Settlers" the first prize will be a return airfare to the world 
championships.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The plan for AGE 2007 is to aim for 40 Exhibitors, with a target of 3000 
attendees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To achieve this, advertising will be conducted in all Australian State 
Capitals.
Hasbro Australia has agreed to be lead sponsor to help achieve these 
targets.
Hasbro Australia and Mayfair Games have already indicated they intend to 
be Exhibitors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I will be attending and exhibiting, at The Chicago International Toys &amp; 
Games Fair (www.chitag.com) in November 2006, in an effort to gain 
further International exhibitor support.
The Australian board game market, clearly has reached a maturity level, 
especially with the Euro style games, where an event such as this is 
justified and sustainable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The 2007 Expo will encompass not only board &amp; card games, but games of 
all types, including Table Top Games, Role-playing Games and Collectible 
Trading Card Games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I encourage you, to take the step of being an Exhibitor at the 
Australian Games Expo 2007.
Please take the time to visit the Expo website. www.austgamesexpo.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I look forward to your response and discussing your involvement in the 
Australian Games Expo on 9th &amp; 10th June 2007.

I want to pick up the music commentary again and run a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
You send me 23 tunes and five or six lines of commentary on each.  I print them
with comments from me 2-3 at a time and then YOU have to guess who submitted each
set of tunes for that issue.  I give "bonus points" for quality and subtract points
for really lame selections.
Mark, forget how the scoring goes, one point for each person you guess right each issue,
correct?
To enter, you can send them 2-3 at a time, or you can send me the whole list of 23 tunes.
But I think we should be able to get at least ten people playing.
I have an advance commitment from Brad Wilson to be in, so this should be FUN.
When we're done, whoever wins I'll try to figure out how to make a CD of tunes from
the list for them.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
I'll start things up in a couple of issues once I have enough entrants.
I've got three people in now, I need more of you.
To get started, I need THREE songs, the first turn will be three songs, and then
two for each of the next ten rounds.
Send me three tunes now with a bit of commentary, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
I should be able to get a dozen entrants!!!

Sports: My World Cup record was excellent until the semis. The biggest 
glitch was, I had Australia picked to beat the Italians-and didn't they, 
really? I picked all the quarters correctly; but I picked both semis wrong 
(yeah, I had the same finals prediction as Goz!). God, what a mediocre 
tournament; like your other readers, I hate dives even more than I hate 
shootouts. But this is a cultural thing; we're taught as children that 
it's unethical and un-macho to fake an injury or "game" the game. As long 
as the international game chooses to incorporate diving, the U.S. team 
will be second-rate.

Apparently I'm running for commissioner of the wrong sport.
It appears that the Red Sox will not qualify for the playoffs in
2006, so they should run as an independent.  The Cubs, of course,
won't be able to collect enough signatures to qualify as an
independent in 2006, but they will for "next year".

The Red Sox claim that they will be running as an independent, but
they claim they will still "represent the AL".  But for some reason
they are trading many of their prospects to NL teams.

I don't think it's mathematically likely for the WC from the NL to

possible, and it seems likely that 84 or 85 wins will do it.  Note

preliminary post-season award picks

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL
MVP: Jeter;
This is more of a prediction than who I would vote for.  I would say
Ortiz is ahead right now, but if he's not going to play much in
September, he's got no chance of winning.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cy Young: Santana;
By a whisker over Roy Halladay.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rookie: Papelbon;
Based a lot on his early season stats, and Liriano's injury.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Manager: Leyland;
Should run away with this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL
MVP: Pujols;
Beltran also a good candidate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cy Young: no idea;
Who can you give this to?  Brandon Backe?  No really dominating
pitcher in the NL this year.  Even Gagne's not a candidate.  Trevor
Hoffman?  Billy Wagner?  Maybe somebody will pull ahead in September.
Could be Oswalt or Penny or any of a number of people.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rookie: Josh Johnson;
Leading NL starters in ERA.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Manager: Willie Randolph;
Also likely to run away with the award.  Mangers of the Year are the
easiest to pick this year.

Let me throw my 2 cents worth back in...
Rick picked the Dodgers to win the NL West, but did not comment on
the entire division.
I'm not one that's big on individual awards in team sports but:
Jermaine Dye has to be considered for AL MVP, and Carlos Zambrano
has to be considered for NL Cy Young.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 29 Aug 2006 08:29:24 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh right, Zambrano.  He was the one, along with Webb (I said Backe
but meant Webb) that I thought would be leading in the NL right now. 
But 14-5 isn't with a 3.31 ERA isn't <i>that</i> impressive.  He'll need
to finish strong.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((More than not impressive, for the National League, it downright stinks.  
He'd have an ERA of about 4.50 in the AL.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Usually I expect a couple pitchers to have 17-18 wins at the
beginning of September.  Nobody in the NL has more than 14.  Also I'm
looking for an ERA below 3.00 and a WHIP below 1.20.  None of the
leading candidates has all of that in the NL.  If Pedro Martinez were
not injured the award would be his to steal with a strong September. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((That is for sure, but Pedro is doing the slow breakdown that we all knew 
would happen when we let him go in Boston.  He's also doing an ERA point 
better in the NL than he would do in the AL, and he knows it!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jermaine Dye's had a nice season, but I don't think it's quite
MVP-ish.  He isn't even the scariest hitter on his own team.  (Maybe
he should be but I'd much rather see him at the plate in a clutch
situation than Thome or Konerko.)  If you want to go by hitting
alone, I would take Ortiz or Manny before Dye.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, but Manny and Ortiz have no chance, so I think Dye does have a 
chance.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The MVP is a silly award in any case.  It rarely goes to the best
player, because lughead writers go off in an absurd re-definition of
the word "valuable" which apparently includes "playing for a division
winner" as well as "not a pitcher, unless we're stuck looking for a
candidate".  (It still annoys me that Pedro lost to Pudge in 1999.)

<b>SPY DIPLOMACY (Variant, revised Dec. 1986)</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
by Jim Burgess

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rules:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Unless otherwise specified, the standard rules of Diplomacy apply.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Players receive adjudications for their own armies and fleets, but not
the armies and fleets of other powers.  Similarly, each player sees only
his or her own section of the supply center chart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) In addition to the standard units, an unit called a &#223;py" is added.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Each of the seven powers begins with a spy in each home supply center.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies are supplied only by home supply centers (i.e. Russia may have
as many as four spies at a time while other powers are limited to a maximum
of three).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies are "built" and "disbanded" in Winter seasons at the same time
as other units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) There is no limit to the number of spies that may be present in any
province and spies may be "stacked" with armies or fleets (exceptions are
listed in Rule 6).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Spy Reports

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spies report the location and nationality of armies and fleets in
the province they occupy and all adjacent provinces immediately following
the standard Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons (i.e. just prior to
the spy movement seasons).  Spies can differentiate between units in retreat
and successful attackers when two units &#246;ccupy" a province.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies also report the nationality of spies in the province they occupy
and the presence (but not nationality) of spies in adjacent provinces at the
same time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Movement of Spies

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spy movement follows the collection of spy reports, so orders to spies
may be made conditional on any information gathered by spies on opposing troop
movements or the adjudication of one's own units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies move after each of the following standard seasons: Winter,
Spring, Summer, and Fall (note that all spy movements PRECEDE Autumn
retreats), beginning with Winter 1900.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies move as armies do with the following exceptions:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Spy movements cannot be stood off by movements of any other unit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spies may be convoyed by fleets of any power during any of the
four movement seasons for spies.  The convoy orders for fleets in these
seasons must be ordered by their owner in the usual fashion or else the spy
convoy movement fails of execution.  Fleet convoy orders for spies may be made
in addition to regular Spring and Fall moves (note, however, that the fleets
themselves never move during spy movement seasons).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spies may also be "picked up" and carried by fleets of any
power. Embarkation and debarkation are moves that must be made during a
spy movement season and "permission to board" is not required.  Embarkation
consists of a movement from a land province to an adjacent sea province
containing a fleet.  Debarkation consists of a movement from a sea province
containing a fleet to an adjacent land province.  A spy may not &#223;witch
fleets in midstream".  Once boarded, a spy may only get off by debarking.
After boarding a fleet, the spy moves with the fleet during regular movement.
A spy may not debark from a fleet awaiting retreat (e.g. if a fleet carrying
a spy is dislodged in Spring, the spy may not debark until the spy movement
season following the standard Summer retreat season).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) Spy Mortality

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) This rule will outline the circumstances under which spies may be
captured or killed.  Spies may be disbanded in Winter seasons at the same
time as other units to meet the requirement that a power may not have more
spies than the number of currently held home supply centers and spies are
annihilated when they are on board a fleet that retreats off the board.
Otherwise, spies may only be removed from the board (there is no difference
in the game between capturing and killing a spy, but players should feel
free to delineate between the two states in writing press) immediately
following the four spy movement seasons.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Spies killed or captured in a given season do not submit written
spy reports for that season, though their final movement may have been
made conditional on that spy report.  Players may never know for sure how
a spy was lost, just as in real life.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Spies are "killed" by being assassinated by other spies.  When a
spy moves, he or she may attempt an assassination, specifying the nationality
of spies to be executed if discovered.  Each spy may hunt for only one
nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
will govern the adjudication of assassinations:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) A spy may attempt an assassination without moving (for instance
if the target is in the same province).  In this case, any spies of the target
nationality that end the spy movement phase in that province are assassinated
with one exception.  If the spy attempting the stationary assassination is
himself or herself assassinated by a moving assassin then that spy
assassinates no one in that season (not even a potential target other than the
one that assassinates that spy).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) A spy attempting a moving assassination (may include a move of
embarkation or debarkation from a fleet) is always successful in assassinating
spies of the target nationality that finish the spy movement phase in the
province that the spy moves to.  This makes "mutual assassinations" possible.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Example: French spy is on board a French fleet in the Channel.
An English spy is in London.  Both powers specify assassination attempts
against the spies of the other.  If the English spy embarks on the French
fleet in the channel (remember that embarkation does not require the
permission of the fleet being boarded) and the French spy doesn't move, the
French spy is killed, but the English spy isn't (he may be immediateIy
captured, however, see part D).  If a German spy is also on board and the
French spy tried to assassinate the German spy, that operation would fail
as well. If the French spy debarks to London at the same time, the two spies
"pass in the night" and neither is killed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) Spies are "captured" by opposing armies and fleets.  Players may
attempt to capture spies, specifying the nationality of spies to be captured
if discovered.  Each army and fleet on the board may search for spies of one
nationality in each of the four seasons.  The following rules and examples
will govern the adjudication of attempts to capture spies:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Players may specify a nationality to be hunted separately for
each unit or they may issue blanket searches to be applied to all units.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) At the end of the spy movement phase, any spies of the
nationality specified in the same province are captured (for example, if
the French player specifies a hunt for English spies on their Channel fleet
in the above example, then the English spy is captured).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Players are informed when they successfully capture an opposing
spy.  Note that the &#246;wner" of the spy, however, is not informed of the
capture.  Communication just is cut.  This rule is the only exception to the
generaI rule that armies and fleets are blind.  It is possible to play the
game without allowing capture of spies by armies and fleets if one wishes
to allow freer movement of spies (i.e. RuIe D may be ignored).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7) It is suggested that the game be adjudicated in four separate seasons
in the following order:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     A) Spring: (for Spring 1901 this sequence is preceded by a spy movement
phase (no spy reports are necessary) followed by assassinations or captures)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard movement by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     B) Summer:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard retreats by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     C) Fall:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard movement by fleets and armies, adjudication reported
only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     D) Winter:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          a) Standard Autumn retreats by fleets and armies, adjudication
reported only for one's own units

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          b) Standard Winter builds and removals, also applies to spies

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          c) Spy report phase, spies collect information

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          d) Spy movement phase, spies move according to Rule 4

<div class="p"><!----></div>
          e) Spy assassination and capture phase

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The printed issue arrived today, so there shouldn't be too much trouble for
folks in getting their orders in (presuming they read the issue and see the
deadline). If so, I'll hold the game until the next deadline and just have
commentary (presuming you don't mind my doing that!).
<i>((No, I think people have been enjoying your commentary, I really
liked your review of "The Illusionist"!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks for the kind words about "By The WAY". I'm trying to keep up with
you!
In reading the Spy Dip rules, I've some questions:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rule 4 and 5 - though not stated explicitly, I presume spies on fleets (at
sea) give reports similar to a spy on a land province. [[from one
viewpoint, it makes sense to give the reports; but from another (you're at
sea and have limited contact with your information gathering network), it
doesn't]]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, the spies report the same way.  I had three ideas that led me to that
solution in building the rules.  First, he's a spy on a fleet of ships, he
is presumed to be spying on what the fleet captain and crew knows about 
what is around.  
The spy might pose as a cook or something on a tanker ship.
Second, practical, I didn't want to make the rules too 
complicated around the fleets with spies.  And third, it is a tradeoff,
the spy gets "carted around by the fleet" in ways that the spy might not
choose, so in return it gets to look.  I wanted spies on fleets to be a 
fun thing to do.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rule 5Cc - from reading this, since spies can be carried by fleets of any
power and "permission to board" is not required, you can sneak aboard an
enemy fleet and ride it around whether the owner wants you to or not.
Correct? I did note Rule 6D about capturing them. [[from the game's side,
it makes sense; from a real-world aspect - how can someone really sneak on
a naval fleet without being noticed]]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((See above, that's absolutely right!!  The idea of capturing them is that
you hunt around for Frenchmen and capture people who speak French....
on the sneaking on a fleet, I was thinking a bit more earlier nineteenth
century when you have crews that are brought in.  
My wife and I love the Patrick O'Brien novels with Aubrey and Maturin.
But also the idea that
a fleet has support ships that need cooks and cleaners and people like
that.  The spy doesn't need to be on the flagship, perhaps he is on
the coal tender shoveling coal.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rule 5Cc clarification - as spies may not move from a fleet "in retreat"
and as the spy movement phase is before "Autumn" retreats, a spy on a fleet
dislodged in Fall is stuck on it until after the Winter adjustments are
completed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((That is precisely correct.  And indeed the Spy is at risk of being 
disbanded!
That isn't especially realistic, I know, when you disband a fleet, presumably
one wouldn't just sink it with all hands (including spies) aboard, but I 
don't believe in pure realism in rules, the variant plays better this way.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I take it that it this will be a regular game (all players known). If you
have a Press-Gunboat game in the future, keep me in mind.

<i>((Absolutely, this will be a regular game, I don't do Gunboat, so you'll
have to look elsewhere for that.
Ordinarily, I wouldn't print such a statement, since it might give a hint for
a game, but I mean I ***NEVER*** do Gunboat..... I really do have an objection
to it as a variant.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1.A wing unit can move over both land and water spaces. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2.A wing unit can support actions in any space adjacent to the one it occupies. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3.A wing can give, receive and cut support in the same way as armies and fleets. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4.A wing unit cannot convoy or be convoyed. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5.A wing unit cannot capture an SC, but instead blockades it: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 5.1.A blockade occurs when a wing unit occupies the SC of 
another player in a fall season. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 5.2.The player who owns a blockaded SC does not count 
it when counting his total number of SCs. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 5.3.A blockade ends as soon as the wing unit no longer occupies the SC. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 5.4.Builds only take place in the winter phase, just as in games without wings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Welcome to our newest regular Dip game.
David is my brother, but I've decided to let him play here after debating it back 
and forth for awhile.
You can see how unbiased I can be to start as he ended up with Austria in the 
Random Draw, and there he stays.
John Crow and Drew James are returning after relatively long absences from the
Dip Scene, welcome back!!!
Jeff, Don, and Fred have been in lots of games here recently.
And Marc is a recipient of one of the Phil Reynolds memorial slots.
I thought it would be a good tribute to name this the Phil Reynolds Memorial.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note the 2006B Boardman Number above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) John Crow and Jeff O'Donnell are NOT on-line, I don't believe.  But both enjoy
getting cell phone calls about the game, I believe.
Otherwise, you'll have to work out your own ways of communicating.
I think I have all the relevant contact information filled in above.
I do have lots of the orders in hand, with this delay, you'll have a few
more weeks to interact.
I fixed my brother David's E-Mail address, which I got wrong - of course.

I really screwed up!
The Cardassians did not attack and have signed a peace agreement but the 
Starship Excelsior is now desperately out of position.
Everyone seems to be attacking everyone, I hope our reconciliation
with Cardassia holds...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF-WORLD): As if the economic situation was not bad enough with
Ford reorganizing and the price of oil, comes news from the 
International Astronomical Society that the planet Pluto is
being laid off.
This news comes at a bad time for the Bush administration
as it was being considered an alterntative location
for the prisoners at Guantanimo Bay.
When asked to comment, Pluto was quoted as saying, "I'm no
longer a planet but I've had a great run.
I've been declared the largest ice sculpture in the galaxy.
My advisors say that although my days as a planet are done,
I can still try to find a new career by running for Senator
of the State of New York.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB OPINES): Excelsior, indeed!!!
And you think New York State needs more Carpetbaggers?
Note the groaner triple entendres on both sides....
I don't think we need to feel sorry for Pluto since, as we all know,
this means EVEN greater fame and fortune for Pluto as the planet
that is no more.
Can Venus or Mercury say the same???
Besides, Pluto is the god of death and the underworld, we should never
have let him see the light of day in the first place.
Yet more evidence that baby boomers are continuing their fantastical campaign
to abolish death, Woody Allen excepted.
Well, it won't work, gosh darn it, they're ALL going to die in the end.
Really.
As an economist, what I will find most interesting about the Ford
buyouts (which will precede any layoffs) is how workers respond to the
three choices they face:
(1) Take a lower financial buyout and keep their medical care [this will
be people who have the largest aversions to risk AND think about the 
future rationally]; (2) Take the higher financial buyout and give up
their medical care [these will be the people that traditional economists
call irrational, but really are just expressing that large amount of 
impatience that is growing in our population and confounding the 
economists who thought that we got more patient as we got older and
more educated... not this group, and that's rational if that's what
they really want - we can't be bailing them out later when the
consequences of their choices come back to bite them in the butt!];
or (3) Take the risk of staying on and seeing if they are laid off
later, the risk includes the strong possibility that they will be
moved to another location 
(believe you me, some of my brother and sister economists will be
studying the wonderful natural experiment, I'll report back later).

1) Lots of press, lots of changes, what now for this game year???
No draw proposals yet, that's for sure.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-PETTY DICTATOR (UNCLE JEFFY POOH)): Laughing out loud. I still can't 
believe that it took so long for you to realize that was me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN to BOARD): If you do write me to get hold of Jeff, so he resembles 
having an e-mail please make sure to put the game name in the subject line. 
Thanks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to WORLD): Not only is Jim's brother David very welcome 
to the Phil Reynolds game, I'm confused why anyone would comment
about possible conflict of interest in this situation or when I'm
in any game with my nephew Sean.
There is no conflict of interest because there is no real money involved.
My feeling is that Jim could add his own name 
<i>((It would be REALLY hard for me to GM a game and play in at the
same time, not COMPLETELY impossible, but really hard.))</i>
or the names of any number
of friends, and or relatives and I'd be happy to play, in fact, 
I don't think who is playing should be a factor in the decision
to ro not to play.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DARTH VADER to DARTH SIDIUS): Sooner or later, we will finish this in the 
traditions of the Sith as Apprentice kills their master for supremacy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIAN UNDERGROUND to ENGLAND): What happened?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIAN O'DONNELL-RUSSIAN O'DONNELL): Russia sucks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS): Captain's Log "Hopeful".
We thought we were all dead, instead we ahve withour Ferengi allies achieved
a major victory over the Romulans.
We are commissioning a new troop transport and our Ferengi allies are 
adding to their force.
The Romulans have been forced to decommission two unknown ships.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Spock to Captain Kirk. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Report.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: I have interesting news.
Our Ferengi allies are not rally Ferengi after all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Really!
I thought we changed them from Federation to Ferengi!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: So did I, but our victory over the Romulans revealed prison exchanges
that showed them to be Andorian.
The Andorians were aided by an unknown alien group currently at war with
the Children of Tomari.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: The Tomarians scare me.
Agreed, but for the moment all we cna hope is that they don't engage us...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD): My guess for England's removals. R F Bel and R F Ech. My second 
choice is R F Por and R F Bel. Note if it's not my first choice. I guess 
wrong.....
<i>((You're pretty close to completely wrong.... you're not inside Karl's head.
I hope that isn't what your Uncle was assuming...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to WORLD): France is building!
This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-PETTY DICTATOR PART 2): What can I say? You taught me well. Did you 
not teach me when in doubt attack your enemy or something? Didn't you also 
teach me that when you are losing attempt to obliterate units even though I 
do try to do that while I'm winning to. Didn't you also teach me to the best 
of your ability that this is a game of deception; therefore, words are 
meaningless? Finally, didn't you teach me to always woot for myself? (I 
don't recall needing a mentor there.) Oh, there is one more thing that you 
taught me. I'll tell you what. I give you my word as a Diplomacy player that 
I will not encourage Karl (England) of Flip Flop to wipe you out, and I 
further give my word as a Diplomacy player not to encourage anyone else to 
attack the Petty Dicator.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to SEAN): It doesn't matter that I'm Russia in Phil Reynolds, Russia 
still sucks!
(Deal with it!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-THE BOARD): Attack France!
<i>((Sean, if I don't print this now, I'm going to misplace it, so I think
we'll go with it here.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FLIP FLOP ENDGAME STATEMENT RUSSIA):
I have to start by saying congratulations to a game well played. I made 
a couple of mistakes. Has anyone seen the movie Zulu? It's essentially what I 
did. I went out to meet the loins and got carved up. My other major mistake 
was not managing a peace in the southern border. My third mistake  
coincides with the first. I should have allied with Germany opposed to 
putting everything into being able to steal England as an ally from France. 
It was fun though learning the lesson that I should have known all along.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My strategy was to form an E/R/T without directly forming a triple 
alliance. I wanted to form R/T to have a strong alliance even though I 
shouldn't have made the mistake of not really trying to allow Austria into 
the alliance. I tried discouraging this triple which may have been yet 
another mistake. What can I say, I didn't play that alliance very well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My strategy was based on trying to anticipate what Jeff was planning. In 
a one on one game with Jeff (France) I know that R/T and E/F is an even 
counter alliance unless Turkey's standard build included F Smy opposed to 
Ank, or France starts with a fleet in Mar.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I figured France would be encouraging a E/F alliance, so I should 
encourage a counter alliance, but I misscalculated how to handle my southern 
borders wanting a R/A/T alliance. Since I openly opposed the alliance with 
Turkey, I'd have to say that's my second largest mistake. It's most likely 
what encouraged wiping me out even though I did try getting Austria to fight 
Germany and Italy. This would have allowed Turkey into a dominant naval 
policy and hopefully reach the Mid stalemate line with all possible speed. 
Neither strategy here worked. Meanwhile, English and Russian diplomacy 
apparently broke down. I was counting on being able to steal England away 
from France, and I wanted to begin negotiations in this regard before 
England was fully engaged with Germany. What I had in mind was blitz 
Germany, and aid England into France while A/T batters Italy and I'm able to 
breach the Germany stalemate line. I focused on the attempt to get England 
to attack France after Germany fell even though I wasn't asking for 
anything. Being the largest starting power, I thought if need be the offer 
of France likely Spa, Por, Par, Bre, Bel, and Mar. England didn't engage 
Germany as I hoped. I offered Stp as a peace offering, but I neglecting my 
southern border trying to gain England against France, and A/T launched an 
offensive against Russia inevitably leaving me with every border hostile to 
Russia. This left me allyless and going down. My strategy to counter and 
destroy E/F inevitably failed. Russia fell not long later.
Maybe, I'll have better luck in the next game. Good game.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The GAFT draw proposal is defeated and amazingly, the GA-GA sallies forth again.
If you have finally become GA-GA over this game, vote yes to this with your Winter
orders.
If you fail to vote, as usual, you veto the proposal.
Oh wait, we also have the GAFT reproposed, you can vote on that with the same restrictions.
People occasionally ask me what happens if two draws pass, it always is the SMALLER draw
that is the final result when that happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I did talk to Vern, and he submitted orders for the other game, but he didn't submit
orders here. 
So all his units hold, but I can't believe he wants to walk away from the game.
As always, though, even though I'm not calling a standby now, he has to get orders
in for Winter, and his build, or else I will replace him.
