For Faxing, most of the time you have to call me to tell me it's coming

my ISP's spam protection, if that happens to you, you can use my backup E-Mail

instant replies.  Lastly, for intro stuff, SOMEONE on the <i>TAP</i> E-Mail
list (tap of diplom.org) has a particularly nasty computer virus infection.
I suspect it is a <i>Tinamou</i> player (note that <i>Tinamou</i> should just
make it in here, along with a <i>Diversions</i> from Rip Gooch) since Dave
Partridge and I seem to be getting particularly flooded with mails, both as
"purported sender" and "recipient".

<br /><br />"Deception, double-crosses, back-stabbing.... It's not that the
passionate enthusiasts who gather around the Diplomacy board can't
handle the truth.
They just don't care to."
Blake Eskin from his <i>Washington Post</i> feature magazine article "World
Domination: the Game" in the Sunday, November 14th, Page W16 paper.
You may find it online at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A381102004Nov9.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I hope to heck I typed that right, and you will of course need to "register"
with the Post to view it.
Andy Marshall really IS Satan and Tom Pasko really IS Bad Tom..... and that's
how this review of this August's "Tempest in a Teapot", the Pitkissers
annual tournament (formally, the Potomac Tea and Knife Society) in its
last year at the World Boardgaming Championships in Hunt Valley began.
One slight annoyance, is that there is no mention of next year's World
DipCon, and one might begin to get a little nervous about what gyrations
the PTKS crew is going through as the WBC heads off to Pennsylvania and
abandons them.
It is DAMNED hard to organize a tournament and negotiate with hotels
from scratch and I sympathize with you guys.
But, for the present, this article is a piece of genius.
Blake Eskin is a gifted writer, and of course a self-acknowledged poor
Diplomacy player, but this is EASILY the best newspaper article on THE
GAME I've ever seen (and I've recently received from Allan Calhamer a
treasured gift of copies of Allan's clipped newspaper articles about 
THE GAME, so I have a recent large inventory of context).
Speaking of the Great Originator, Eskin's brief five paragraph PLUS history
of Allan B. Calhamer is again noteworthy for what each of us can learn
from this article.
I don't think I'd ever heard the story that Calhamer told Eskin that the
first playtest was conducted with players scribbling notes and passing
them at the board.
Calhamer says, "So after that, we just talked face-to-face.
That was a tremendous improvement."
Well, duh!
But not altogether obvious and remains distinctive in Diplomacy over almost
all other games, that "social wandering around the board".
Nathan Barnes, Tom Kobrin, Steve Koehler, David Hood, Jim Yerkey, John
Boardman, they're all in there.
This is a must read.
Thanks Andy, or should I say SATAN!!!!
Great job getting this article out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you may be aware that Tom Howell, and his szine <i>off-the-shelf</i>
have been missing from cyberspace for quite some time now.
Except for the phone calls from Dave Partridge and me for Breaking Away
bike race orders (Note: Another <i>Tinamou</i> is here in this very issue)
I gather he has been completely out of touch for about four months now.
He had some very large Internet connection and computer hard drive problems,
and for awhile he was accessing some of his E-Mail from the public library,
but I gather he's even stopped doing that.
If you are player or subber to <i>o-t-s</i> consider yourself notified of the
situation, which still is a "no idea when it will come back".  
If you know any other players or subbers who AREN'T subbers here (that includes
you, Tom, since at least you see the paper version of this) who need to know
this, please let them know.
Thanks, and here's to hoping Tom returns to us soon!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Lastly, in upfront stuff, the election IS over and the winner is clearer than
in 2000, though these are by far the two closest elections in a row in a 
long, long, long time.
I don't want to say a lot, you can see what Dave Partridge has to say in his
subszine and we agree about most of what he says, but I do want to say this.
I think you have to grant that the deciding factor in this election WAS the 
apathetic vote, the people who really didn't care about the issues, or the
discussion, or the politics, or the ads, or the debates.
These people were clearly the so-called median voter in each state, the people
who decided the election.
The apathetic are apathetic about all of these cultural issues which pundits
are trying to argue decided the election.
They are NOT fundamentalist Christians, or fundamental about anything, they
are regular Joe's, trying to raise families, work hard, drink beer on the
weekends, and MAYBE (though this is probably even a stretch) watch NASCAR.
Some of them are smart, some are less smart, but what they share is a TOTAL
lack of interest in participatory democracy.
But they were dragged out to vote this year by hype and pushing, and once
dragged out, they decided it between two evenly split groups of more passionate
partisans.
This was a classic H.L. Mencken election, about the worst of democracy when
more or less uninformed, dispassionate voters decide things (and see last
issue's editorial on how I think they decided).
If you think carefully about what I'm saying, I think you will see at least
part of the truth in it.
What is clear, though, is that George Bush knows how to speak to these people,
clearly and plainly, and very few other people can in an election format.
It is important to note, he didn't really get them to "share his values",
they just got him to vote for him and his leadership style.
In another situation, that might not decide an election, but it decided this one.
There is no way that Kerry could have grabbed these people's attention, almost
by definition.
They aren't bad people, or unpleasant people, they just don't care enough to
do the work of paying attention to political issues.
And why should they?
Really, why should they?
From their perspective, none of it really matters, as much as the passionates
believe that it matters to them (and it does).
That's what's really scary, and it should scare both sides of what the pundits
call this "divided nation".
At least I think so, unless sleeping tight America IS the right way to go on.

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JOHN SMYTHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm about to start putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, starting
with someone who SHOULD be relatively easy to find, since he's been "around"
in recent years, and then working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
So, let's really find John, I'll be shocked if you can't do it, and
it's worth fifty bucks!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Map Collection, ERC Library, University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
That's a relatively new address adjustment.

Dear Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For games of Puerto Rico, I recommend <i>FWTWR</i> (Keith Thomasson's website)
www.fwtwr.com/fwtwr/
<i>((Or the companion paper <b>For Whom the Die Rolls</b> szine... both of
which I recommend highly.))</i>
Keith charges <i>$</i>1 per game played.
Alternatively, we also play using Cyberboard on the Psychopath website - by
Mike Dean.
<i>((Sorry, Mike, but since I stopped playing on Psychopath, and without an
update, I haven't looked at the site in many months, but Bruce prompted me to
do so, I enjoyed the photos of PsychoCon....))</i>
No charge to play here - see www.psychozine.co.uk
Maybe Steve could E-Mail you the board so you could set up your own group?
I believe there is another on-line Puerto Rico site but haven't found it yet.
New game out recently is "St. Petersburg" and if you like Puerto Rico,
it's definitely worth looking at this one too.
Not as long a game, but fun all the same.

2005 DIPCON DIP AT SEA UPDATE</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Greetings One and All!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hopefully this will get through to all of you. Please feel free to pass it on to
hobby members or others you think might be interested.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, The Dip At Sea cruise event is alive and well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Second, I'm also alive, but perhaps not quite as well.  As some of you know I 
had a serious car accident in August.  Serves me right for going to see 
Fahrenheit 9/11 on a full stomach.  Fortunately I was driving an American 
made car, wearing my seat belt, and the air bags worked.  Otherwise, Edi 
would be writing this e-mail.  Unfortunately, my recovery hasn't been as 
speedy as I would have liked. Since I couldn't deal with the steps 
where I was living I had to move and that didn't help matters. 
Anyway, that's mostly behind me.  I'm still in a considerable
amount of pain but I refuse to use the pain killers, etc. the 
doctors say I should take.  Let's tough this one out!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here is my new contact information:
Larry Peery, 3160 Buena Hills Dr., Oceanside, CA 92056, USA;
Phone number: 760-966-1045 (fax number will be the same);
No change in email, etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Third, as for Dip at Sea registration, etc. I ask that you all help by 
keeping this as simple as possible.  As Mr. Korbin would say, 
"time is of the essence."
First, checkout the Dip At Sea web site at http://www.ry4an.org/dipatsea 
and either email it to me or post a copy to me with your registration 
fee (USD please).
The main thing is to let me know you are registering for the Con.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fourth, Register for the cruise!  You and anybody coming with you must 
do this and you should do it soon to get the best price on the best 
cabin you can. I had
hoped we would do this as a group which would allow us 
to save a considerable amount of money, etc.  
But there are those who want to make their own arrangements. 
Here are your options.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Do it yourself. You can do your own internet research, etc. and 
book your cruise online, on the phone, etc. through Carnival.  
Read the web site carefully so you understand what you will 
need to do to do that. Also check out Carnival's
web site and see what their requirements are. 
If you pick this alternative, please do not expect us 
to guarantee your arrangements, etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Do it through me.  If you want me to make your arrangements I will, 
using a qualified travel agent, etc. This will help the group get 
the best rate. And we will stand behind your efforts.  
Email me if this is your desire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Do it through your own travel agent. Again, you're on your own, but at least
your agent is behind you. Suggested for those using FFM, etc.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The main thing is to let me know ASAP if you are coming and if you are 
traveling with your family or friends.  Or, if you are traveling solo 
but want a roomie for the cruise, let me know that, and I'll try to 
find you one. No guarantees on it. 
It's much better if you find yourself one and have that info when you go
to sign up for the cruise. Don't expect the cruise line to match you up with a
roomie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fifth, don't worry about the hurricanes of the season just past.  
None of them affected our ports of call and our cruise will not 
take place during the hurricane season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect to have another email out on Friday in response to 
some of those I have received in the past few weeks. 
In the meantime, the Dip At Sea website should be updated by then.

Tomorrow is election day. I urge you all to go out and vote. It may be the most
important election of your lifetimes.  Why I remember when Mr. Truman ran.....

<i>((Hey, Larry, I hope you're feeling better.
I'm glad you finally resurfaced, as Edi Birsan and I and others
had been trying to track you down for a few weeks.
I do NOT have any updated information from two weeks ago
or any further E-Mails from Larry, but I'm not going to be
able to go, so I may not be at the top of the communication list.
Still, many of you may not have even seen the above note.
My own story, put simply, is that this does happen to be Spring Break
for one of my jobs, but especially with the election turning out
as it did, for my other job, this period of time is going to be
totally nuts, and I will need that break to work on federal gov't
things.
Plus, my wife's school spring break does NOT coincide with this and 
she said she would basically kill me if I went on my first cruise
(since I've not been a font of positive statements about cruises in the
past) without her.
So, I'm out, but on the plus side, I should be able to negotiate an 
appearance at Manorcon if the dates DO turn out to be the early 
July 15-18 dates (still not resolved on the ManorCon web page at this
writing).
Plus, we need to get a deal going for the third annual 
Boston Massacre in June!!  
Plan to come up here and join us for that.))</i>

<br /><br />Tim Snyder (tsnyder of opii point mccombs point utexas point edu) is starting
up <i>Zine Register</i> again.  He thinks this next issue will be #30, I think
that might be right.  Write to Tim at 12001 Dessau Road, #825, Austin, TX  78754
by November 30, so he can finish by the end of the year.
I always salute someone picking up a languishing project.
It will be good to see how many szines he counts out there, I'm not sure how
many really are left, I am trading with less than half a dozen in the US that
are regularly producing issues, plus <i>Northern Flame</i> in Canada.

<b>MUSIC AND MOVIES SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tell me anything you like about the recent past in music.
List a top two, a top ten, or a top 100, I don't care, just tell me something!!
We're beginning to gear up for a "best of 2004" section.
Let me give you a couple of tidbit previews, not sure if all of these will make
my best list, but these are the new records I'm listening to right now.....
I've been taking a little foray again, as I do periodically, into music from
countries other than the major Western democracies.
I am NOT an expert in this stuff, but two records I've had for awhile
that are this year's are Charlie Gillett from the BBC's latest compilation,
<i>World 2004</i>.  It is getting wildly mixed reviews, I heard part of a relatively
raving positive NPR review the other day, but I've also heard some bad reviews too.
I think NPR regularly does a rave review of this series each year.
I also own <i>World 2003</i>, which I think is better, but I'm still listening
to both - I would note that given the amazingly wide range of music on these
compilations, making any sort of general judgment is well nigh impossible.
Recommended more unreservedly if you want to listen to something different
from what you've likely heard before, Zap Mama has a new two-disc set entitled
<i>Ancestry in Progress</i> which amalgamates a silky soul smoothness with a
distinctly African base.
I hunted out this record partly to find some of the hip-hop that I'd heard that
I DID like, to counter Al Tabor's comment recently here in <i>TAP</i>.  
My favorite tune on the record, which I'm listening to right now is 
"Bandy Bandy" with guest singer Erykah Badu wailing over the top of the sound.
I think "Bandy" is a snake, at least that's what the music sounds like.
A few of the other songs, remember this is a 2 CD set, wander around a bit too long,
or fall back into more standard boring hip-hop formats
(e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;is there ANY more overused theme than earth, air, fire, and water elementals?).
But mostly this vehicle for Marie Daulne takes off and soars.
It's a good cure for those struggling for acceptance and calm in the face of 
a maddeningly angry world, and don't we all need that right now?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And for something COMPLETELY different, Alan Parsons has a new record, did any
of you know that?
You can tell listening to it, that he intends it to follow up on that DVD
of the making of Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, which I hear is
wonderful.
I think this, too, is going to be a DVD.
It harkens back to space music of the 1970's and 1980's like I've not heard
made new in a long, long, long time, but yes, it brings visions of Tangerine
Dream and Klaus Schulze.
If you don't know what that is, you likely would not "get" <i>A Valid Path</i>.
This doesn't even touch classic Schulze, who remains the touchstone in this genre.
And some of it.... well, maybe you have to see the visuals.
So, uneven record, probably won't make my tops of 2004 but well worth noting.
And I might warm up more to it as a whole, maybe after I get the DVD, if I do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still keep a toe in looking at some of the bands who might push us out of 
some of the doldrums and I watch VERY lightly some of the British band scenes.....
and in Liverpool the best house local band there for some time has been Clinic.
Their music has been interesting, probably most interesting to those who've
seen Clinic live in Liverpool or elsewhere in England.
And Liverpool has a good history of starting BIG trends, doesn't it??
But their latest, <i>Winchester Cathedral</i> is of some considerable note.
They might be about to break out.
It has three characteristics that make me say that.
First, WOW, it actually is an ALBUM!!!
There are 12 songs on the album, and you actually want to play it straight through
(like on the single CD player I have here in my home office) rather than on random
in the main 5 CD changer in the Music Room downstairs.
Secondly, the best song in the album, with a LOT of stretch in it, is "Falstaff",
which doesn't sound anything like any Shakespearean Falstaff I could imagine.
Here in town, the local theatre company is doing the Henriad cycle, plus they did
"Merry Wives of Windsor" in the spring..... well that is really just a digression.
But anyway "Falstaff" is buried as the ninth song on the album, and from the first
insistent sounds of the first cut "Country Mile" it builds up to a peak at 
"Falstaff" and then closes out with this insistent piano bouncing on "Fingers"
that takes you away bouncing....
And third, they just finished up a major US tour, and thus should start to get some
attention over here, since I hear their live shows are fantastic.  They didn't
come to Providence, and I don't get out to too many live shows these days anyway.
I hear that Clinic BIG fans, who liked the rough jangly garagy nervousness of their
earlier output, didn't/don't like this one so much.
I entirely disagree, check this out if you think you want to see where good band
music might be headed in the next few years.
Let's get back to some REAL albums!!!  
He says, without trying to be at ALL doctrinaire rockist..... really.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another way to develop an album is to look at Movie Soundtracks, which
seem to be some of the best "albums" many years recently.
Another of these, showing Zach Braff to really have some true multi-talents,
is the soundtrack to <i>Garden State</i>.  
Zach Braff stars in the archly funny TV comedy <i>Scrubs</i> which I usually
find pretty hilarious, on the rare times when I see it, since I'm a "rare
and no pay attention to schedule" TV watcher.
He's the Executive Soundtrack Producer (as well as lots of other things on the
movie that I've not seen yet, but will eventually) and pulls in a few "stars"
like Coldplay who then provide the weakest tracks on the album to sell it.
Coldplay leads off with the somewhat lifeless "Don't Panic" off a record of theirs
from five years ago or so.
Most of the cuts actually are NOT new 2004 cuts, what is neat is their assembly
and ordering, not a dance tracking DJ thing, but a silky smooth DJ thing.
The Shins contibute two stellar 2001 cuts "Caring Is Creepy" and "New Slang" that
sandwich another 2001 song that I'd never heard before by Zero 7 called "In the
Waiting Line", which was worth the whole CD for me.
This is soft and lilting for the most part, rather than grabbing pounding rock.
And of course there is the obligatory Nick Drake cut ("One of These Things First")
with that absolutely cut through the junk voice, a little bit breathy, a little bit
tremulous, but steady on.
Parts of it also call to mind a bit of Cornershop (who could have been in here if
I was making the decisions) with a band I'd never heard of called Thievery Corporation
("Lebanese Blonde") offering a bit of an Indian/Middle Eastern sensibility.
And I've not heard "The Only Living Boy in New York" by Simon and Garfunkel for
thirty years, wow, it sounds good here.
It ends up with a song that I think WAS written for the soundtrack (there is a picture
from the movie of a motorcycle/side car driving through the rain that appears to be
suggested by this song), "Winding Road" by a singer I'd not heard of named Bonnie
Somerville.
She's someone I'll watch out for though.
Pleasant, folky, with some grounded gravel in the voice, and good backgrounds....
yeah, that's the best soundtrack I've heard this year, any other nominees?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sticking a bit folky, you know some of the golden oldies who aren't up high on the
radar screen tend to just get ignored.
I'd not bought a Roches album in at least ten years, but something drew me to 
<i>Why the Long Face?</i> and wow, I'm damned glad it did.
This is really a stunning record by Suzzy and Maggie Roche by two folk pros who know
just how to write, produce, and perform a record with just the right judicious use
of covers.
In particular "I Don't Have You" by someone named Mark Johnson (pretty unknown, 
I think) leads it off, and it ends up with Brian Wilson's (and Jack Rieley's)
Beach Boys lament over trees and smog, "A Day in the Life of a Tree".
It's interpretation, and wowsie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While we're in the past, two other notables, the Talking Heads live album <i>The
Name of This Band is Talking Heads</i> is out on CD with all sorts of add-ons to get
up to 33 songs.
For all Heads heads like me, this is pretty essential.
I remember that Scott Hanson, among others, used to get on me about the Talking
Heads, I'm not sure if Scottie is still watching <i>TAP</i> on the Internet, but
if he is.... well, tough, skip this one.
I will say that with some distance, the Disc 1 (1977-1979) is WAY better and stands
up much better than Disc 2 (1980-1981).  With the exception of songs like
"Houses in Motion" and "Take Me to the River" (which is infinitely better in
the live version) Disc 2 has too much of that Brian Eno/African beat
combination sounds that haven't been fully integrated into the songs.
The Talking Heads did become more effective at doing this eventually.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And lastly, note that I maintain a Mark Cutler quote at the head of the games
section.
Mark's first band was called the Schemers, and from 1978-1986, it was perhaps
the best heir to Jonathan Richman's Modern Lovers that ever existed, and the
best rock band that my local state of Rhode Island ever produced.
Back from the grave, a memory album called <i>Remember</i> is out.
It will (guaranteed) be one of my top albums of the year, and I'll
give you a full review then, but go check out Mark Cutler's web site
at http://www.mcutler.com for more, or you can order it at band mate
Emerson Torrey's site: http://www.emersontorrey.com/index.cfm?sec=stuff
I spent a lotta, lotta hours listening to and dancing to this music and
I'm overjoyed that I finally have it on CD.
You can too.
You WILL smile, laugh, and dance if you listen to it.
Smart, inclusive rock that only Rhode Island could produce.

Bruce Linsey's 2004 Presidential Pool Results</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You all may recall that I offered entry into Bruce's contest earlier this year.
By my count, there were nine of the thirty entries (some were multiple, since
multiple entries were allowed) from <i>TAP</i> subbers.  
We did well though, with four of the top ten entries coming from our readers.
You can ask Bruce by E-Mail or self-addressed stamped envelope if you want
to see all the results, I'm just going to summarize the Top 10.
We were trying to guess the electoral counts by state as they fell to
each candidate.  Putting in our entries by the end of July gave us 30 extra
points, August 20 points, September 10 points, and by the end of October none.  
(Bruce didn't like the time bonus, but I was more bothered by the 
ability to enter the pool multiple
times)  And finally, technically New Mexico's electoral votes are still up
for grabs, as I think Bush has about a 6000 vote lead, but Kerry has conceded
it, and I think that supports leaving it in Bush's column in tallying results.
Randy Cox submitted four separate entries, all with the 30 point bonus, his
average of the four was around 503, but his second entry won the contest
with 561.  And his third entry was second with 538.
I think Richard Moore's entry was the most impressive, finishing third with
only a 20 point bonus at 537.  Richard got the key big battleground states of
Florida and Ohio for Bush and Pennsylvania for Kerry (as did both of Randy's 
higher entries).
I did better on a lot of the smaller states, but blew Florida, predicting it would 
go to Kerry.
Our own Andy York finished fourth (congratulations, Andy!) with 531 (also with the
20 point bonus).
In fifth, by my reckoning, John McGinley had one of his two entries also with 531
points, breaking the tie by Andy only submitting one entry.
I finished sixth with 530 with the big misses of New Mexico (eventually turned out to
be the closed state) and the aforementioned Florida, but I got almost everything
else right (I think Arkansas was the only other one I missed, and I also submitted
early enough to get the 30 point bonus).
Seventh was Steve Nozik (529), and eighth was our own Phil Reynolds at 525.
Phil also missed Florida, his own home state!
And he used the 30 point bonus, but got smaller states
like New Hampshire wrong.
Our best political wizard, Mark Lew, waited until the end (no bonus points) and
finished ninth with 519 (he did make TWO entries though, and the other one only
had 479).  
In his ninth finishing entry he was the only one to split Maine predicting that
one congressional district would go to Bush (which didn't happen), and got all
the big states right.
Some of the smaller states he got wrong were New Mexico, Wisconsin, and that
one vote in Maine, still he would have finished second without the bonus structure
that Bruce says he isn't going to use again.
To finish out the Top 10, Steve Atkins had 515 points.
Bruce had 495 points with his big miss being Illinois for Bush.
I studied early state polls and liked the bonus system for that reason.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Well, look at that, anyone surprised?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HEY JIM): How am I supposed to write "credible" Star Trek press without the use of
the ever-suffering Boston Red Sox fan or the Curse of the Bambino.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB EXULTS): You're on your own, sucker!
That's your problem if you need the crutch of an 86 year old curse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I'm an Indians fan, but I always like the Red Sox because of
Carl Yastremski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, and Fenway Park.
Having said that I must confess that at the point where the Sox were up 3 games 
to zero, there was a part of me hoping they'd blow 4 games to continue the curse.
Oh well, congratulations to your Sox from a Yankee hating Indians fan.
<i>((Isn't it hard having their Triple A team in Columbus??))</i>
No one can take this one from you; unless of course, none of this is real and
you, me, and Sean are actually on Talos 4.... oh well I can always do Trek press
on the long suffering Cleveland Indians fans....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): Thanks for the sentiments, they are appreciated.
There of course never was a curse, it just was the way it was.
I recognize why calling it a curse made it more "fun", but IF
they had gone ahead and lost four in a row, thus consecutively
being part of both sides of the only 3-0 to 3-4 losses in playoff
history, I might have admitted that the torture of a Curse might
make sense.
I think it was the Boston sportscaster Clark Boothe who once said
that the Curse was dooming the Red Sox to fail in every possible way,
in every kind of torture, before the Curse could finally be broken.
We all of course imagined a type of torture (losing 4-3 to the Cardinals
after going up 3-0) that didn't happen, and never was going to happen.
The Red Sox just got on SUCH a roll that no one was going to beat them.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
The upcoming Fall 1917 will be two game years by that measure.
Even if Turkey is missing TWO of its home centers in Winter 1917,
I think we are still going to advance to the next level of
voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be
allowed with failure to vote equalling a yes.
If any other significant movement or centers change hands
then that will be another story, of course.
This does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is way ahead of this pace).
