<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />FIRST E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website incorporating all subszines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: /Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />We will have four subszines going forward, from Dave Partridge, Doug Kent, Andy York, and 
Peter Sullivan.  Right now I am delaying making the PDF until Monday since Dave Partridge
is trying to finish <i>Tinamou</i>.  
All the feedback on going web/E-mail only was positive, though of course Fred Davis wants me 
to send it to him.
I also REALLY blew it last time, I made a GMing mistake in the Supply Center count in 
Spirals of Paranoia and forgot to fix it in #320.  I'm fixing it here and delaying
Spring 1908 orders until February 13th.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire szine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once I get the albatross of the failed mailed szines off my back, this can run much faster and
better.
I think I will mostly encourage jfburgess of gmail.com for an E-Mail address, though
burgess of world.std.com still also works.
Let's get back on track and play, or not, let me know if you want out and I'll find
standbies.  Volunteers for that are welcome.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lastly, come play at TempleCon, February 5-7, 2010 that I am hosting right here in Providence,
RI, see http://www.templecon.org/10. I've got a crash room that is yours for whatever you want
to pay, even nothing if you like.  It's not too late to show up, game report in the next issue.
Contact me if you want to come!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As a result, ALL players must be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
I think I have now signed up all the players, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

Jim,
It was great to receive <i>TAP</i> in the mail again.  I had pretty much given up on it.  
You are doing the right thing by eliminating the postal version - too expensive and too much work for you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What a great winter - my Orange are ranked #5 and #1 in the RPI.  
After I send this I'll be on my way to the Dome for Marquette and then again Monday for Georgetown.  
Sorry that your Friars are not having a good year.  The Big East is so tough.  
It is almost impossible for the bottom teams to make a move into the upper half of the conference.  
Even the improved teams such as Seton Hall and St John's still struggle to win games 
given how good the top 6 to 8 teams are year in and year out.

<i>((Yes, I understand the challenge, the task for teams like Providence is to make a move
once every couple of years.
PC did a major tank in losing about a ten point lead to South Florida in the last minute of a 
recent game, took it to overtime and collapsed.
Then they upset UConn, and now are 4-4 in the Big East, and at the edge of the 
top 6-8 teams.  
If they can beat Cincinnati tonight, then they actually will be around 6th or 7th in the league.
After that, they hit the iron of the conference, including two with your Orange, and will 
nearly surely be knocked back, unless center Ray Hall (who has missed nearly two years with
injuries) can fight his way back into the starting lineup.  
PC is too small and weak to take banging from the top teams, though UConn is nothing
if not strong, and they beat them by 15!
An unnamed <b>TAP</b> subber is sitting on a pair of Final Four tickets and I think Syracuse has
to be odds on favorites to be one of those four at this point.  
They have better defense and team play than Boeheim has gotten out of them in many a year.
Syracuse has the talent AND the good team play that can dominate the Big East and also
go on the national stage and win in the Big Dance.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Those of you who have been around here for a long time will recall that I was part of
the 1993 Health Care Reform task force and did a lot of work supporting
the development of the bill.  
And from the inside, I saw it falling apart piece by piece as too much effort was made to
meet the needs of the inside the Beltway Washington bureaucrats and not enough time trying
to build an interest group coalition of support outside.
Today, I'm still part of the external support structure for the Washington bureaucrats,
and this time around, was not really consulted at all.
This was part of the quite reasonable Obama administration strategy NOT to have any 
strongly held policy beliefs and let all the compromises be made that needed to be
made to get to the finish line.
At one point, I laughed hysterically when he said something like, "the parameters of this bill 
completely match what I ran on last year," when the reality of what was produced was
much, much closer to what Hillary Clinton ran on, and had very little of the structure
that the President ran on. 
Instead, they built the coalition of the outside interest groups and let those
groups influence elements of the bill.
Both times, the resulting bill was hugely bloated with provisions and add-ons, but had
very different types of bloating.
Then we saw various provisions track
through the bills to what the House and Senate finally passed. 
And it looked like indeed they would pass... until now they look much more uncertain.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((My take on where all that is, and how we got there, differs from most of the pundits 
I've been hearing, and comes from a different interpretation of the last
two "facts on the table" that brought us to where we are: 
Ben Nelson's deal to get Washington funding for Nebraska's Medicaid program and the 
election of Scott Brown in Massachusetts. 
First, some of what I think are indisputable facts on where all this was going.  
Like the state plan in Massachusetts, the idea was to pass a reform bill that got
more people covered, closed up pre-existing condition clauses and maximum benefit
clauses, and tried to figure out the right mix of expanding Medicaid and providing
subsidies to make health insurance "affordable" (quite a fungible concept).
The big thing intentionally missing was any serious attempt at expenditure control,
since you get all the interest groups on board by not telling too many of them "no"
and let them hold out the promise of more profits and revenues.
Massachusetts is now facing the budget busting effects and trying to figure out 
how to pay for what they passed and how to save the money they need to save to keep it.
So, in comes Ben Nelson, as the 60th vote in the Senate asking for a payment
to his state of Nebraska to make "affordable" for his state the expansions that
would be needed.
I am not so cynical about this as many people are, this just set the stage for the
final bill to give more of the states more federal Medicaid aid, and he was saying,
you have to pay us to do this.
Even more important, how did this play in Massachusetts?  
This was the ONLY state in the nation where this could be and was the real political
calculus:  Massachusetts already has all the benefits contained in the federal bill,
so Massachusetts benefits only from the warm glow of passing their gains to the rest
of the nation... but no, they do gain something!  
They gain a share of the payments to all the other Medicaid and subsidy expansions
in the rest of the nation.
Massachusetts already had a generous Medicaid program that is subsidized by Nebraska
taxpayers.
Why should Massachusetts taxpayers be thrilled about seeing their taxes go up to
pay for more coverage in Nebraska?
You got it, and that's the way the vote went at the margin.
As most of you probably know, Scott Brown voted for the Massachusetts health care
reform, he's not really against the reform, he's against Massachusetts tax dollars
flowing to other states.))</i>

1) Note that Mike Barno has a new E-Mail address.

2) I'm not going to replace Fred if he does not return, orders here would not have mattered,
but if he doesn't respond, I will retreat his armies on the board rather than off the board.
Otherwise, they'll be in Civil Disorder unless Fred moves them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 10 (DARK PRESS -– NOT FOR ATTRIBUTION)):
A paragraph, a verb and a footnote Walk into a bar

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Stop, please."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Moving swiftly toward us was a chink in a dress... looked like he was going to the prom, 
cause it was all long and flowing.  I smoothed one hand into my jacket, and I wasn't 
scratching my armpit, if y'know what I mean.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didn't speak Chinknese, but I raised one eyebrow, which is pretty universally translated as 
"whatcha want?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He stopped in front of us and did a little dippy bow, "my Master wishes a Word with you."  
Something about the way he said it, and you knew that "word" was capitalized, 
and if you missed it you could always glance back a couple of lines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Your Master?  Who's your Master?" I asked.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Master Stylus.  He is very close."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I tink we should go wid 'em," smacked the blonde, "he's part of the Hand."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Hand... isn't that a tong?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"More of a fork," answered the blonde, "the world went one way, dey went t'other."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As always I was quick on the uptake, "I don't get it."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Back afore dere was computers and word processors," explained the blonde, 
"there were typin' writers."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I nodded impressed, "so this guy's packing a Remington?"  It was a big robe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Nah," continued the blonde, "afores there were even typin' writers people 
wrote their press and their moves with pen and pencil... by hand."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I looked askance at her, which is something that's not as easy as you'd think.  
You have to look sideways and incredulous... <i>at the same time</i>.  "Bullshit," I said, 
with the big smile on my face.  What'd they take me for, a rube?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The lady is wise beyond her beauty and her ill-concealed breasts," said the monk, 
"we are indeed ancient.  For before there was pen there was quill and ink and paper, 
and before there was quill and paper, there was clay tablets and... stylus.  
Master Stylus bids a few moments of your time."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I figured we might as well go with the guy, it wasn't like the Golden Age was going anywhere, 
and I didn't figure this was <i>all</i> filler and drivel.  
We followed him down the street and into a nondescript door.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The room inside was decorated in early minimalism, I believe the barren period.  
There was nothing on the walls, not even those cheesy Avalon Hill giveaway calendars 
with the pin up broads on them.  
You've seen 'em, the ones where the gal is holding up some wooden blocks strategically 
blocking her otherwise naked breasts.  They have a different model for each month, 
a French chick in the Spring, a Russian doxie in the Winter, you know.  
I've seen them because, my mechanic has one.  Yeah.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, the room was sparsely furnished like I was saying.  
There were some short benches, like what you kneel on at church, in front of some desks, 
also short.  The funny thing about the desks were they sprouted feathers.  
Weird d&#233;cor, little feathers sticking out of little pots.  
I always thought the chinks were a little off... even in the Hobby.  
I mean, they're not even a player except here in Variant-town.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rest of the décor consisted of a withered old man in long robes who rested much of his weight on a large stick.  I took this to be Master Stylus, behind him stood three young monks, practically identical to the one that had brought us here.  Our guide joined them to stand in a row behind his Master.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Welcome," said the geezer, in a reed thin voice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So, you must be Master Stylus," I am known for my deductive abilities, "what're you a Master of?"
	“
"The Way."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Way?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Way with Words.  I am a Master of the Written Word, a dual Master of both English and Literature."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So, you're unemployable in two fields."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You wit is only paralleled by your sagaciousness," he half bowed in reply. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What'd he say," I whispered to the blonde.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Ya don' wanna know," she whispered back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I am the Sensai of these teenage students, I teach them to master the Written Word; 
to move as the wind through the text without leaving a footnote, 
to read <i>between</i> the lines, to be as one with the words themselves."  
The four teenage ninja monks nodded silently behind him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, we called that home-schoolin', for the tards that couldn't cut the short bus.  
So the kid said you had something to tell us," I said.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yes," said the old man in his reed thin voice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well shoot," I said, "we ain't got all page."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"A paragraph, a verb and a footnote walk into a bar," wheezed the old man…

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"When I heard that one, it had a rabbi in it..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Shhhhh!," hissed the blonde.  The Master continued...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The paragraph tries to pick up a chick, she thought he was a little forward.  
The verb likes to think of himself as a man of action and gets into a fight with some bad words.  
The footnote just watches."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I used my most insightful tone, "what da hell?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It's a parable," said the Master.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"A pair of what?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Rocks fer brains," snapped the blonde, "it's a story dat makes a point."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Okay, I'll ante up.  What's the point?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The old man looked at a small strip of paper in his fingers, his lips moved a little, 
then he looked up at me, "Ill considered actions meet with consequences."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It was like the background music stopped... if we'd had background music.  
I always sort of liked it because it told ya when something significant was going to happen.  
The rising crescendo during the chase scene... you know what I mean.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I squinted at the old Monk (which made me think of a beer…this had been a dry segment) 
and shook my head, "that's not what it means!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
His face got all wrinkledly set into a stubborn pout, he stamped his 
big stick on the floor, "It's my parable!  I'll define it as I want to."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The four monks behind him chanted; "Define as I want to.  Define as I want to."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It could happen to you."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What could?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The consequences. As you continue in your efforts to find the Hierophant, you must precede with caution."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Cheeez," I exasperated... which is sort an emphatic exposition... with a little spit, 
"does everyone know my business...”

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What you seek is very important," wheezed the old man, 
"the Diplonomicon is a weapon of great power..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," I interrupted, 
"Great and Terrible power, twenty two rocks, major and minor Arkansas bullshit.  
I get it, I get it."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I am not sure you do," answered Master Stylus, "many forces are on the move 
in the Hobby, all seeking to gain this power for themselves.  
Many forces you have met, many you have yet to meet.  
You know of the Sisterhood of the Order Magister," the old man nodded toward the dame, 
"you know of Evil, you know of the Hierophant, you have even felt the attentions of the Caterpillar; 
others watch from darkness..."  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Was that a laugh I just heard?  What was he talking about a caterpillar?  The old man continued;
"Even our ancient rivals, the Tabula Rasa, the blank slate, are seeking the board and stones...
not to reunite them, but to erase them forever.  It would mean the end of all the Hobby."
"Sheesh," I said shaking my head, 
"ancient ninja orders and religious cults! 
Not to mention lions, tigers, elephants and caterpillars; 
then there's the mob, and now you want me to believe in a mythical undertext organization...
I'm not buying any of this!  
Next you'd have me believe the Secret Masters of Diplomacy were involved!"
The group of monks, nonplussed at the previous roll call of villains 
blanched at the last mention, and looked into the darkened corners of the room.  
Even the old monk covered his mouth with his hand.
"Oh, c'mon," I chortled, "they don’t even exist."

Somewhere, far away a phone rang.  The special phone, the red phone.  
A hand with long manicured nails reached out and picked up the handset.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Thay fellas, this shoah bettah be good.  I was takin' a siesta to get mah beauty sleep."

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note that Paul Rauterberg has a new E-Mail address.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that two seasons ago I mistakenly gave credit for Budapest to Italy, so thought
he had a build, but Germany is sitting there so he has it.
We can't go back to a build season that already has been adjudicated, but I can remove 
the Army that Italy built that he shouldn't have built, so I am going to do that.
The new positions and the corrected Supply Center Chart reflect where we are for 
Spring, which will be due February 13th.
Orders that I have on file, will remain on file.

Total Replenishments: 12+12+12+60+20+22+21+19+16+38 = 232

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FAMOUS FOUR): Little family reunion.
<i>((Still a bit lagging with your riding, we'll see if the reunion
spices up your performance a bit.
You hit the third highest replenishment total.
But replenishment total so far is not translating into points.
Tom Howell's Never Ending Worry Source tops the replenishment totals but is
in the lower half of total points.
Tom also reminds us that this is supposed to be a press game, so let's get
some press!!!))</i>

(TOM SAYS): Did you say this is a press game?  Don't see any.   &lt; g &gt;

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm off next weekend to run the Diplomacy tournament at TempleCon.
Check out our last issue (#108) of Diplomacy World (http://www.diplomacyworld.net)
which focuses on FTF Dip and see more of what I said there.
Can't we get some of you out to join us at a FTF event somewhere 
sometime soon?
I'd like to get you to TempleCon since I'd like to keep growing TempleCon,
but go SOMEWHERE and play Diplomacy!
