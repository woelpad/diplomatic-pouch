<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
On that list, I notified everyone of the last issue's delay.
We had an issue with the web page, Edi Birsan and Bill Blackmer are helping to engineer
a long awaited purging and rebirth of the Diplomatic Pouch website.
I couldn't do updates, but I think we're OK updating things now.
So everything should be back where you expect to see it.
We have issues of <i>Tinamou</i> and <i>By the Way</i> in this issue if everything
is going as planned.
We're making progress on starting new games, help fill things up, see below for more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal port/DipPouch/Postal

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now clearly back and appears in most issues!
Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack,
but Rip also has been missing in action lately, I don't have an update but he
and Dave Partridge communicate. 
Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JEFF KEY</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been planning to put Jeff Key up here many times in the past, but
someone else always made it to the list.
Since we have the aborted John Beshara search, this is the time to find Jeff.
I met Jeff that I remember just once, I think it was at Paul Gardner's house
and one of those wild spread out cons that he used to have at his house in
Vermont.  But I've not heard from Jeff now in many, many years.
So let's go find him!
As always it is worth fifty bucks if you locate him and get him to write to me.
Jeff, of course, is most famous for devising and naming the Key Lepanto 
game opening alliance between Austria and Italy against Turkey.
For some reason, I've been seeing LOTS of Key Lepantos or aborted 
Key Lepantos lately.  It's about time that we find Jeff and see what he's
been up to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
But most of the talk that there has been has about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson

Congrats on reaching 300, and I do really appreciate your running  
Peery's wonderful piece on Beshara. I enjoyed it not only because he  
brought Beshara "alive" before our very eyes, but because it shows  
that Peery's writing hasn't missed a step.  I also enjoyed the color  
fotos, especially the one of Smythe, who I corresponded with so many  
times but never met.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the other hand, I certainly did meet Eric Ozog sometime in the mid

Jonathan and Jim:
I saw your exchange regarding old 'zines.  My two cents worth follows.  If there
are better ideas, no hurt feelings here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I recently told Tim Haffey that if we could figure out how to get Larry Peery's
Dip Archives from Tim's place (in the Bay area of CA) to mine (near Port
Angeles, WA), say later this year, before it gets wet, I could store them in my
new garage until I have time to go through them.  If they did end up here,
eventually I would go through them cataloging and indexing.  My ultimate goal
would be to compare what I then had to Bowling Green's Popular Culture Library's
Dip holdings and send them what they don't already have.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Eventually", means, after I finish the garage and a house which currently
exists only an paper and as concrete footings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If this makes any sense to you and you don't get a better offer, we should talk
further.  As for transportation, do you ever come over to the wet side?  If you
were to visit the Seattle or Tacoma area later this summer or early in the fall,
I could meet you some where for a transfer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<i>((Jonathan and Tom are making progress off line, but this exchange
between me and Tom also is relevant to all of you....
Yes, Tom, I did think of you first, as Jonathan is somewhat physically
near you, at least close enough that perhaps the two of you would be
able to work out some mutually agreeable meeting place to save the
effort and expense of "mailing" banana boxes.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Tom Howell (Thu, 29 Jun 2006 22:22:55 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,
The effort will be transferring them from storage location to car to car to new
storage location.  The expense will be in the additional gas to cart them to or
from the transfer point.  I'm willing to pay my half!  However, if someone else
wants them more than I do, they'd be welcome to them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'll bet this will work.  You two don't have to include me in further
discussions if you don't want to.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think I will, just FYI.  You do seem to be a good clearing house for this kind
of information.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, well, I'm in touch with a whole lot of projects in a whole lot of
corners of the Diplomacy hobby, too many actually, I don't have time to actually
do anything, although I am playing in quite a few games in various places at the
moment...  Also, just FYI, Edi Birsan and Bill Blackmer
are working out a deal about what to do with Tim's
archives.  Edi and Bill have this dream of scanning
them all into PDFs.  I think they dramatically
underestimate the effort, but wish them luck....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I did offer to take Tim's (Larry's) collection, but if they want to do the
scanning and corrections, more power to them.  Sounds very time consuming. 
Personally, I'm not a fan of pdf files, as they bloat up much larger than the
information content.  But then, if I wasn't still on dial-up, I probably
wouldn't mind downloading them quite so much...  ;)

I'm no expert, but you can save lots and lots of space by opening Adobe 
Acrobat first and then scanning FROM that software as opposed to using 
your scanner's software and then converting to Adobe.
In extreme cases, I've seen a factor difference of more than 100 (that's
100 times, not 100 per cent!) in the size of the resulting file.
A simple page with text can be as small as 15-20 KB (and that's tiny)
when scanned in directly from Adobe, but easily can be over 1000 KB 
scanned any other way.))</i>

I have some discussion of this in the overdue issue of o-t-s.  Don't know when
it'll be out - I'm in summer work mode.  I suppose I should take a weekend off
and just do it, but I took last weekend off and went to Deadwood con at Eric
Ozog's.  Terry, Daf, and John Biehl showed up, as well as Barb and I.  Joan
Extrom was going to come, but cancelled at the last minute.  We played a lot of
Carcassonne and a game of Lord of the Rings RISK!  Eric won all the Carcassonne
and the Good side won the Risk game.

I nearly died the night UCLA lost the NCAA basketball final to Florida.  I've 
rooted for the Bruins for over thirty years now; they're my favorite team in 
all of sports.
<i>((You know, I'm a huge UCLA fan too, but I'm also a huge Billy Donovan
fan, and I had my prediction to protect where I actually did NAIL who was
going to win.
Of course, I also grew up as and still am a huge John Wooden worshipper.
You will then also remember (being in the Capital District area) when there
used to be late night Saturday night UCLA Bruins games telecast on.... I think
it was Channel 10 in Albany in the 1970's when I was in high school.
David was too young.... right Dave?... but I used to sit up late at night watching
those games, those were the Bill Walton years.
I had a tough time rooting for the Bruins with Jim Harrick, watching the whole 
Harrick thing (up close here for awhile at University of Rhode Island! and then
off to Georgia with the famous Jim Harrick, Jr. "basketball final exam" that
included the famous question, "how many points is a three point shot worth?"
for college credit).
But things are looking much better now as Ben Howland is a great coach and I'm 
reigniting my Bruins passion.
It's always good to hear from John Wooden, possibly the kindest great man in
all of sports.))</i>

Was Jeff Key really at one of Paul Gardner's cons?  I have no recollection of 
ever having met him!
<i>((Yes!!!
He didn't stay for the whole time as I recall, but I distinctly remember meeting

I could be confusing my cons, that's always possible.....))</i>

You are correct to say that my house cons aren't really Diplomacy cons - we 
play lots of different games (there are 1200 in our collection, and it's 
growing), but I can only recall one Diplomacy game here in the past eight years.  
Typically our house cons draw anywhere from 30 to 50 people - we set a record 
last summer with 63!  (Good thing we have a house big enough to hold 'em all!) 
For the most part, we play the new German-style games (Settlers of Catan, 
Princes of Florence, et al) which didn't even exist back in postal Diplomacy's 
heyday.  I keep a list of what's played and the winner of each game; at our 
last con, we played 140 different games.  Several old-time Diplomacy folks still 
attend all or some of our cons, including Mike Barno, Dave Lincoln, Paul 
Gardner, Eric Brosius, Joan Extrom, Nelson Heintzman, and, of course, your brother 
Dave (he counts, right?).  Alan Moon also shows up occasionally, when he's not 
too busy.  Alan, of course, is widely known now as the best game designer in 
the U.S., with his latest success being Ticket to Ride and its offshoots.

Lab Con (our annual Fourth of July house con) starts in two days, and we're 
expecting about 50 people this time.  We're psyched!  I'll stop now, but I 
could talk all night about games and game cons...Diplomacy was just my start!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The ninth annual Lab Con was an enjoyable event as usual. Here are the 54 
people who attended <i>((excerpted list of TAP/Dip related persons, just so
you know "who's out there" if you want to connect up with old pals))</i>:
Donna Balkan, Mike Barno, Claire Brosius, Eric Brosius, Jo Brosius, Sam Brosius,
Adam Burgess, Dave Burgess, Evan Burgess, Paul Gardner, Dave Lincoln, John Lincoln,
Sue Lincoln, Bruce Linsey, Gary Linsey, Janet Linsey, Kevin Linsey, Krissi Linsey,
Sandy Linsey, Shannon Linsey, Sugar Linsey, Jim McCarthy....
A very nice mix of people, I felt. As a group, we played 252 games overall, 
including 126 different games. Here are the games we played this time around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Get the list from Bruce if you want to see it.... no Diplomacy again,
;-) but lots of Carcassonne....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although other less substantial games were played more, I felt that the hits 
of this con were Thurn und Taxis, Tonga Bonga, and Indonesia. This is the 
third straight Lab Con at which Puerto Rico hasn't been played!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My personal stats: I played 50 games overall (all different), winning 11 1/6 
times (the 1/6 of a win was in Shadows Over Camelot), and learned 23 games 
which were new to me.  As usual, by playing so many new games, I discovered 
several good ones.  To me, the best finds this time turned out to be:  Tahiti, 
Shadows Over Camelot, Square Mile, Dawn Under, Tombouctou, Spree!, Cabale, and 
Bridges of Shangri-La.  Some oldies-but-goodies that I had fun with included:  
St. Petersburg, El Grande, Tonga Bonga, Medici, Zendo, Royal Turf, Settlers 
Historical: Great Wall, Turfmaster, and several others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm now within one good con of reducing my Games-Owned-But-Not-Yet-Played 
list down to below 200, which is where I'll want it to stay. Once I do, I will 
become much less interested in playing new games all the time, and able to 
concentrate more on enjoying old favorites.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following changes have taken place to the Board of Champions:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anne Norton added Thurn und Taxis (new), and St. Petersburg (taken from Eric 
Brosius). Eric Brosius added Outpost (new) and Tonga Bonga (new). Tom DeMarco 
added Caylus (new). Tim DeMarco added Magic: The Gathering (new). Andy Latto 
added Diamant (taken from Mike Barno). Dave Lincoln added Niagara (new). Larry 
Chong added Spinball (new). John Lincoln added Pit (new). This means that Eric 
is still the overall champ with 12 games to Anne's 11. Tom DeMarco and Dave 
Lincoln have five games each, while no one else has more than two.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for future cons: We think (but are not yet sure) that we will have another 
themed con of some sort over New Year's weekend, just before we take off for 
Hawaii. We are fairly sure we will have KinderKon over Presidents Day weekend 
in mid-February. Lab Con next year will likely fall on the weekend before July 
4 (the Fourth is on a Wednesday) and perhaps go through the holiday.

Dear Jim,
I'm a member of the BT and Post office Board games Club, I enclose a copy of our Zines. 
I was wondering if you'd please be able to put an ad in your own zine or website for our 
club which is now so small that it's almost moribund. Even if people don't want to play 
in our games (Diplomacy and Railway Rivals) which are never more than one game of each 
at a time, at least they can subscribe to the zine by e-mail. Oh yes, we also run an 
occasional game called Brawl, it's a cowboy game set in a saloon and the last player 
standing is the winner.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You might be interested to know that the BGC is the second oldest in Europe and has 
been going for well over 30 years. If you can help in any way i'd be most grateful.

cool.  It probably is similar to Snowball Fighting which is what we

wing rival (The Tory Bleeder) are available from peter.r.williams of bt.com.       
You don't need to play any games to join the BGC club. However, we do offer 
occasional Railway Rivals games as well as Diplomacy (by e-mail only) and a 
vicious cowboy fight game set in a wild west saloon, where the last man 
standing in the saloon wins the game. This game is very quick, it takes 
30 seconds to write your orders and you can shoot, kick, punch your hated 
rivals or even thrust a broken bottle into his face –- it’s fantastic 
but only if if you’re a sadist, just plain slick or a games fanatic!

Jim,
The cowboy game is very simple and orders which are very basic and  
quick can be given over the phone (WE ARE THE BT Board Games Club) 
or via e-mail the normal way, or I guess by post. All other games  
are normally run by e-mail but phone is acceptable. Thanks for running  
the ad. My suggestion is that you e-mail peter.r.williams of bt.com and  
ask to receive the club magazine and to go onto the waiting list for Brawl.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Did I send you copies of the latest club magazines? I'll recheck my  
sent box and if I didn't, I'll send you a copy of each magazine. 
Peter who edits the Bleeder (I edit the Tory Bleeder) is always after  
press, so a brief low down on your club with contact details just in  
case any of our members wish to join your club would be greatly  
appreciated and we can also advertise your club for you.

Thanks for the back issues.  I especially enjoyed reading about your 
DIDs, etc.  Glad to see that you still appreciate Joy Division.  I think 
I essentially finished my quest to own every song (but not every single 
re-mix) ever legally released by JD, New Order, Electronic, Monaco, 
Revenge, and The Other Two.  I also saw New Order in New York last year. 
Other than that, I don't pay as much attention to new music as I used 
to and just get disgusted that I can't get my teenage son to listen to 
much more than classic rock - although I have been able to get him to 
enjoy the Pistols and The Clash.

I would never say that I like NO better than JD.  I think they are both 
great.  NO does have a small number of bad songs and JD has none, but NO has 
a much larger body of work.  However, JD was a tad before my time, so I grew 
up waiting for the next NO album to be released, seeing them in concert, etc 
while I never had that opportunity for JD.

The Cardinals have lost 8 games in a row.  And they are still on top of their
division!  The White Sox have the second best record in baseball, and are
second in their division.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sadly, the biggest story at the World Cup has been the refs.  Way too many
bad calls, and especially game changing ones.  Play has been less than
spectacular.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots of intriguing possiblities in football.  One can't really claim there's
parity, the discrepancy during the season between the good teams and the bad
ones is actually quite large, but it does really seem that picking which
teams will be in which category each year is getting harder.  Pats, barring
injuries, are looking pretty good.

The Red Sox have won 10 in a row and have not caught the White Sox! 
And while I keep expected the Tigers to eventually falter, right now
it looks like the wildcard will come frome the Central Division. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think that given how many games that the Eastern teams have to
play against each other, it is nearly assured that the Wild Card will 
come from the Central Division.  I also note how
well Mauer and the Twins are playing.... but they still can't make
up any ground.  At the present time, the Yankees and the Blue Jays
are in big trouble and need to find a lot of wins before the All
Star Break or even the Twins will pass them.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the World Cup, there are some very tasty possibilities coming up, especially
Germany/Argentina and Brazil/France.  Will this be Zidane's last
game?  Or possibly Ronaldo's?  (But I expect it will be Zidane's.)  
And yes, the refereeing has been atrocious. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Isn't it interesting that when you have atrocious refereeing,
that the "favored" teams tend to win.... specifically the Europeans?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, it's almost as bad as the NBA!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think that you have it exactly right that Germany/Argentina
and Brazil/France will be tasty, but they will cause extreme
heartburn unless you're a European fan.  I'll be shocked if 
France and Germany don't win.  And I'll also be shocked if there
isn't lots of crying afterward about atrocious refereeing.  You
heard it here first..... yes, another Jim-Bob prediction.
I actually think that England or Germany will win it all,
but that's not based on much serious analysis.  The first
is a true prediction.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pats have a nice soft schedule and should win at least 12 games and a
1st-round bye.  And that makes a huge difference come playoff time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just got my TAP this morning.  Gotta get my World Cup picks in before
the games start.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have read the coverage of the draft, mostly by reading Bill
Simmons.  Should the C's simply have held onto Randy Foye?  I know
they needed a PG badly, but did they really want to get two?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Danny is saying that he wants to "play two" point guards while counting
Delonte West as a point guard now too - though he (like Iverson) was
originally a two.  The debate here is whether Danny is just blowing 
smoke and that Telfair or West is going to Philly in the trade for Iverson
and the other plays alongside Iverson as a standard Point OR whether 
he's serious that he wants all his guards to be point/two's.  Those
views may not be mutually exclusive since Iverson's been playing the 
point.  But Iverson definitely is being traded from all the buzz and the
C's are in the running.  Ainge didn't like Foye or any of the other two
guards.  We've not heard precisely why he and everyone else seemed
to discount UConn players in the draft.  Perhaps you have a view on
that as a huge UConn fan?  There also are a lot of "undrafted" guys
who are garnering lots of interest, especially Pittsnogle.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rudy Gay is universally acclaimed as having tremendous talent and
potential.  And he was damnably invisible half the time for UConn.  He
was the best player on a team that was upset by George Mason because
they never really played like a team.  He seems to have a bad
attitude and looks likely to be yet another talented swingman that
doesn't work hard.  Dime a dozen in the NBA.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Marcus Williams didn't have Gay's motivational issues.  OTOH, he has
a criminal record, having been arrested for theft last year.  Red
flags galore.  As I understand it, Ainge prefers Telfair over any of
the rookie point guards anyway.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been waiting for all these early draft picks to bear fruit, but
it still looks like Paul Pierce has little real help.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have found it very hard to watch the NBA in the post-Jordan era. 
And from what I've read, the latest Finals would not change my
opinion much.  It sounds like David Stern made sure he didn't have to
give the trophy to Mark Cuban.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
*tweet*
And it's another two free throws for Dwayne Wade.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I actually found the games kinda watchable.  I didn't watch all of them,
but they were better games than has passed for playoff play in the NBA
in recent years.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I would be stunned if England won it all.  They have a good team, but
not a championship team. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Predictions for the quarters, in decreasing order of confidence:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Brazil over France:
Yes, France looked good against Spain, and they do appear to be
playing better.  Also, it will not be easy to knock Zidane out of his
last World Cup.  But Brazil has a lot of players as good as Zidane. 
Brazil should win.  Their one weakness has been a tendency to play at
the level of their opponents, but I don't think they'll take France
lightly.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Spanish team, while they dominated the game, was ripe for
plucking.  It seemed their only plan for defense was to get Thierry
Henry whistled for offside repeatedly.  (And he obliged!)  After
France tied the game right before halftime, Spain seemed to collapse
psychologically.  I expect Brazil to win.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Italy over Ukraine:
Ukraine is lucky to still be around.  They are here because they
landed in a pathetically easy group and because the Swiss didn't
really try to score at all in the 2nd round game.  I think the
vaunted Italian defense should be able to shut down Shevchenko and
company.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
England over Portugal:
The papers are worried because Portugal's coach Scolari is 2-0
against England in recent years.  Of course, one of those two games
was when he was coaching Brazil in 2002.  I would discard that.  The
other game came to penalty picks, so I would say it's a wash. 
England is playing moderately well, though nobody thinks they're
really in top form.  Portugal will be missing three of their best
players to red cards and injury from the game against Holland. 
That's going to be a bit too much to overcome.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Germany over Argentina:
This is very, very hard to pick.  If the game were being played
anywhere but in Germany, I would pick Argentina.  And if Argentina
hadn't played such an uninspiring game against Mexico, I would pick
Argentina.  Sadly, Argentina has not made any deep runs in the
tournament since Maradona's days, and I fear that this rule will
hold, esp. given the German talent for winning games in a manner that
baffles prognosticators.  They never really seem that good or
talented.  They just win.  I don't even know how they'll win.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In any case, I take the winner of this game as the favorite for the
Cup, with Brazil as runner-up.

Henry is offside again.

This World Cup has been particularly good for nice goals.  The goal
Goz mentions, the 15-pass goal for Argentina against Serbia, the
Beckham free kick against Ecuador, Joe Cole's volley, Zidane's goal
against Spain, many of Brazil's goals....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I really think the biggest difference between the top teams and many
of the competitive also rans is the ability to convert a goal-scoring
opportunity into an actual goal.  A lot of the lesser teams like the
US, Australia, Ghana, South Korea, etc., are good enough in the
middle 80 yards of play, but just do not score enough.  (This is
particularly true of the US team.)  Time after time I see a player
with an open shot panic and shoot wildly.  That was one very
impressive thing about Zidane's goal.  He knew he was past the
defense and only had to beat one defender and the goalkeeper.  He
patiently moved forward and beat the defender with a ball trick.  And
then he got the goalie wrongfooted and simply tapped the ball in. 
Ronaldo also has this ability to shoot quickly and accurately.  This
is my one concern about Argentina, who seemed to be pressing against
Mexico.  If they play with less than full confidence, Germany will
smack them.  If they can get all their players going at full speed,
they are more talented than Germany, and should win.  My pick is
basically a coin toss.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pick wise I agree with Rick's rundown. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
France did play well against Spain, although Spain looked uninspired,
but I don't see the play they've been doing generating enough goals
against Brazil.  Brazil is playing (as always) where one just has
to expect several break away opportunites each half, and their forwards
can be counted on to maintain their calm and turn those chances into
goals.  I'm expecting at least two Brazilian goals and I don't see
France getting three.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think this is the game that will have people screaming the most
afterward about refereeing.  If you think the discussions about the
referees have been vehement thus far, you ain't seen nuttin yet.
My prediction, hinted at previously but stated specifically now,
is that France will win 2-1 or 1-0, probably in overtime, and
on controversy from the referees - big time.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Italy will most likely beat Ukraine, but I'm thoroughly unimpressed
with Italian play.  The game with the US was a refereeing fiasco,
but still they should have won it if they are to be considered real
contenders.  Against the Aussies they were down a man for a lot true,
but again their play didn't inspire me.  I still expect them to win
this round, but certainly not the next.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree with this completely, Italy wins this round and then loses.
And France/Italy will be THE most boring game of the entire World
Cup.  They will surely be nil-nil in regular time, and it probably
comes down to a shootout.  But France has ZERO chance in the final.
AFTER THE END UPDATE: I got all confused about who was going to play
whom in the Semis, I would still stick with this pick of France/Italy
being the most boring game, although today some could argue that.
And I did say that France had "Zero chance in the Final", so that's
a good pick..... nah, I admit it, I didn't think Italy had a shot.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm going with Germany over Argentina.  Again, the Argentinian performance
against Mexico did not look like what I was expecting from them.  Yes,
the goal against Mexico was a thing of beauty, but that's not going to
be enough against Germany.  If they play Germany like they played Mexico,
they will lose.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Germany will win pretty easily.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
England I think will prevail over Portugal, but again I think that's
as far as they are going.  So it's Brazil against Germany in the finals,
which will be tight, but I give the disciplined German team the home
field advantage over the individual heroes of Brazil.

Game over, Germany wins 4-2 in penalty kicks.  I gave in and went
home for lunch (the advantage of living 3 miles from work and being
a one man office ( &lt; : ).  A good game, tied 1-1 in regulation, no
scoring in the overtimes.  Argentina scored first with a very nice
header and Germany responded with their own great header goal.  The
refs were a bit free with the yellow cards in my opinion, but they
didn't make any game changing calls.  Argentina played much better
than against Mexico I think.  Pity they had to meet this early.

England outplayed Portugal for most of the game.  They just didn't
score.  And then Rooney got frustrated and drew the red card.  Their
penalty kicking was atroicious.  You would think they'd learn how to
do that at some point.

I think France will handle Portugal easily.  Zidane is back into the
form of five years ago, and I think he can keep it up for two more
games.  I still think I'll accept the idea that Germany will lose at
home only when I see it.  I think it'll be Germany over France in the

Jim had it right with France, they deserved to win that game.  I didn't
get to see the finish of the German/Italian game, but through the 
first overtime I have to say that I thought Italy was playing better.
Much as they've done in the past they seem to play much better in the
later rounds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Portugal/England was unimpressive all around, with the exception of the
Portuguese goalie during the penalty shoot out.  He guessed every single
shot right, even getting a hand on the one that got in.  Either the
English really telgraphed their shots or he's very very good at penalty
kick blocking.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm sure I'm just setting myself up for another failure, but I'll pick
France over Portugal based on the play that I've seen from them so far.

I got into the ESPN pool on this one.  Was doing real well until the 
Quarters (as in "top 3% of 100K"...now I'll be lucky to make the top half). 
Got Italy right in the first Quarter match and have missed everything since. 
So I'll take Germany in the 3rd place match and Italy as overall champ, 
ensuring that they'll both bite it.

Germany over Portugal is a gimme.  Portugal probably won't care, and
they won't get any of their patented diving calls aganist the home
team.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm hard-pressed to make my mind up about the final.  I've already
seen my favorites Argentina and Germany fall by the wayside, and I'm
reluctant to make another prediction.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Italy has the stronger defense, but they don't really have any
offensive weapons quite as good as the combination of Zidane, Henry,
and Ribery.  Zidane in particular is playing better than anybody
else, and that's always a good reason to go with a team.  OTOH,
Barthez was miserable last night, and lucky to avoid any goals.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If I were a betting man, I would go with the "under" here, and
possibly go with a prop bet that Zidane scored, combined with an
insurance bet that Italy got a shutout.  I won't pick a winner, but I
think there's potential for a great final.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Watch out for the punk de Rossi.  He'll be back from his 4-game
suspension for elbowing Brian McBride.  He had a firm grip on Most
Loathsome for the tournament until last night, when Ronaldo's running
dive put him firmly in the lead.  I wonder if he realizes just how

<i>((Yeah, I didn't see Italy winning at all.  
I had a question.  I can see why you have shootouts in some games.
But in THE final game, shouldn't you just play on until someone 
scores???  I know the answer always is that this is not a fair
test of stamina, that's what the extra 30 minutes are about.
OK, let's say we accept that (fair, I think), then, if you are going to
have "kicks", I think doing it as trading corner kicks is more of
a "team effort" than penalty kicks.  Why not have five ten second
timed corner kicks for each side instead?  It might be a BIT tricky
timing these, you could also have the corner kick go until the defending
team knocks the ball back away from the goal, but this might also
be hard to judge.  Still, it would seem much preferable to the 
shootout.  Arguably, the corner kick is the most exciting play in
soccer.))</i>

While there may be a better way to decide ties, I still think that the game 
has a fundamental flaw.  A statistic I saw today said that in the 64 games 
played in this years' WC, there were only 120 non-penalty-kick goals. 
Something has to be done to open up the flow of the game.  I don't know if 
it's fewer players, more subs, more penalties for flopping, shorter fields, 
or something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Joke making the rounds:  Why do so many people play soccer?  So they don't 
have to watch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hockey opened up their game, and it was better than it had been for a long 
time.  Even though Stanley Cup scoring wasn't up the game was continuously 
end-to-end, and looked like there were a lot more scoring chances than there 
had been.  It was a lot better watching than, say, the years that the Devils 
won with their clutch-and-grab in the neutral zone style, and it gave both 
the better attackers and better goaltenders a chance to excell.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Soccer needs to do something along those lines.  It's just too hard to mount 
an attack.
FWIW.

Much as I hate to say it, the answer is more yellow cards.  But hand
them out for the dives.  Way too much diving going on.  Anybody who
has to be pulled off the field on a stretcher shouldn't be up and
running again a minute later.  I applauded the English when they got
so fed up with the Portuguese diving that they ignored the man "down" 
and kept on playing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other than that I'm not really sure what you'd do to increase scoring.
Perhaps make the goals a bit wider?  That would encourage more shooting
from long distances.

I don't know if the game needs to be opened up for more scoring.  But
they really need to do something about the diving and bad
sportsmanship.  Diving is already a cardable offense - it's just hard
to enforce.  The solution is to have more enforcement via postgame
scrutiny.  Many of the dives that are not apparent to the referee are
quite apparent to the TV camera.
<i>((There is a little of this in basketball, but I don't know any
other sport that is so enamored of flopping around and pretending you've
been hit or hurt.
Ideally, you would get it out by appealing to manliness or something,
so that people who dove were immediately persona non grata in the
sport.))</i>  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I hate the penalty shootout but it does resolve the game quickly. 
Ideally teams would continue to play until somebody scored, but that
becomes increasingly unfeasible as all the players become more and
more tired.  The corner kick idea is interesting but it won't happen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My post-tournament rankings, based on play in this tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Italy - the most consistent, and the only team to beat either
Germany or France.  Best defense by far and one of the best
goalkeepers.  Could probably use a bit more scoring, though they
didn't need it in this tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Germany - by a smidgen over the #3 team.  They were more
consistent than France and actually beat Argentina, who were probably
the best team.  Germany had the most productive offense and a great
goalie, but were a bit weak on defense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Argentina - if the tournament were to start again tomorrow,
Argentina would be the favorite.  They need to play Messi more.  In
theory, they should have gotten at least two goals against Germany,
even with Germany playing at home.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) France - a bit inconsistent.  When Zidane is on and Henry is
playing well, they are as good as anyone.  Defense is very good, but
Barthez was not a top goalkeeper.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) Brazil - considering the talent, this team was a huge
disappointment.  Their coach never demanded fitness from their team
and never instituted a game plan to win games.  Scolari would have
won the Cup with the talent here.  How did Ronaldinho, FIFA's player
of the year, disappear AGAIN in a World Cup?  He's running out of
excuses.  Even fat Ronaldo was more impressive.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) Portugal - a hard pick for #5, as I almost put Portugal ahead of
Brazil.  Portugal has a solid defense and good scorers, but Crispino
Ronaldo really needs to grow up.  His habit of diving indicates a
lack of confidence in his team's ability to win a fair game.  Ricardo
is a great goalkeeper.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7,8,9) England, Spain, and Holland.  All talented teams, all
perenially underachieving in major tournaments.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other notables:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ukraine: they got to the quarters mostly because they had a lucky
draw.  Shevchenko is a great player, and ultimately losing to Italy
doesn't look so bad in retrospect.  But Italy was a LOT better.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ghana and Ivory Coast: very exciting teams that are still a bit too
sloppy to beat the best teams.  Sad for Ghana that they didn't have
Michael Essien to play Brazil.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
South Korea and Japan: both teams fell off a lot from their
performance levels from their home matches in 2002.  I expect them to
be back.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
US and Mexico:  US was a major disappointment.  I think Arena has run
out his string, and that the team needs a new high-profile coach like
Klinsman to bring them to the next level.  A lot of players were no
better in 2006 than they were in 2002.  With Freddy Adu making his
way through the pipeline, the US needs to work harder.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mexico was very impressive in their game against Argentina.  They
seem to play poorly against European teams, though, compared to how
they play the South American teams.  Both Mexico and the US need to
play more outside of CONCACAF.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Switzerland: great defense, but they really need to score a bit more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Czechs: sad that they had to essentially play without their top two
strikers.  A great goalie in Cech and we saw in the first game the
level they are capable of playing at.  But they apparently took Ghana
lightly and it was too late for them when they needed to beat a tough
Italy squad to advance.  They will be back.

Like Dave, I think of myself primarily as a liberal Republican politically,
in the flavor that you see today primarily in New England, but despite
the debunking you're going to see below, I am convinced that (and this
is a common enough suggestion that you can count on at least one more

Democratic challenger.  In 2000, I voted for Chafee thinking I was voting
for a swing Republican voter.
While Chafee really has influenced amazingly little in the last six years
(one problem), the bigger problem is that the liberal Republican block as
a whole just doesn't seem to be able to do much.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Anyway, what all this research is showing that I find interesting is that
the variation that we call "polarized Red State/Blue State" really is a 
continuum of Purples.
Gerrymandering of districts has made each individual Congressional district
more Red or Blue, to be sure, but that really doesn't translate all that well
to the state level, despite the Presidential election maps that people draw.
Moreover, it also explains why the midterm election is going to hinge on debates
about stem cell research and gay marriage.
There is a bit of "polarization" in the country on moral issues, though not
nearly as much as rhetoric might lead you to believe, but surprisingly little
variation of thought on economic issues, and NO evidence at all of polarization
on economics.
Nearly all Americans are middle of the road, generally believing in the benefits
of free market economics and free trade, but with concerns about the power
of corporate America and even larger multinationals.
In the areas where economics suggests free markets don't work that well, like
health care, they see more need for government involvement.
But this lack of polarization makes it difficult to define parties and raise
money around economic issues.
Raise money and fight about that which is polarized, that is the secret to raising
enough money.
And on economics, both parties are oriented toward big business almost equally.
BUT, even there, the moral polarization that does exist if anything has been
slightly shrinking, YET most people still vote on the economic issues, regardless
of the rhetoric!!!  And where that breaks down (voting on Economics) is in the rural
areas that are very conservative morally.  They vote on morals, against their 
economic interest, and it can be proven that they suffer still further economically
for it.  That hasn't been explained all that well.  
And there still is a whole lot of cultural diversity between Cambridge, MA and Fargo,
ND, but it isn't a red state/blue state divide, but a cultural continuum that 
zigzags around between states and communities in a far from linear fashion.
Like David, I do think all this is quite fascinating.
If the way politics works is to be changed, we could remove the gerrymandering
of Congressional districts (though I'm not sure how) or we could change the money,
lobbying, revolving door between gov't and corporate America, both are nearly 
impossible to see happening, but they have to if the political game is to change.))</i>

see Rip's subszine elsewhere in most issues of <i>TAP</i>.
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com and try to entice him to return.
Rip has been a bit missing in action lately, but I am assured that he

I'm ready to start a new Breaking Away game, who's interested???
Challenge David Partridge again as he is in, so are 
Brendan Whyte and Alexander Woo.
I also am giving a free spot to Eric Martin.
Anyone else?
Rick Desper is in too.
That leaves us looking for ONE more spot, can I convince someone to take that now???
Please, please, I'd like to get toward starting that next issue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game of REGULAR Diplomacy if there is enough interest!!!
I have seven I'm putting in this game, and I think there was even more interest
for another game (starting with Sean O'Donnell - Sean and Jeff both wanted into
this game, but I decided to put Jeff in since Jeff gave me a preference list first.
If you WANT me to use the preference lists I have, please send them in.  I only
have preference lists from three of you, and I still need some game fees.
We have Marc Ellinger (pd), Drew James (pd),Don Williams, John Crow, 
Fred Wiedemeyer, David Burgess, and Jeff O'Donnell. For truth in advertising, David is my brother, but I will be scrupulously fair
in GMing things and if in doubt, will call on an ombudsman... or just rule 
against Dave.... that's fair, right???  ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.
We have Karl Schmit and Sean O'Donnell on the list, let's get seven!!
It's FREE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly or you can look at them at
www.variantbank.org.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'll try to remember to punch in the rules in the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough and Bruce Edwards are interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, Steve Koehler, Art Schleinkofer,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, and Dave Partridge are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, we only need TWO more!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(7 OF 9'S LOG): Captain Pike has been relieved of duty, I am in temporary command.
First Captain Pike marooned a troop transport on Deep Space One with no way to 
transport the men back to Vulcan.
Then he used the Enterprise to help abandon Deep Space Two in anticipation of
an obvious Cardassian attack.
The thing is, the Enterprise could have held Deep Space Two had Pike chosen
to fight.
With the loss of DS 2, we will have to decommission DS 1's troop transport,
leaving it defenseless.
On top of that, the Ferengi, led by another holdover from my universe is about
to attack to get revenge for the Federation takeover of Ferengar in that 
universe.
This Federation is about to fall, partially because of my predecessor's one
fatal mistake.... 7 out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERNE[D]), DEC 31, 1903): The Center for Strategic Studies 
observes that Austria-Hungary has taken Rumania from the Russians, 
Bulgaria from the Turks and, now, Greece from the Italians. All three 
have lost traditional protectorates to the Austrian hegemonist. If 
they do not unite to extirpate the aggressor they each, in turn, shall 
fall.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to PAUL): Nice stab!
Not that I didn't see it coming.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Cardassian scum!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY to TURKEY): ... Help! ...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to BUDDY): I should have listened, at least I would have gone down fighting.
The best part is you will probably outlast me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I'm glad you're not dead!...
You might wish you were the first time you see Jason Johnson pitch!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to JEFF): Ohhhhhhh, the Red Sox sent Jason down, but they're actually
talking about bringing him back to start in Wakefield's spot over the upcoming
weekend.
Talk about heartburn!
I think I will wish I was dead if he starts another game..... the Yankees are
right on our heels!
At least the Rookie pitchers are all holding their own or better.
Update, we got ANOTHER rookie pitcher up instead, a guy named Gabbard
who manager Tito Francona keeps meeting and forgetting, but at least Jason Johnson
stays down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE to BERLIN AND PARIS): We are not pleased with the outcome 
of this battle. Since we were unable to conquer France. We do not mind in 
the slightest that England conquers them. Besides, the leader of France we 
all know sucks. I mean come on this is obviously a petty dictator that needs 
overthrown. I apologize to the French people for being unable to do so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG "UNREAL"): Against the advice of my senior staff, except Mr. Spock,
I decided not to defend Earth and Mars, attack the Romulans at Vulcan, and 
abandon Deep Space One to the Romulan Neutral Zone to try to cut a 
Romulan Supply Line with no intelligence that when we arrived that there
would even BE a Romulan Supply Line, all on a hunch.....
And I was, to my surprise, right!
<i>((You thought to doubt Mr. Spock???  Only thing that would have been more
foolish would be allowing Mr. Spock's advice to go unheard!))</i>
Not only have we liberated Vulcan, but we can temporarily hold it long enough
to commission a troop transport to defend Earth.
On top of that, we almost scuttled a front line Romulan warbird.... almost!...
Damn!....
It gets better, the Romulans have moved some of their forces away from Earth toward
Ferengar and our Ferengi allies have taken a Romulan space station and have a shot
at a former Klingon planet if they can get a little help from the Andorians.
We can only hope...
I am ordering Lt. Uhura to compic a message to the Andorians to request their
help in liberating a former Klingon planet from the Romulans for the Ferengi...
We can only try...

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note that Doug Kent has moved back to the Woodmeadow address.
And in doing so, Doug guessed right in moving to Ruh 
(wood meadow equals black forest.... well, ***I*** thought it
was good....) and bouncing
a large chunk of the Turkish attempted moves.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We have a new proposal for the ET Phone Home draw.
If you vote for this draw, you send ET home safe and sound, if you
don't (you mean, nasty person) you make ET and everyone else continue
to suffer with this game.
Failure to vote is the same as consigning ET to this hell called
Secrets for more time..... ;-)
