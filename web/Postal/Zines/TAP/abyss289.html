<br /><br />I've finally had the assistance of the Boardman Number and Miller Number
Custodian to get the game finishing statistics for the ended games.
Thanks, Tom Howell, and welcome back!!!
But I've not had time to get them into <i>TAP</i> format, so we're going to
do that next time.
I'm not going to bore you all (again, for many of you) with my stories
of my crashed Hard Disk, as it seems every single postal publisher is
filled with these stories.
Suffice it to say that my story was pleasanter than most as I lost
no files and only lost about a week of time in backing up and reinstalling
files and programs.
I now have a fast new hard disk in my laptop.
I've pushed the deadlines back a week to compensate.

Tim Haffey has started a new postal Dip szine. 
So far, most of the interest in it has come from non-US people.  
Come on, you US Postal Dippers, show your interest and get into 
Tim's szine (Tim also is the editor of <i>Diplomacy World</i> of course.
Anyway, <i>Who Do You Trust?</i> is monthly and costs $3 per issue or
$36 per year, those overseas orders cost $48 per year and he wants
all subs in US funds (though of course you can use the International
Subscription Exchange below to do that).  Games are free.
You can reach Tim at: Timothy R. Haffey, Sr., 810 53rd Avenue, Oakland, CA  94601,
go sub now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Also, Tim Snyder has the new issue of the <i>Zine Register</i> out.
That will go up on the Pouch web site in the Postal section as soon as I get
this issue all straightened out.
Finally, Tom Howell has returned from his six month hiatus and so 
I can get a Boardman Number for my new game!!!
See below.
And Tom Howell's szine is back out too.

<b>THE 2004 DIPLOMACY HOBBY AWARDS</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the 22nd year of the Diplomacy Hobby Awards and I'm pleased and proud
to continue to chair the committee (and act as treasurer for producing plaques
for the winners).  The rest of the committee currently consists of:
Fred Davis, Gary Behnen, Melinda Holley, Jamie Dreier, Paul Kenny, Mark Stretch, 
and Robert Lesco.
The awards given have varied over the years but currently has these five
awards, the first four are awarded by voting from the entire hobby and the last
Lifetime Achievement Award is determined by the Hobby Awards Committee.
There were 64 voters this year, who appeared to put a great deal of effort
into researching and making considered votes.
All 32 nominees across the four awards are to be saluted for their efforts on
behalf of the hobby.
See the entire ballot at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/2004HobbyAwardsBallot.pdf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now to the winners:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The Don Miller Memorial Award for Meritorious Service to the Hobby for
2004 goes to Christian Shelton</b> for developing and running the Dip BOUNCED game playing
site.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The Rod Walker Award for Literary Achievement in the Hobby for 2004 goes to
Manus Hand</b> for his latest Sherlock Holmes article,
"Solution to the Curious Case of the False Start", which appeared in the 
2004 Spring Movement issue of <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i>.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The John Koning Memorial Award for the Best Player in the Diplomacy Hobby
for 2004 goes to Yann Clouet</b>, who won the 2004 World DipCon in Birmingham, UK.
He has now won this award for the second year in a row, if
he wins it again next year (third year in a row) he is retired from
further consideration for the award and would join the other past three time winner Gary
Behnen in that honor.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The Fred Hyatt Memorial Award for the Best GamesMaster in the Diplomacy
Hobby for 2004 goes to Cal White</b>, who has done a lot of the GM work on
Dip BOUNCED this year and also is well known as a Postal GM.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Kathy Byrne Caruso Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement in the
Diplomacy Hobby is awarded irregularly by the committee in honor of Kathy
Byrne Caruso, who perhaps was the greatest player in the hobby in the 1980's,
who also happened to be a woman.  It is named after her since she lost
her battle with Cancer and was lost to the hobby forever a few years ago.  
Our continuing condolences go to John Caruso and their families who have
to live without Kathy's powerful personality on a daily basis.
The Committee did not award this
last year and this year decided to give two awards.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The first Kathy Byrne Caruso Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement
in the Diplomacy Hobby is the first one we've given posthumously, to Don Turnbull.</b>  
Don was editor of the first postal
Diplomacy szine in the UK, Albion, back in 1969 and thus started the British
postal hobby.  He remained active through the 1980's and passed away recently.
We will be giving his award to his widow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>The Kathy Byrne Caruso Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement
in the Diplomacy Hobby this year also goes to Buz Eddy.</b>  
Buz has served the hobby well in a variety of
capacities and is presently retiring from his major duties and beginning to pass
off the hobby organization he formed to others.  Buz primarily is
receiving this award for his work on the North American Diplomacy Federation (NADF)
organization and web site, but also for all his contributions to the Diplomacy Hobby
over the years.
He is now in the process of retiriing from the NADF and passing off duties
to David Maletsky and Doug Scott.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My thanks to all the winners AND all of the nominees, who were really tremendous
this year and made the choices really, really tough for all the voters
and the committee.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count.

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the

You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JOHN SMYTHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm about to start putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, starting
with someone who SHOULD be relatively easy to find, since he's been "around"
in recent years, and then working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
So, let's really find John, I'll be shocked if you can't do it, and
it's worth fifty bucks!!!
Only one more issue at the fifty buck price.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Map Collection, ERC Library, University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
That's a relatively new address adjustment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim,
I realized I haven't written a decent prison update letter in a few months,
so I decided I'd take advantage of this holiday weekend to let my one or 
two fans know what's going on in the world of B.O.P. in general, and Camp
McKean in particular.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When I last wrote, I was working as an orderly in my building, in
charge of the cleaning chemicals and supplies.
I am no longer working there.
The entire orderly sustem is one hustle after another.
Inmates paying other inmates to do their jobs.
Inmates paying the head orderly not to have a real job at all.
I just got tired of it.
<i>((One would think that Diplomacy skills would come in handy
in this, but hey, I hear you...))</i>
The breaking point came when the inmate who ran the chemical cage
on nights and weekends was fired for some reason or other
(actually, he wasn't fired, just given a more tedious orderly job).
But the head orderly decided that rather than replace him, he'd change
my job to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Whenever someone needed cleaning supplies, they had to come to me.
10PM?
Wake me up.
Weekends?
It didn't matter.
After a week or two of that, I'd had enough.
I went to the CO in charge of orderlies on the first day when
snow flurries were falling and asked to be transferred to landscaping
(which in the winter is basically just shoveling snow).
Little did I know how difficult it was to volunteer for what is usually
a punishment duty.
In the end I had to get three signatures and endure shakes of the head
and comments like "what's wrong with you?" from the Admin. personnel.
My boss, who I'll refer to as Burger, since that is what most inmates
call him, is generally regarded as a hard ass.
After he signed my transfer, one of my pals (who already worked for him)
said, "Hey, Burger, that kid you just signed for?
You know he's borderline Section 8?"
To which I'm told he replied, "You think?
Duh!
He volunteered for Landscaping!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Truth be told, changing jobs is the best thing I've done since
I came to McKean.
I don't mind work, it makes my day go by faster.
Burger hasn't given me a single problem, because I do my job and
show up on time.
The snow is OK, it's the cold which can be troublesome...
the other morning it was fifteen below zero until the sun came up.
But I get exercise, fresh air, keep busy, I can sing while I work
and nobody cares, I get paid more ($40 last month compared to 
$15 as an orderly), and at 2:30PM my shift is over no matter 
<b>how</b> hard it's snowing.
No more being forced out of bed at 10:30 PM for a trash bag, or 6AM
on a Sunday for some clean rags!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other change in my schedule is I've started the Commercial Food
Preparation Vo-Tech class here at McKean.
At Allenwood, there were no Vo-Tech programs offered - the Business
and Horticulture programs having been cancelled long ago.
McKean still has Food Prep and a computer class, for the time
being anyway.
I've always loved to cook, and this gives me the opportunity to
learn some large-scale and commercial aspects.
Plus I spend three hours a week in an actual kitchen, which sort
of reminds me what it feels like to be a human being again.
It's a ten month program, and I plan to stick with it to the
end at this point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The stress levels in all B.O.P. facilities, and McKean in particular,
continue to rise.
This is on both the inmate and the officer side.
For the staff, the biggest culprit seems to be budget constraints.
The B.O.P. is being forced to make do with less money each year,
while the prisoner population continues to increase.
There is bound to be a breaking point somewhere, but I don't know
where it is.
<i>((Anyone dealing with domestic federal budget issues sees this.
The Dept. of Veterans Affairs, where I work on one of my two jobs,
is also in that same boat, though it is veteran patients increasing
and their medical needs increasing.
As an observer, I do think it is interesting watching everything keep
ratcheting up across the government.
It is the harder to measure stuff that is suffering, of course.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the inmates, the causes of stress are fourfold at McKean.
This list does not include the general stress from the holidays, being
away from our friends, families, and loved ones.
Nor does it include boredom, which is rampant as usual but even more so now.
There is really <b>nothing</b> to do here, especially in the winter.
TV rooms are tiny and packed, no card or game playing is allowed,
except in the Rec building (which closes at 9PM and where there are
only enough tables for maybe four groups of people at once).
I spend my time in my cubicle, reading or writing letters.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first of the four problems is continued overcrowding.
These buildings (Units E and F) were originally built to hold
about 75 inmates each.
Right now, F holds nearly 180, E closer to 170.
Aside from zero privacy, constant noise, and cleanliness issues,
the facilities themselves are just not sufficient.
I regularly wait on line close to an hour for a phone
(longer towards the beginning fo the month).
That is to make a phone call of 15 minutes or less.
And if nobody is home, you have no option but to go back to the
end of the line.
Since the phones are turned off before count times, this can really
be a problem for someone like me who lives in a different time zone.
Here is a typical example: Heather works until 6PM, which is 7PM
here.
She won't be home until around 8PM here.
I have to get on line around 7PM or 7:30PM, depending on how long
I estimate my wait will be.
If I don't time it right, my turn comes up to early, and I go
back to the end of the line.... <i>((I'm presuming people watch
and won't let you sneak BACK a place or two in line, which would 
seem the logical thing to do.... I do understand that once you
dial, you're stuck.))</i>
or my turn comes too late, because around 8:30PM they shut the phones
off prior to the 9PM count.
Then you have to get back on line - a <b>new</b> line - to call.
But the phones stay off until about 9:30PM, and if an inmate wasn't where
they were supposed to be, some CO's "accidentally" see that the phones
stay off until 10PM or later.
And at 11:30PM they go off for the night.
This, plus the fact that I pay 23 cents a minute for direct-dial calls
(almost $70 a month if I use my full 300 minute monthly allotment) makes
the phone a great sense of stress.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course, this doesn't even include the frequent 15 minute or longer
waits for bathroom stalls during the morning (we have 6 stalls in a 
building of 180 inmates), or the long lines at any of the four washing
machines.
The point is, this place is crowded and getting more so!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The second cause of stress here is the Residential Drug and Alcohol
Program (RDAP).
When Allenwood cancelled their program, McKean because the only camp
in the Northeast district to offer the program.
Consequently, the waiting list is a major problem.
The way it works is the inmates with the least number of months
remaining on their sentence get in first.
But people designated for the program arrive with seemingly random
release dates.
In general, you used to expect to start the program when you had between
27 and 24 months left to serve.
Right now at McKean, it is more like 22 months or less, and growing 
shorter by the week.
The longer it takes to get into the program, the longer it is before you
get home.
Inmates keep mental lists of their place in line, i.e. "I'm fifth now
for the April class".
When new inmates arrive, the first two questions they hear, over and over,
are, "Are you here for the program?" and "How short are you?"
Inmates with less than 24 months left when they arrive are referred to as 
"shorties" or "bumpers" (because they bump everyone down a spot on
the list).
As the next class approaches, stress levels increase... one by one inmates
who were counting on making the upcoming roster discover they wait,
consequently they'll be here a month or two longer than they thought
(at least).
It is an all-consuming topic of conversation, and for most of us we'd just
as soon not think about it.... but we can't help it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The third stress factor is Blakely vs. Washington State.
<i>((Which, for any of you living in a hole, has now been decided....))</i>
This is a case currently before the US Supreme Court, which will determine
if some or all of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional.
The court already decided that a similar system in Washington State is
unconstitutional, now it will rule of the Federal level.
There are so many issues at work, a decision could have very narrow
or very broad applications.
Also in question is whether any such decision will apply not just to 
court cases, but also to plea bargains, and also whether any decision
will be in any way retroactive.
Personally, I doubt this case will change my sentence, but a large
number of inmates (both rationally and irrationally) are putting a 
lot of hope and a lot of mental energy into the outcome of this case.
We've been waiting for a decision since early November, and each week the 
tension grows.
It won't end until the decision and any ramifications become public,
at which point new stresses will replace them as countless inmates
try to file appeals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, the latest stress exacerbation: smoking.
On January 17th, 2005 all B.O.P. institutions will 
become smoke free.
With that in mind, tobacco products (including chew) stopped being
sold at commissary approximately two weeks ago.
Tempers are flaring as inmates' supplies run short, and
"black market" prices skyrocket.
Even non-smokers like me suffer, because of the anxiety the
smokers experience.
I expect to see more fights, more theft, more trouble in general.
Personally, it seems to me the B.O.P. could have chosen a better
time of year to do this than the holidays, but nobody asked my opinion!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I guess that's all I wanted to cover this time aroudn.
In football, I'm hoping the Super Bowl includes anyone but New England
and Philly.
Pphpht!!
<i>((You didn't get THAT wish....))</i>
The wild card spots aren't set yet, but I'll be rooting <b>slightly</b>
for Green Bay, Carolina, New Orleans, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh.
I just hope for some good games.
Go Texas Rangers - have they signed anybody?
<i>((Not really..... we'll see how they do.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Commenting on my thrown out claim that 
there aren't really all that many ex-Little League World Series
stars now starring in MLB....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not necessarily true - why, the league I played in had its own Major League 
success story.  Okay, it was only Buddy Biancalana (although he did get a 
World Series ring), and the team from our league never even got out of 
district (mainly because back then it was single elimination and our 
pitchers were hobbled by being one of very few leagues that outlawed 
pitching curve balls, because it was felt that it wrecked pitchers' arms at 
that age).  
<i>((Just to be clear, you are citing an example of what I was talking about,
actually.
I wasn't claiming that MLB players didn't play Little League when they were
younger, just that signing the Little League World Series players wasn't
such a good deal because the MLBers didn't get there very often.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wasn't aware Little League had that many problems, unless 
they still have the foreign-born player age certification problem.  (There 
is one crazy rule that's always been in the Little League tournament rules: 
once a team plays a game, no team can protest the use of any illegal 
players in any previous game - otherwise, pretty much the entire tournament 
would have to be replayed.  As a result, the year a team from the 
Philippines "won" the World Series only to forfeit their championship when 
it was revealed weeks later that they had players from multiple districts, 
that year's tournament became, for all intents and purposes, a USA-only event.)
<i>((I was referring to the whole idea of taking 12 year olds and putting
them into an international tournament with TV coverage and local hype.
Have you ever had a local team in it?
Probably you have.... well, some RI teams have been doing very well lately
and the hype has really been way over the top and seems inappropriate 
attention and pressure for kids that young.
That's what I meant.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((In response to Goz's admonition that Kurt
Busch did NOT have the NASCAR title sewn up until he completed the
last lap of the last race, so he can't see where I thought he "locked
it up early"....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually, it could have been one position - had Jimmie Johnson won the last 
race instead of coming in second (worth 10 points less than first instead 
of five, starting in 2004), he would have won the Cup by 2 points.
<i>((Here, Boob sticks his foot in mouth again... yeah, well, who cares?
I'll stand on my Russ Rusnak Mickey Mouse shoes.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And then on my college basketball comments.... by the way, Providence
College lost at least two more heartbreakers that they coulda, shoulda
won since I wrote.... but at least Ryan Gomes is now just playing the
game in front of him.
I've never seen a string of bad luck in any sport in such a short period
of time.
At least in the Red Sox case, such heartbreaks were stretched out over
decades....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually, they've pretty much already determined this year's "real" NCAA 
men's basketball champions: whichever Big 10 team manages to host an NIT game.  
<i>((I like it, money is the only measure that counts....))</i>
Under the NCAA's system for distributing the men's basketball money 
(50% is divided among the Division 1 conferences, with each conference 
getting 1 share out of about 750 for each team in the tournament from 
1999-2004, and 1 for each win in those years, except in the Final Four and 
the preliminary round (the 64-65 "don't call it a play-in - the NCAA 
actually had play-ins the first year they went to 64" game), but if a 
school switches conferences, it doesn't take its already-earned shares to 
the new conference), each Big 10 school gets about $1.6 million.  (Even the 
Southern conference gets $100,000 per team.)  Other than that, pretty much 
the only way a school can make post-season basketball money is to host an 
NIT game (you only get expenses if you are in the NCAA 
tournament).  Meanwhile, the teams in the women's tournament get expenses, 
and, er, that's it, except that host schools in the first four rounds get a 
percentage of the receipts as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Games in <i>TAP</i> generally are names after songs by the band, the
Mekons, and this game will not be an exception.
I thought it would be fun to name this one "Spirals of Paranoia", I've
meant to use that one as a game name for some time.
"Spirals of Paranoia" is a song on the country punk record 
<i>Retreat from Memphis</i>.
This song has a spiraling structure that builds up tension as you
might expect.
I was going to choose the next song on the record, "Missing You All",
which is about the most depressing, lonely, isolated Delta Blues
song I've ever heard.... brilliant.
But we'll go with "Spirals of Paranoia".
Not to say I'm trying to create anything, but this IS Diplomacy.

I agreed.  France opened into the Channel in Spring 1901, 
setting up his army for a convoy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I told Italy and Germany that France had lied, and France agreed he 
lied.  How can you trust what he says?  Germany wanted to know exactly

share his centers with you, and you will get -- " Opps!  The 15 
minutes for diplomacy gong [my oven timer] went off, so the rules state 
you can not even wince or blink after the gong.  You have 2 minutes to 
get in your orders.

So, Italy and Germany attacked France and put him into a bad position, 
losing Marseilles, Belgium, and Burgundy.  However, I attacked Germany 
and took two centers from him, not losing to France, who did not write 
his orders properly to make the convoy.

Germany says, "Hey, you lied.  You attacked me instead of France."  I 
replied that I did not lie.  I said that "If we ally as a team ... ", 
and we obviously did not ally as a team since I attacked you.

1) Get orders for spring in quickly, sorry for the short turnaround, I'll
delay the game if I have to, but try to get them in.
Thanks!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to SEAN): We are both right!
Both Russia and France do, in fact, suck!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN to JEFF AND THE REST): Well, this game was a complete disaster, plan and 
execution wise, for me, lol.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MUNICH-WORLD): Hofbrauhaus is reclaimed!  Liters of beer fill the streets (ever 
so briefly before they are quaffed).  Germany is again willing to consider any 
and all offers, although we might not remember what we promised last night in the
cruel morning light.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS, EPISODE 8, "ALL GOOD THINGS", A CONVERSATION, KIRK AND SPOCK):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Have you had any luck in transforming us back to human form?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Truthfully, Captain, I don't have a clue.
Furthermore, what's the point?
Our Klingon "allies" have been virtually destroyed, we just lost the Ferengi
Starship "Bad Deal", and we are under attack by the Perpendicular Universe
Federation, the intelligent, although not so trustworthy, Tribbles, and an unknown
Vulcan like race.
Our own universe according to sensor logs never existed, although
we keep receiving this silly message from Q informing us of the 
Federation defeat.
<i>((Yeah, we finally dealt with that this issue, with some prodding and
assistance from the Boardman/Miller Number Custodian, Tom Howell.))</i>
We surrender!
OK?!
The one ally we do have, the Children of Tamari, are too far away to help us,
and sensor logs indicate that they are also under attack by the Tribbles and
some other race we believe to be the Breen.
The only good news is that the Tribbles have overextended themselves.
They lost a Starbase in a deal with the now restored Federation and 
are not going to have the resources to maneuver all their starships.
They are ripe for invasion.
If the Breen had any sense, they would attack.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Lt. Uhura interrupts...)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U - Captain Kirk!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What have you got?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U - I analyzed the communication array from the "Bad Deal" before 
she was destroyed.
All hands escaped in escape pods and they have identified the Vulcan 
like race that attacked us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - Who are they?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U - (with dramatic hesitation)... ROMULANS!!!
(bad dramatic Trek music in the background)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to WORLD): So, let me get this straight.
Italy attacks Germany, then France, and now Turkey.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
The upcoming Fall 1918 is that point.
Even if Turkey is missing TWO of its home centers in Winter 1918,
I think we are still going to advance to the next level of
voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be
allowed with failure to vote equalling a yes.
If any other significant movement or centers change hands
then that will be another story, of course.
This does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is ahead of this pace).
Also, note that four of the teams are within eight replenishment 
points of each other, two ties each at 337 and 329.  Note that one
337 and one 329 replenisher has a lot of points, and one of each
doesn't.  
It will be interesting to see which approach works best on the
way to the Finish Line.
Ride on!!!
