This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Let's get the new Diplomacy game going.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

<i>((For upcoming cons around the world: http://diplom.org/Face/cons/index.php, 
but note that some of the Americans have stopped posting the tournaments there.
Shame, shame, shame...
The Chicago hobby continues on its active track:
they had a great CODCon and Weasel Moot is coming up on July 26th and 27th.
Although we know that Carnage in Vermont will end off the Nor'Easter
sequence of events the first weekend in November, the rest of the year
in the Northeast is clarifying slowly.
Cheers to Christian Pedone and the Philly crowd for organizing
a patriotic July 4-6 Philly Massacre again this year.
The website is at www.philadelphiamassacre.com, check it out.  
Rob Premus hasn't said anything about his tournament though either.
But expect updates in this space... Tempest will be coming up on
Columbus Day weekend as usual too.
I think most of you have seen it, but David Hill's article on being
smoked at World DipCon (see: 
http://grantland.com/features/diplomacy-the-board-game-of-the-alpha-nerds/)
has been generating lots of commentary:
I agree with Adam Sigal and have for a long time (and this is nothing new) that 
some things could and should be done to work to invite more players into the
fun of the FTF hobby.  To think he as a rookie could walk into the World
Championships and "instantly get it" would be silly.
And of course Diplomacy is not for everyone, but as I have just lost
perhaps my best friend in the entire hobby, I look out at all of you and
know that I have more great friends than most people have a right to expect.
David Hill should have seen that all around him, and didn't quite capture that.
More on that from me in my next Diplomacy World article in a few days.
It is NOT too late for you to write one, get one to Doug or me now!!!))</i>

I think today, as Richard Thompson is preparing for a soldout show in Newburyport
tonight (June 20th) which is halfway between my two houses and I've just passed
by on my way up here to Maine, that I regret the state of live music these days.
As RT said about this: "Well, an advantage to longevity is that I don't have to
build an audience on the back of hit records.
My audience, over time, has come from word of mouth."
I really don't think it's about getting older, but I don't really find that
any new act/singer who manages to worm their way into my consciousness does
anything as much for me as any of 100 musicians of the last half century.
I'm trying to think who the last singers who really grabbed me were.
Probably Erin McKeown or Melissa Ferrick.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((If anyone from <i>TAP</i> or <i>ES</i> has ideas 
for more things to talk about here let me know.
I do have five or six ideas lined up here already that I just have to write.
As a lookahead, the Ossipee Valley Music Festival, that is a couple of miles
west of my Maine lake camp, is coming up even closer now at the end of July, 
http://www.ossipeevalley.com/ and the lineup is looking great for that.))</i>

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
And then I could have soloed the second game, but well, I can't exactly 
say how I did it, but the Canadian player soloed there, with help from me.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals SHOULD start 
in September.
But you still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm not doing an NMR on this restart, so I've delayed the game. 
I also think there is SOME interest, but not codified to end the game.
Let's be specific.  Vote on a DIAS that includes all five of you, vote on
an EF that includes two of you.  I think you're going to have to talk to
each other to get to consensus, as there are active votes against draws.
There was confusion about DIAS vs. EF though.
I don't announce draw votes and if you don't vote, you veto, so I can 
pretty much guarantee the game will NOT end in July unless there is effort
made to get votes in to end it.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We have TWO players getting dropped from the pack in the same turn.
No one else seems in immediate risk, I keep all the riders on the board.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to RIDERS): But no press...

Kendo Nagasaki games in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> 
continue to multiply like weeds...
I'd like to get more people engaged here, not just the usual suspects from Doug's games.
The full rules for Where in the World is Kendo Nagasaki are
in: http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/es58.pdf.
The player who was closest for Turn 5 has been notified by E-Mail.
There were numerous complaints that my TURN 4 hint was confusing, I was more adventurous
with my TURN 5 hint, AND I revised and clarified the TURN 4 hint.  Lots for you to absorb.

<br /> <b>HINT to the Person with the Closest Geographic Guess:</b> Unfortunately, you are very
much dead, while I am very much alive.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
I think I would like to write this month about why I am still here, on the eve of the
350th issue of this thing next month, and why you all are so very precious and special
to me.
Of course, Don Williams' passing put me into this kind of mood.
I think there are three or four things that keep me welded into the Diplomacy
hobby and even if you all left, I'd probably stay.
First and foremost is the game itself.  
It's definitely not a game for everyone, you have to enjoy grabbing onto the essence
of your being and twisting it for fun.
And then you have to not hold grudges about it, so even after someone slaps you
upside the head four or five times, you still sit down and laugh with him about it
over a beer.
But I still think it is the best game ever, I still think that it is THE game that
will prove if Artificial Intelligence is really possible some day, I still think
that it puts baseball to shame for its failure rate (it is the best answer to what
other game do you fail 7 times out of ten and are still one of the top players in the
world), and a host of other things that are special about it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Second, is mostly about MY life.
I have an insane life, no doubt about it, I should be committed for signing up to it.
I have two ostensibly half time jobs, both of which feel like full time jobs most of the
time.  
I also have three additional part time jobs that are somewhat lumpy in terms of the 
time they take, but when they demand time, they demand it.
I'm also on about five non-profit boards, one professional one and the others mostly
about social services of various kinds.
And then there is this.
Edi Birsan famously said about Diplomacy and vices that one should concentrate one's
vices and that Diplomacy was the best single one going.
You can spin that a bit this way and that, but I surely WOULD be insane if it wasn't 
for this and for all of you.
Thanks!!
But you can ask legitimately why I'm still here and how I keep up a family life, and
how I can do what I do.
I'm up at my Maine lake house as a type this, that's another essential to my sanity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Third, is about all of you.
I have a lot of friends from various parts of my life, but there are dozens of you
that I would trust (as we have played this GAME of trust) with almost anything.
The game lets me (whether you like it or not) know a whole lot about you, as you
know a whole lot about me.
You will note that I do NOT show up regularly at the FTF Diplomacy Tournaments, though
I have found my way to lots of them over the years (the next Chicago World DipCon looks
like the next one I'm pointing toward that I just can't miss).
When I retire (probably from one of my half time jobs first), 
I surely will start winding my way to lots more of them.
I find that I still enjoy them immensely, and I love trying to hone my ability to 
play multiple boards in a tournament at the same time, maybe more than I want to
hone or find an ability to win a tournament outright.
Most of you have no idea how much you mean to me severally and individually.
I miss the people I don't interact much with any more, like John Caruso.
I love that some people, like Heath Gardner, come back after not talking to them
for a decade or more at a time.
Some people are silent observers (yes, I do know you're out there!!!) while
others seem like they're just always there around this szine, 
like Rick Desper, Doug Kent, Jack McHugh,
and Melinda Holley.
Then, what in a way is even weirder is that I bounce around all the parts of
the Diplomacy hobby that I can find, and there are lots of other people who
I am really, really close to in the Diplomacy hobby, but have no idea about
TAP, maybe don't even know it exists, but certainly don't read it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, thanks to you all, I really appreciate everything you are and will be.</b>
