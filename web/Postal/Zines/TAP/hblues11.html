<p>I'll be running an orphaned game here soon. It's Hellsmouth, which was
formerly run by Mark Kinney. I also have about five signed up for my next
Diplomacy game start come on, sign up, it'll be good for you.
<p>The article this time is on the ship after which the Outpost game is
named interesting history though certainly not one of the most distinguished
ships of the past 100 years or so.

<p><b><i>Peresviet</i></b></center>

<p>For some centuries, Russia has aspired to be a leading naval power.
At times she has come close to achieving this goal. Certainly, many observers
regarded the Russian fleet at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War as
being among the world's most powerful. Unfortunately for Russia, the truth
soon became evident: though bravely manned, Russia's navy was often poor
trained and led. The ships, meanwhile, were often of mediocre quality.
<p>The three <i>Peresviet </i>class battleships typified all th at was
wrong with Russian ship design at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
Of obvious French influence in an era when the French weren't building
good ships<i>, Conway's All The World's fighting Ships</i> rightly describes
the Peresviet class as a "thoroughly unsatisfactory design, both armament
and protection being poor and speed not exceptional."
<p>On a displacement of 12,683 tons, the Peresviets were undergunned with
their main armament of four 10-inch guns in two twin turrets. A secondary
armament of 11 six-inch guns was also fitted, five a side in casemates
and a single gun in the bow. An anti-destroyer battery of 11 pounders was
carried, as were five 15-inch torpedo tubes.
<p>A realtively long ship for her day,
<i>Peresviet</i> was 434 feet, 6inch
in length, with a beam of 71 feet, six inch es, and a maximum draught of
26 feet. Fitted with 32 Belleville boilers producing 15,000 horsepower,
the <i>Peresviet</i>s had a top speed of 18 to 18.5 knots. The machinery
was vertical triple expansion, and three propellor shafts were fitted.
<p>The actual look of the ships was heavily French influenced, with pronounced
tumblehome (inward curvature above the waterline). With three funnels,
and a high forecastle deck running to the main mast, the <i>Pereviet</i>
and her two sisterships looked massive, an impression enhenced by their
two large</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="588">masts and three smokestacks.
<p>The natural point of comparison for the
<i>Peresviet </i>is the British
<i>Canopus </i>class. Laid down between late 189 6 and 1898 and completed
between 1898 and 1902, the
<i>Canopus</i> and her five sisterships (<i>Albion</i>,
<i>Glory</i>, <i>Goliath</i>,
<i>Ocean</i>, and <i>Vengeance</i>) were
of 13,150 tons, with a main armament of four 12-inch guns and a top speed
of 18 knots. Their armor protection, with its main belt of six-inches of
Krupp armor extending half the length of the ship and going 14 feet deep,
was also much better than that in <i>Peresviet</i>.
<p>The <i>Peresviet</i> and her sistership
<i>Osliabia</i> were built by
the New Admiralty yard in St. Petersburg. Both wer e laid down on November
21, 1895, and launched in 1898 (May and November respectively). They entered
service in 1901 the long build time, a common characteristic of Russian
shipbuilding, was a factor in their being outclassed when they entered
service.
<p>The third ship of the class,
<i>Pobieda,</i> featured some minor improvements
in her armoring and power plant and was built by the Baltic Works in St.
Petersburg. She was laid down on August 1, 1898, launched in May 1900 and
commissioned in June 1902.
<p>Rare indeed are the warships that can claim to be sunk twice, but such
was the case with the
<i>Peresviet</i>. She was in the Far East in early
1904 when Japan attacked Russ ia. She was then badly damaged at the Battle
of the Yellow Sea on August 10, 1904 before being trapped in Port Arthur,
where she was scuttled after taking over 20 11-inch howitzer hits. The
Japanese raised and commissioned her as
<i>Sagami</i>.
<p>In 1916, with Russia in desperate need of warships to guard her White
Sea ports against possible German raids, the Russian repurchased the
<i>Peresviet</i>/<i>Sagami</i>
as well as several other vessels sunk at Port Arthur. Renamed
<i>Peresviet</i>,
she promptly ran aground off Vladivostock on May 26, 1916 and wasn't refloated
until July. Finally, on her way to her new station, she hit a mineon January
4, 1917 laid by the German U-boat minelayer <i>U 73</i> and sank 10 miles
from Port Said, Egypt
<p>The <i>Pobieda</i> was also in the Far East in 1904. She was mined on
April 13, 1904 but put back in service by mid-June. She was then damaged
at the Yellow Sea on August 10, 1904. Later, she was trapped in Port Arthur
as the Japanese laid siege to it; she sank on December 7, 1904 after taking
21 11-inch shell hits. The Japanese later raised her and put her in service
as <i>Suwo</i>. She was scrapped in 1922.
<p>The <i>Osliabia</i> was in the Baltic when the Russo-Japanese war broke
out. She sailed to the Far East with the Second Pacific Squadron, only
to be sunk at gunfire at Tsushima.
