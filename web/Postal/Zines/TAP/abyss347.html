This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

The Chicago hobby continues on its active track:
they had a great CODCon and Weasel Moot is coming up on July 26th and 27th.
Although we know that Carnage in Vermont will end off the Nor'Easter

Cheers to Christian Pedone and the Philly crowd for organizing
a patriotic July 4-6 Philly Massacre again this year.

Rob Premus hasn't said anything about his tournament though either.
But expect updates in this space... of course the big upcoming tournament,
that I will have to miss, is World DipCon at DixieCon on Memorial Day

<b>NEW FEATURE: ROCK AND ROLL BANDS AND MOMENTS THAT MATTER</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Enter the Haggis</i>: I have a "present moment" to report, well, March 22, 
to be specific.  Charlotte and I went to a semi-local venue, The Narrows 
Center in Fall River, for the first time.
It's a gorgeous mill setting, with lots of artist relationships and gallery space.
www.narrowscenter.org is their great website.
As some of you know, the bass player for Enter the Haggis is married to our niece,
so we kinda know the band and got comped in to the show.
It has been a couple of years since we've seen them, so it was fun to see how they've
grown.
I have been listening a lot to their recorded music...
I especially like the 2011 CD "Whitelake" which is their last album before they
ramped up the sound a bit.
I like loud music just fine, but the current approach (which we saw last month) 
adds a bit more electric guitar and a bit more rockabilly flavor.
The newer "The Modest Revolution" record was funded totally through Kickstarter and 
has them taking much more control over their career and their work.
The other thing that is cool about "The Modest Revolution" is the array of stories
in the songs, all motivated by articles in one issue of the Globe and Mail in 2012.
They actually did this ahead of time, chose the issue of the newspaper (hey, did they
realize newspapers are last century's medium?) and then wrote the songs once
they got the issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Frankly, it works a bit better on the record than in person where the rock
sound masks some of the detail of the stories.
The concept of writing songs about whatever was in the paper that day led to
some strange choices.
The most interesting concept song is the one "Can't Trust the News", about a
woman mountainclimber trying to escape difficulties in her life.
The hockey song "Blackout" is good and they played it just as most of the
Canadian teams were about to lose out of the playoffs.
The multi-instrumentalist talent is great here, but (and not sure if Mark is
going to read this) I think they would be better off trying to mature through their
roots and basically put away trying to be a loud rock band.
I love listening to their music more on the CDs, and so can you.  So, visit their
website www.enterthehaggis.com and think about picking up "Whitelake" first.
I drive a lot, as you all know, so I love "road songs", the great one here, 
"Headlights", strikes me as pondering this question about whether they want to
keep being a rock and roll band or a roots band.
There's a great mix of funk (especially "Let Me Go" which really lets it fly)
and blues (especially "The Hunter and the Phantom Limb" that tells a great story).
They did a bit of acoustic at the end of the show, and it was the best part of 
the show to me.
I of course wish them the best of luck going forward, it always shows that 
engagement in the rock and roll popularity contest is a big crap shoot,
and they're making a 
new CD now, and I definitely will see them again sometime soon.

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
And then I could have soloed the second game, but well, I can't exactly 
say how I did it, but the Canadian player soloed there, with help from me.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals should start any day now.
But you still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,
I can't believe that UCONN won the National Championship!  
<i>((Men's... I was rooting for Florida, but I ended up being happy with
Shabazz and their team, great to watch, interesting how it took them
so long in the season to put it together))</i>
My worst nightmare!  Of course, I'm no fan of Kentucky either.  
I told my son I couldn't watch unless someone could come up with a 
scenario where neither team won.  Certainly SU had a disappointing end to the season.  
Their lack of offense finally caught up with them.  
If they could have made just one single 3 point shot they would have 
beaten Dayton and made the Sweet 16, but they only made one jump shot the whole game!  
It was hard to watch.  All in all though it was the most enjoyable season since 2003.  
There were so many exciting games and big wins in the Dome.  
Hopefully Grant returns next year.  Given that he hasn't announced yet, 
I'm being optimistic.
<i>((Jerami Grant since has said he will enter the draft, wonder if he
would be a guy the Celtics would be interested in with their late first
round pick??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
UCONN is about to play ND for the women's title as I write this.  
I have more interest in this game than I did last night's.  
Given that Brianna Stewart is from Syracuse and I watched her play 
in high school a couple of times I'll actually be cheering for UCONN.  
Hopefully the game lives up to the hype - two undefeated teams 
who hate each other playing for the National Championship!

<i>((And of course it was the dual National Championships. 
UConn really didn't let it get close.
I always have been a fan of the UConn women's team, going way, way, way
back, so I was pleased.
Though I don't really pay as much attention to them as I did in the 1990's.
I started out paying attention to women's basketball when Connecticut native
Tracy Lis came here to Providence, and set the then Big East scoring record.
But then I grew to like Auriemma's coaching style and became a UConn women's fan 
about 20 years ago.
It's amazing that UConn now has done this twice!!!
Next up, we have our baseball commentaries for this year, finishing with mine.

I just got home from taking the dog for a walk in a park that has 
little league fields, and there was a swarm of itty bitty kids in uniforms, 
playing Tee-Ball and hitting against a pitching machine.

<i>((The Red Sox have gotten off to a very messy start, and already
they've arguably been the most screwed by this silly instant replay rule.
They has a bang-bang first base call play overturned against them!
What the heck's with that? 
Umpires judge that by the SOUND of the ball in the glove, and replay doesn't
do it with linked sound.
This is a travesty so far, another thing we can blame Bud Selig for!
I hope they fix it.  
Replay, IF they're going to use it needs to be for "big obvious mistakes"
not close plays on the basepaths.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Now, my picks.  The base picks were published before the season
started in <b>Eternal Sunshine</b> and I'm just fleshing them out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: Boston, Tampa Bay (Wild Card), New York, Baltimore, Toronto.
The Red Sox will take a while to get their offense in gear, but they have
the pitching and in the long run, pitching wills out.
I really thought the Yankees would be a disaster and climb back up later,
we will note that is NOT the way things are starting out.
If the Yankees really do have the best pitching in the division, help!!!
The Red Sox statistically DO have the best bullpen pitching so far, and that's
going to hold up, since they still don't have everyone healthy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: Kansas City, Detroit (Wild Card), Cleveland, Chicago, Minnesota.
Yuck, I'm agreeing mostly with Doug?
Not on KC, I think they break out this year and take the division.
These young teams do this before they know what hit them.  The Tigers are old
and slow and vulnerable.
Cleveland isn't as good as they could be, but mid-season moves could move them up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: Oakland, Texas, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston.  This division could be 
any which way, except that Houston is still bad, very bad.  And I don't see
how Seattle makes it all work, and Cano hasn't done anything yet. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: Washington, Atlanta (Wild Card), New York, Philadelphia, Miami.
I really like Atlanta, but Washington seems like it really is going to succeed
this time.  I think Philadelphia is going to come back a bit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Chicago.  The Cubs ARE
still a disaster, I think Cincinnati is a bit better than others do.  I don't think
Pittsburgh is going to succeed enough to be a Wild Card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: Los Angeles, San Francisco (Wild Card), San Diego, Arizona, Colorado.
I hate the Dodgers, but they WILL likely win enough to be the division winner.
I think San Diego is going to have a great season, will my Giants hold them off?
I say yes, but am I confident? No.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Playoffs: I think Boston will repeat and beat LA, at least that's what I want to happen...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Awards and Such: I like Mike Trout and Chris Sale for the individual awards in the AL,
not sure enough about NL players to say.  Only that Bryce Harper is a fraud.))</i>

1) I think I do have a call for a unanimous and anonymous vote with 
your Spring orders for skipping a Summer press season if there are
no retreats.  If there are retreats, there will be a separate Summer season,
unless everyone submits orders going ahead.
If my policies on this are unclear, please ask.
If you fail to vote on the "no separate summer" question, it is assumed
to be default to my standard separation, unless everyone submits orders to go ahead.
Note, that we HAVE a summer retreat this time.
We'll take it unless I have unanimous approval and orders in from everyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I strongly encourage Summer press.  Our press deserted us this time, 
but I will reprint the last part of our on-going story anyway.

this may help people read and follow
it better.

(PRINCE of DARKNESS, PART 12):
The Gypsy Wife was not Albanian but had adopted the country years ago.  
Her pronounced accent was a jumble of tongues that hinted of many influences

or maybe Sardinia or Cypress, perhaps from the Basque country or Armenia.  
She alluded to them all in her history.  It didn't matter to her, 
she said, as her people had not been accepted anywhere in Europe 
for more than ten centuries.  All lands were inhospitable to those 
who didn't belong.  The music in the other room spoke of that 
loneliness and alienation.  Albania, with its own tradition of not 
belonging, was not welcoming to the gypsies she said, only less 
hostile than the rest of Europe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometime in the past she had become owner of The Threshing Floor.  
The Threshing Floor was a hard-bitten tavern favored by the local 
criminal element, assorted dark figures, and few others.  
The tavern was now enmeshed in the mass of mean buildings that were Korce, 
but centuries ago had stood alone near the old city walls before the 
town had moodily crowded in around it.  
It was dark even by tavern standards and larger than any of its competitors.  
Generations ago it had been a barn, or a granary maybe.  
One story had it the Gypsy Wife had won The Floor in a duel with knives.  
Another rumor was that she'd terrified the previous owner with baleful 
readings from her tarot deck.  
A third was that it had always been in gypsy hands and she was only the 
current keeper.  It didn't matter.  
Nothing in The Threshing Floor happened without her knowledge and forbearance.  
Most patrons came to the tavern for drink and gossip, both of which flowed 
freely.  Cards, dice, and other games of chance were also a draw.  
Others came to conduct quiet business of a less than legal nature.  
I was here for none of these.  I'd come for information.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd met Lila by chance in Constantinople years ago at the top of the 
Galatian Tower in the eastern part of the city.  
We were both pursuing a Fourth Worlder known as the Al'Harradan baq-El, 
a brutal killer and blackmailer from Syria.  My client had been the 
wealthy family of one of his victims, hers a Romani chief in eastern Turkey.  
I'd needed him alive and had chased him to the Tower after an extended search 
through the Levant.  Her client wasn't as picky and she'd 
accomplished her mission when Al'Harridan baq-El met his end at her 
hands with a fall from the top of the Tower.  Defenestration.  
Messy.  Effective.  After some tense negotiation she’d allowed me to 
take the body to my clients after proving to the gypsy lord he'd 
been neutralized.  It was an uncomfortable accommodation.  
We'd both benefited.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Most of the First Sprint Points are claimed, but two more slots will
earn points for the next two riders to cross.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
