<b>SPECIAL KATHY BYRNE CARUSO MEMORIAL SECTION</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<br /><br />I'm not going to even try to organize what follows below.
The hobby shocks continue with perhaps the greatest loss of all.
Let me begin with the words of John Caruso that hit me in the
head on August 16th.

<p>
``It is with a heavy and sad heart that I write this.
If it's not a coherent letter, please excuse me.
The illness that I had mentioned to some of you was
not me - it was Kathy.
The illness was lung cancer.
Yesterday at 11PM, we lost her, 4 months after she was diagnosed.
She didn't die from the cancer but from the weakness it 
caused - it made her vulnerable to other things and some other
infection killed her.
The doctors say they may never know.
Anyway, I lost my best friend, not just my wife, and right now
I'm really hurting.
If anyone in the Dip hobby wants more data, I'm going to ask Jim Burgess 
to do me the favor and be my point man there.
I know some Dip people may want to know as well.
I'm signing off with a heavy heart.
Thanks for understanding.''

<p>
John went on to ask me to try to minimize a flood of E-Mails and
to do something like this, gathering thoughts and condolences in this
medium, where John can keep it and look at your comments as he can
muster the strength.
In recent years, the way to keep up with the Caruso family has been
through John's baseball league, which is why his E-Mail address is
commishjohn of att.net.
I have more to say interspersed below.
I am hurting for my friend John, for Francine, and for the whole family.
I'm also going to miss Kathy myself as well.
But there's lots of celebration below too and more next issue is welcome.
Send me whatever you like and I'll print it.
I'm going to let Bob Olsen and then Cal White lead off.

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Bob Olsen (Thu, 22 Aug 2002 17:52:22 EDT)</b>

<p>
Jim,
One of the first and few coherent thoughts I had about Kathy's death 
is that the best memorial would be for everyone to send in their memories and 
funny stories about her. And that <i>TAP</i> would be the best place for it. I'm 
glad to see that you're going to do something of the sort. I'll have 
something to send when I can...probably next week.

<p>
By the way I guess you never got my new address:

Dear John,

I heard about Kathy's passing and I just wanted to say that I am sorry for
your loss.  I've never lost a spouse so I can't imagine what you're going
through, but I know how I felt when I lost my father six years ago.  It's
not a good feeling, but I'm sure you'll have lots of support from family and
friends.  I wish you well in the future.

<p>
Sadly, I never met Kathy.  However, when I entered the hobby it was so 
I could play and learn to play better.
I was in awe of Kathy because she mastered the art of playing Italy.
I would look at the maps of the games she was in and marvel at her position.
How in the world did she do <b>that</b>?

<p>
I also was an admirer of her wit.
She was clever and did not suffer fools lightly-and that's what made her ``zinny" so entertaining.
Maybe as I've grown older, I've learned how to see beyond the tactics 
and appreciate the people in the hobby more.
I hope so.
People like Kathy Caruso are rare and far more valuable than the nuances 
of the game they teach us.
I am sure that most, if not all, of you were closer to her than I was.
I share in your loss and am saddened at her passing.
My prayers are with her family.

I am very sorry to hear this.  I didn't know Kathy well, but I did meet
her at a few cons years ago, and encountered her postally as well.  Not
only was she "perhaps" the greatest female player of all time, but she
was most likely the best Italy of all time, of either sex!  Plus she was
a great person, and I know she will be missed.

 <i>Ed Henry (ex-France) NMRed out</i>

<p>
 Dear JB,  Well, I couldn't very well have you thinking that
anything happened to me.
I reached a point (for about the fourth time) where I simply wasn't paying
enough attention to the games I was in-there is an obligation to
reply to letters, even if it's only to say something like "no problems here:
all boring on my front."
Once you stop answering, anything can happen:  missing deadlines, forgetting
deadlines and worst of all, getting deadlines mixed up.
<i>That's why I missed for the all-important second time in a row.</i>
When I found I had been replaced by a standby (Kathy, for the 
umpty-millionth time), I was so demoralized, I blew a few other
deadlines (and games, I'm sorry to say).

<p>
 In the interest of maintaining my reputation as the world's 
worst letter-writer, I'm going to have to cut down on my letter
writing (of course), and, by definition, my game-playing-at least by
mail.
I don't expect to <i>totally</i> disappear, but near enough.

<p>
 And, on top of everything else, Bob (my erstwhile ally)
doesn't even like baseball press.
Talk about destruction of illusions...

<p>
 I don't have much to say about the game:  this one was fairly 
easy after the relatively smooth changeover from Mike <i>((Lee))</i>
to Bob in midstream.
I'm a little sorry, and feel (mildly) guilty about having lost 
track of what was going on during the last couple of seasons-I
guess Bernie should get a little credit for out-stubborning me
(he was there a bit longer than I was).
All-in-all, it was fun while I was there, and I do appreciate all the
work you put into it.
Many thanks to all involved for an enjoyable contest.

<p>
 Special thanks to you, JB.
Hopefully, you'll hear from me again-sometime.

Sincerely, Edwin S. Henry</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
 <i>((Thanks to you too, for all the press.
I'm glad you wrote, because I was feeling guilty that I pushed you out
of the game.
(I know, SLUDGE, I'm being Boobish again, but leave me alone...)
I admit to a perverse pleasure in bringing Kathy out of the blue
to team with SLUDGE for the draw.
I did try to call you on NMR insurance, but I didn't try very hard.
I was somewhat worried that you would be angry.
I'm glad you're not, and I'll be happy to have you back anytime.
<b>[[Hmmm, shouldn't we look for Ed Henry next??]]</b>))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>SLUDGE Olsen (standby England) win</i>

<p>
 There are some standby positions so easy, so well-prepared that
even <i>I</i> can't manage to screw them up.
This one, for instance.
<i>((Oh, come on!
You almost blew the win after Ed Henry handed it to you.
There's that cutthroat win-only player that I knew was lurking beneath
your benign pudgy exterior!!!))</i>
On coming in long about 1904 
<i>((Spring 1904, it was))</i>
it was quite clear that before I showed
up there had been an English-French alliance, and that England had a
winning hand in the north.
So all I had to do was follow through with blind, mindless, toadyish
stubbornness, and it all fell into place.

<p>
 During the course of this game, I received the single most remarkable
letter I've ever gotten in my entire Dip career.
Long about 1908, when I was at about 14 centers
<i>((actually going from 10 to 13))</i>
and he was at 2 going on 1, Bernie Oaklyn wrote and offered to
play for a strong second in the game, to my win.
He challenged me to build him up to 16 units-eliminating all the
other countries-and take the 18-16 win.
Regrettably, I was not up to this challenge, but I certainly wish
Bernie every success in someday finding someone stupid enough
to agree to such an arrangement.
<i>((Randy Ellis tried it once with me...but he deserted me, so
I was forced to stab his successor.
Now I am just stupid enough to turn the tables.
What do you say Stephen?
You can ignore that, Bob))</i>
Meanwhile, he did at least succeed in convincing me that there still
is something new under the sun, and that sheer, unadulterated chutzpah
still lives in the world.

<p>
 The actual plan from day one was to keep pushing until
somebody pushed back; despite my occasional tactical ineptitude,
nobody really did, and it was a 2-way with France all the way.
<i>((What 2-way?
You won, Bob.
Don't you remember??
I thought you were just kidding before, but I think you're serious.
Congratulations on your second win!!))</i>
It was a shame that Ed Henry played the game almost to the end
and then dunderheaded out, but at least I had the satisfaction
of achieving a 2-way with Kitton Byrne.
<i>((SLUDGE.
You ripped the Kitton to shreds.
I haven't seen a more vicious, lying stab since the last coming
of da Sleaze.
Have you blanked it out?
You poor mudball.
I've heard some rumours that your memory has been faulty lately.
Have you thought about some professional help?
I hear Ollie North is looking for a job, maybe he'd like to beat
the truth out of you.
When you get mad, you can return the favor...))</i>
Of course it was only a standby position...just as our other 2-way
was &#246;nly" a variant.
But at least thanks to Jim-Bob, I have not been forced to listen to
a lot of bad-mouthered <i>((sic, and sic he is...))</i> slanderous
abuse about "winning" and suchlike vicious lies...not like some 
<i>((other))</i> GM's I could mention, GM's who can't even claim
the slightest vestige of mammalianism, who habitually blow up
nuclear reactors, and who furthermore...
<i>((I thank you for the kind words concerning my honest and
kind demeanour.
I hope you don't mind this friendly interruption, but the tirade
against this unnamed GM goes on for 86 more pages.
Do you have any idea how much it would cost to print and mail
such a voluminous outpouring of vituperation?
According to the new Berchian standards, I am within my rights
to return it to you for editing.
I exorcise my right regarding the present work.
I don't understand, Bob, who could make you lose your cool like this?
I hope you will find it in your cool and sludgy heart to forgive this
person.
I'm concerned for your mental health.
This isn't another example of failing memory is it?
I would be more than happy to print another attempt to resolve this
problem you seem to have about winning.
You did win this game.
Congratulations!!))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Kitton Byrne (standby France) win</i>

<p>
 This two way draw really proves what a great diplomat I am.
Obviously, convincing a strong England not to stab my poor France
took a lot of flirting.
<i>((I'm getting very confused.
You slashed that poor helpless SLUDGE to ribbons with your razor
sharp claws.
He seems to be very confused about this.
At least you were kind enough to put him under before you did it.
Flirting, indeed!
I know this is just another win for you, but trying to be modest
will not help one iota.
I'm the GM. 
I know what happened in this game!!
I do, I do, I do!!!))</i>

<p>
 It is very hard to come into a game as a standby and find
out that Iron Fist, oops, I mean Bob Olsen is holding your very life
in his hands.
I found myself hitting my head against a wall.
I'd say, ``Honey, go for the win, take my centers", and he'd reply,
``I could never stab you Honey".
I knew I'd never convince him to take the win when he refused to
build three units.
Three units which could have ripped thru France!
So I graciously accepted his offer to share in his victory.
<i>((Right, and then you ripped out his heart.
Real nice move, Bloodsucker!!
Boy are you mean.))</i>

<p>
 The real shame of the whole thing is that I didn't get to pound
Pops into the ground.
I wouldn't have minded giving him a few swift kicks after his press!
Actually, I would have enjoyed it!

<p>
 As for the cute little elf, well I wasn't going to hurt him.
I wanted him to help stamp out Pops.

<p>
 As for you, Boob, next time you tell me I definitely won't
get a position, how about keeping your word!

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Peter J. Gaughan IV (Turkey) survival</i>

<p>
 I will always remember this as ``my game with Uncle Bernie", 
and to a lesser extent with Carl Russell.
Very early on, I bought Carl's story and stabbed Bernie - in the same
turn, Italy and Austria came after me, taking Bulgaria.
Fine, I says, and immediately made profuse apologies to Mr. O,
begging for a re-alliance.
We fought back the lying Austrian, and I was in the Ionian in
Winter '03 thanks to Italian preoccupation with France.

<p>
 From 1903 to 1908 I got two letters from Bernie for every
one I sent him (plus a phone call while I was at my parents', in
Northern California, for Christmas two years ago!).
Once I waded through all the jingoism about France being England's
puppet and how Russia was going to succeed at this and that, I got
some very good tactical advice.

<p>
 Alas, by the time Eric came in and set up the R-A-T, an E-F
conclusion was certain.
I supported it until Fall 1908 and then went for the biggest
survival I could get.
I realize Eric and Bernie will think only evil thoughts about 
``Father Peter" for a long time, but last-gasp defenses just don't make 
a lot of sense.

<p>
 <i>((Thanks, Pete, for sticking with the game to the end.
As the first game I ever GMed, it was always fun to have you around.))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Eric Ozog (standby Austria) survival</i>

<p>
 When Jim-Bob asked me to take over Austria I first thought
``aw shit, I don't want to play", and also considered doing a pirate
crusade and suiciding out.
Then I thought I'd make the best of it and go for survival.
I enlisted Russian and Turkish support, figuring I could get
the priest (Father Gaughan) and the devil himself (Uncle Bernie)
together to form a stalemate vs. Olsen's and Henry's strong E/F.
It worked for awhile, but a stalemate was impossible and the
R/A/T fell apart, culminating with Gaughan stabbing me, to grab
what he could.
I don't blame him one bit, ``Father, you know not what you do".

<p>
 My congrats to Bob and Kathy, it was especially fine tactics
and strategy, Mom, you used to earn that French position.
And I know you at least would have kept me alive had the game gone on.
Henry certainly would not have, bless his soul, wherever he may be.
Too bad I arrived 3 game years too late, for I could have had France!
No thanks to you, Jim-Bob, but a good GMing job.
You're turning professional; it sort of complements your PhD.

 Dear Jim-Boob, Hope you're enjoying (what's left of) your summer!
If you're anything like me, you're enjoying it from the comfortable depths
of an air-conditioned home.
<i>((Grrr, I can't stand your kool kind.
See my press in the next
<b>Flick of the Wrist</b> for more on how I hate my unconditioned heat...
<b>[[Boy, am I glad I have air conditioning now!!!]]</b>))</i>
The humidity around here is something fierce this year, and I hear that
extends all the way up and down the Coast.
(*Sigh*)
My kind of summer afternoon is the intoxicating 80-degree, low-humidity,
cloudless one which encourages trips to the lake or the mountains.
All the weather now encourages is sleep!
<i>((Easy for you to say!
At least you CAN sleep.
I'm happy that summer is almost over.

 I'll bet you this letter is going to arrive just after an
edition of <i>TAP</i> goes out in the mail.
<i>((No bets, you're right as usual.
If we keep up this psychic contact (you also sensed the subject of the
editorial you hadn't seen), Steve and Charlotte are going to get very

I seem to be good at that - and, without regular deadlines from you,
I'll probably continue to be good at that!
(Hint, hint.)
<i>((Oh, come on, what more can I do?
I target getting <b>TAPs</b> out at the same time as each issue of
<b>The Boob Report</b> (twice in each five week period), knowing that
I'll fall short of the target and get issues out on average once every
four weeks.
But I won't stick this on a regular schedule that I can't keep to.
The games come first on that count.
By keeping it fun the szine has a much better chance of lasting longer.
This time the last issue was only four weeks ago.
So what's your problem?
Too many issues??
Tough, you take what I give you!!!
<b>[[TAP and the Boob Report used to go out separately with 
sometimes different schedules in an attempt to keep the games on track
always, much as Brad Wilson did in more recent years, with issue 100
I stopped that.]]</b>))</i>
But I did want to write anyway, because my interaction with the hobby 
has, of necessity, plummeted lately to a mere trickle of letters, along
with (of course) <i>High Inertia</i> and our two games on flyer.
I do want to keep my hand in....
<i>((Well, well, welcome to the NMRing world of the big-time pubber.
I didn't know you were running two games on flyer.
Are they the games that used to appear in <b>Rebel</b> with <b>High Inertia</b>?
Does that mean that all that wonderful press is ignored by the general public?
Oh, woe is us...))</i>

<p>
 Anyway, on to what I wanted to write about: <i>The Cream Shall
Rise!</i> is out, and I have just finished poring over it at lunch (and for
a few hours afterward - the bloody encyclopedia is 88 PAGES LONG!).
One of Brux's comments in it struck me particularly, because it links
right in to a point I had planned to pontificate on in <i>HI</i>
sometime, but somehow I kept forgetting about it.
Bruce's comment: ``Too many of the top zines are not as timely as they
could be."
(He made this comment in the context of several areas which could still
stand improvement in the hobby.)
<i>((Absolutely, I agree.
At this point, as I always try to do when the writer has serious points
to make, I will bow out until the end.
I hope that with Linda's letter and my editorial last issue we can get some
alternative discussion going here, but please don't forget the music focus
of the szine!
If you forget, be assured that I won't, now back to Linda...))</i>

<p>
 I have been thinking about this for quite a while, since a number
of zines that Steve and I sub to have been notably absent from our
mailboxes for long stretches lately.
Some have come bouncing back; some have faded into the Twilight Zone.
But most of the zines with timeliness problems, it seems to me, have a 
similar problem:

<p>
 THEY'RE TOO #$% of &amp;*! GOOD!!!
<i>((<b>[[I wish we had that problem today.]]</b>))</i>

<p>
 This may sound like a dumb criticism to make, but I really do
think it is valid if a pubber has to take long unexpected breaks between
issues.
(The word ``unexpected" is key here.
I don't care if someone only comes out four, three, two, one times a year
- as long as he/she ANNOUNCES that as a pubbing schedule!
Otherwise, the poor reader has to start asking around, ``Say, have you
heard anything from....?
Did my issue get lost in the mail, or...?"
I think most of us have been through this at one time or another.)
What I am trying to say is that each pubber should KNOW HIS/HER LIMITS.
Otherwise, he or she is eventually going to find him/herself wading in
some pretty deep hobby guacamole, with a stack of unanswered letters and
unadjudicated games, a disgruntled readership who is losing interest in
the games and is waiting for its money back, a load of guilt the size of
Texas for not being on time, and an intensity of pressure which is bound
to spill over into how that pubber conducts other parts of his/her life.
For a pubber who got into the hobby for fun, none of it is going to seem
that much fun anymore.
And yet, the problem could have been avoided so easily.

<p>
 The majority of zines I know which are running late seem to have
gotten too big and ambitious for their pubbers' schedules and/or wallets.
Some were born that way.
And that's what I mean when I say pubbers should know their limits.
To explain this, let me postulate ``The Pubber's Ten Commandments":

<p>
 1. START SMALL. 
I have been staggered by the size and complexity of a number of recent zines
starting out - the number of pages, the professional production, the
number of gamestarts offered, the length and scope of discussion forums.
As a reader, of course, that kind of zine thrills (and sometimes even 
overwhelms) me.
As a pubber, I know the enormous number of hours which must be poured into
an effort like that and how easily it can lead to burnout.
Any new pubber should ease into that kind of commitment, rather than
diving in headfirst!
One or two gamestarts, a few pages of discussion,
simple production techniques should be advised for a novice pubber.
After he/she has tested the waters and knows whether he <i>((shouldn't
that be ``he/she"?
I prefer inclusive language to these awkward slashes.
It's an important issue, but the result has to make sense in spoken
English or it won't work.
I prefer to adjust syntax to the plural (e.g. they) as an alternative to
he/she.                                                      
Besides, he/she always puts the male first.
But I did say I wasn't going to interrupt...fooled you again))</i>
can afford the time, energy, and money loss, the zine can be made a bit
more elaborate.
But the new pubber should take his/her zine one step at a time, and
stop expanding the minute any part of the investment becomes more
than he/she can comfortably handle.

<p>
 2. PLAN AHEAD.
I recall a hobby pubber who thought it was enough to plan six months
in advance in considering pubbing and game starts.
I do not agree.
As anyone who plays knows, an average Dip game, run on a regular
schedule, lasts two or three years of real time.
Every time a pubber starts a game, he/she should be conscious
of this and take into account what life-changes to expect in that time.
Of course, some changes are unpredictable, but a careful pubber should
plan to leave as few orphans as is physically possible, assuming he/she
finds his/her life takes such an extreme twist that continued adjudications
are impossible.

<p>
 3. DON'T WIMP OUT.
Don't ever let anyone talk you into more gamestarts than you can handle,
a more elaborate zine than you can afford, becoming a zine if you don't
feel the time is right, or having more subbers than you think you can
hack pubbing for.

<p>
 4. SWITCH GEARS.
If life gets very busy, don't be afraid to set up a new pubbing schedule
you can handle.
Just because you've always come out every month doesn't mean you have to
keep doing it.
State your new schedule clearly -then keep to it.
I think readers prefer knowing where they stand to expecting a monthly
issue that doesn't come for six months.

<p>
 5. CONSIDER FAMILY. 
Any time a pubber is deciding whether to start or expand a zine, he/she
must keep in mind the amount of time it will take away from family time.
It is the rare Dipster with a husband or wife or significant other in
the hobby, and even those relationships must find ``quality time" to
survive and thrive - ALL relationships must.
No Dipzine is worth breaking up over!
So plan your pubbing schedule accordingly, and don't take hobby frustrations
out on family members (I have done this; it's easy to get TOO serious
about pubbing).

<p>
 6. HAVE FUN!
If a pubber begins to see the zine as a chore rather than as an 
enjoyable venture (on a regular basis, I mean; all pubbers consider it a
drag at certain times!), it is definitely time for that pubber to begin
looking at his/her zine to see if he/she is overextending.

<p>
 7. BE HONEST.
Admit to yourself an area of pubbing you are worried about, and then
you will be able to plan a solution.
Too many games? 
Begin to consider a guest GM or the Orphan Service.
Too many pages?
Think about whittling away at the size of the ``feature" section
of the zine.
Too much money spent?
Consider raising your sub fees, cutting trades, initiating or raising
game fees, establishing a cutoff point for your sub list.
Too disorganized?
Get your sub system in order.

<p>
 8. SEE THE BIG PICTURE.
Pubbing is probably only one of your hobby activities.
To start or expand a zine, something else on your schedule will probably
have to go.
It might be taking on fewer or no new games, subbing to fewer zines, 
refusing or finding someone new for a hobby service, or voting for draws
in some games you are in.
The solution to your pubbing problem might be outside your pubbing.

<p>
 9. REMEMBER REAL LIFE.
Don't let your pubbing career get so big that you find yourself turning
down get-togethers with friends or relatives, neglecting your job or
abusing its privileges (Xerox, coffee breaks, telephones) in order
to work on your zine or games, planning vacations or household needs
around your pubbing schedule.

<p>
 10. FOLD CLEANLY.
When the time comes to close down shop, make it a good break for you and
your readers by taking it on yourself to rehouse your games (if at all
possible), return sub fees quickly and voluntarily, notify all subbers and
traders of your decision as soon as you can make it and then follow through
with arrangements in what the business world calls ``a timely fashion".
Then get back to your post-pubbing life knowing you have left publishing
in good standing, and you can go back to enjoying being a ``civilian"!

<p>
 Anyway, Jim-Boob, I appreciate your providing me with the forum
for gettiing all this off my chest.
I hope all this helps someone, and congrats on your own zine, which is always
fascinating to read and very well-produced.

 <i>((Thank you, Linda, for a thought provoking letter.
I appreciate the comments about my szine as well.
I agree with Linda in questioning the service to the hobby that
is done when pubbers start up big, popular szines only to
have them fold when the pubbers get in over their heads.
Unfortunately, there is ego involved and ego drives many
pubbers to get into publishing at all. 
Periodically, I have to resist the temptation to try to do a
``big szine".
Forcing myself to do two small szines in my way of dealing with that 
problem, but all pubbers should be willing to face it in some way.
Most of the rest of what Linda said mirrors countless letters I wrote
to pubbers as Orphan Service custodian.
I guess my best public statement of those thoughts was my article
that appears on the back page of Bruce Linsey's <b>Once Upon a
Deadline</b>, the pubbers handbook.
My feeling about that project, despite its laudable, impressive
completeness, is that it makes me feel too many of those destructive
``bigness" urges.
Speaking of Bruce, 
I have the letter up next that those of you who have been 
around for awhile were expecting after last issue's editorial.
Let me emphasize that there will be no feuding in this szine.
PERIOD.
However, as a former hobby custodian, I have considered carefully the
purpose of hobby projects.
Let me share with you my primary conclusion.
Hobby projects must be conducted in a completely positive way, with
positive results, to the greatest extent possible.
Unintended harm and hurt are always possible, but the institutional
conduct of the project must be channeled in positive directions.
For example, in the Orphan Service, my former project, I never assessed
blame, never levied blind threats, never treated any individual in a
way that I would not want to be treated, but only tried to help resolve
problems.
In general, all of the custodians of the Orphan Service in my memory
have operated in that manner, but think about the implications if the
Orphan Service were not operated benevolently....))</i>

<p>
Jim,
Diplomacy rem embrances are numerous, but I knew her best as a GM/Pubber and 
fellow inaugural BB Leaguer. The highest praise I know to give is that her 
'zine <i>KK</i> was always timely, fairly adjudicated and had a tremendous player's 
list with minimal NMRs and I don't remember her missing the playoffs!

<p>
My fondest memory is picking her up at the airport in KC in the late 80s or 
early 90s for a Poolcon and taking her back to ``The Farm" on the Kansas 
Plains. (It was a running joke with Kathy because invariably new Dip players 
would send you the ``Hi, I'm 35, have 2 kids and a dog..." letter and for a 
while my response was, to say the least, a ``fabrication" about a crazy old 
farmer. Someone mentioned it to her and she got quite a hoot out of it.) 
Having never met Kathy and only "knowing" her through games/letters/calls I 
expected to meet a cross between Maria from West Side Story and Wonder Woman. 
She purposely didn't fill me in and said she'd pick me out. As I dutifully 
waited as people disembarked waiting for some eye contact/recognition, 
eventually I noticed someone standing next to me...of course, I knew then it 
was Kathy...I never felt the blade until I sat down in the car!

<p>
She was the consummate competitor and I was privileged to call her a friend. 
I will miss her...

<i>((Jim-Boob?
No kidding!
One question I was going to ask Daf and Gary about one of my
remembrances.  I remember that Kathy went to one of the Pudgecon's at
Bob Olsen's house, I thought it was the same one that Daf came to where
Gary, Daf and I (and others) got in that huge water fight where we
flooded out Bob's basement with Russ Rusnak
(one of the places I got my nickname for Bob Olsen
of Sludge!).  But perhaps that was a different 
Pudgecon.  I know Kathy and Gary were together at the same one, weren't
they??))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Daf Langley (Thu, 22 Aug 2002 10:05:54 -0700)</b>

<p>
I've been thinking about this for a few days now.  Even though Kathy 
and I hadn't talked in years, she was still someone who I counted as a
friend.  As I heard the news from Don, I must admit that, while the 
news hurt very much, I couldn't bring up a picture of Kathy's face.  I
had met her a few times.  Once at her place in New York and once when 
she came out to stay with Steve and I in California.

<p>
She could definitely light up a room.  But, speaking as another 
diva who appreciates being the center of attention (I know, hard to 
believe!), she never made you feel like you were being upstaged. 

<p>
In the last few days, I've been reliving that time in my life. 
Remembering old friends who I hadn't thought of in years.  And there, 
amidst the memories, was her face.  Luckily it was a sunny day and I 
had on my sunglasses - so no one could see the sudden tears in my eyes. 

<p>
I know everyone has a Kathy story.  It's a part of who she was.  
I just wanted to let you all know that I have found her face in my 
memory. Possibly months, years too late, but it is there.  And with 
that face are the memories of a golden time.  And to let you know that
I care for each and every one of you.  It's big hug time and this is 
mine to you.

<p>
I remember well the PudgeCon where we flooded his <i>((Bob Olsen's))</i>
basement with our waterfight - which, I seem to remember - started with 
squirtguns and progressed to kettles of water being thrown about.  
What was the name of the guy from Ohio - or was it Iowa - who was in the 
middle of that with us?  
<i>((Well, Russ Rusnak was, you doused him with QUITE a kettle of water,
but Jim Williams was the one from Iowa.))</i>
Were Gary and Kathy at that one?  
Gary might have been, but I don't remember Kathy. 
She was at the one previously that Steve had gone to before I ``shacked" up with him! 
<i>((Correct, see below for details....))</i>

<p>
I hope John will quit worrying about us and take care of himself. 
I can't imagine what he's feeling right now.  
I've got his phone number, so I think I'll call him in a week or two.

<p>
I've been thinking about Michalski lately.  I'd love to get back in touch with him. 
<i>((I have Michalski's postal address, but not his E-Mail address. 
I expect we'll get some reaction from John after he reads all of this.))</i>
Is Dave Grabar still around?  He should be told if he hasn't already.  
<i>((Grabar is in John's baseball league and John is making us talk
about our playoff runs to get his mind off things.  Grabar's team
stinks, but I'm fighting Dicko (Martin) and Behnen for the playoffs.
You wouldn't believe how life in the Caruso household in the last
8-10 years has revolved around that baseball league.  Kathy's Mets
team won the last World Series for the first time in awhile 
and just surged into First Place in
the NL East this last turn that John ran just before the funeral.
We all told him not to, but he did.))</i> 

<p>
I saw in an email somewhere that someone told Steve for which I am grateful.  
The old Madison bunch?  Rusnak, Petersen, Ozog?  Ron CA Brown?  Larry Peery?  
The man/woman from Enid, Oklahoma (I'm having a hard time coming up with his name!).  
<i>((Oh yes, Frauke Petersen and Scott Hanson.  They are still married and
living in Germany.  They have a little baby whose pictures were on
their website the last I looked (I'll have to look it up).  No one
has told them, I believe, but I'll alert them about this issue.
I've heard NOTHING from Ron CA Brown for
a very long time.  He must be in a deep depression that the Rams
moved to St. Louis and THEN got good.  He was a massive Rams fan.
I hope you don't mind if I print some of this for everyone to see.))</i>

<p>
I appreciate your asking.  It is a grim task.  
But I must say, I've had such a wonderful bitter sweet time 
remembering those old days.  
It's terrible that it takes someone's death to send me back there.

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Gary Coughlan (Fri, 23 Aug 2002 19:48:47 -0500)</b>

<p>
I too would like to say something about Kathy.  I dug up some 
articles about her for Jim-Bob to print in <i>TAP</i> if he wishes but I 
mainly wanted to find those articles (they were in my hot, dusty 
attic in my zine 
collection) for me so I recall the good times I had with her.  I'd like 
to share my earliest encounter with Kathy........

<p>
I entered the hobby in late 1979 and among the many zines
that I subscribed to was <i>Ter-ran</i> published by Steve Heinowski out of
Ohio.  He welcomed me into what I soon learned during 1980 was a 
zine of many good friends who loved to poke fun at each other, who 
played in several games together, who waged press wars and taunted 
and good-naturedly teased each other in the letter column and 
submitted articles on all kinds of topics.  It was in this zine that
I first encountered Faz, John Caruso and Kathy Byrne (as she was 
known before she married John).

<p>
In 1980, I was a complete novice, everyone has to start 
somewhere, and one of my first games was in <i>Ter-ran</i> where I was very 
much the new kid on the block placed in Italy right next to a  
larger-than-life-even-then Mark ``Faz" Fassio--shades of ``Odyssey" 21
years later.  Not only that, but this game, Steve said, was going to
be a ``Bourse" Diplomacy game where the readers of the entire zine 
could participate and ``buy stock" in the countries that they thought
would do well.

<p>
When Spring 1901 results were revealed, it was obvious that 
my Italy was at the bottom of the heap among the Bourse players, of 
whom Kathy was one.  As it turned out, I did what I always would do 
in Diplomacy games, and ``pestered" my friends and enemies with 
letters.  I also ``attacked" the Bourse players in my press who had 
failed to ``invest" in my Italy and ``reward" those who had bought 
Italian stock with Italian art treasures like ``David", the ``Pieta", etc.

<p>
I got a letter from the Kathy Byrne herself and trembling 
and shaking I opened it up.  What could this world-famous female Dip
player be writing lowly me for?  Like everyone else in <i>Ter-ran</i>, and 
in zines across North America, I avidly read Kathy and about 
Kathy-she generated a lot of press, articles and comments.  In 
this letter, she told me that she and John Caruso would be calling 
me on the telephone the next Saturday and told me the time.  I was
stunned and very nervous.

<p>
Saturday came and I answered with my deep Southern accent to
a raspy, wise-cracking Brooklyn brogue-Kathy.  ``I love your 
accent" she cooed to me and I was overwhelmed with her friendliness.

<p>
Among other things, she told me she was going to be buying lots of 
Italian stock in the Bourse from now on because, and I'll never 
forget these words, ``your letters make an impact on people".  I felt
I had been knighted by a Queen and I guess I had been.

<p>
I went on to do very well in this <i>Ter-ran</i> game, and make my 
Bourse backers a lot of money, and I owe a lot of it to Kathy's 
encouragement of me at a time when I was feeling left out of the ``in
crowd".  In this same game, Kathy also showed her great competitive 
spirit when John Caruso came in as the Russian standby.  ``This is 
going to ruin all my Bourse plans.  I don't know why Steve put John 
in this game!" Kathy bemoaned.  This is the Kathy that I want to 
remember.  Always.

<p>
I found another Kathy story that may be of interest to y'all since she 
instigated it and it truly shows her sense of humor at its best and how 
she loved flouting authority..  It's from the Thanksgiving ByrneCon, 
November 24-27, 1983 that Bob Olsen, Mike Mazzer, Mike Mills, Tom
Swider, Robert Sacks, Woody and I, among many others, attended and we 
were all in this game with Kathy.  Here is the con report I wrote. I'm 
so glad I wrote reports because almost all of this stuff I have 
forgotten after nearly 20 years....

<p>
``Back to ByrneCon [after eating out at a steakhouse], where we 
decided to play a gunboat game on Kathy's Dutch Dip set that Woody had 
bought for her in Europe.  Robert Sacks was the GM so we decided to play 
with his mind.  We used the Dutch abbreviations (by checking in the rule 
book) for army, fleet and the provinces, as well as for hold, support 
and convoy and build and remove.

<p>
So ``A Swe" became ``L Zwe" and ``F Bla"  became ``V Zwa".  When 
we got tired of that, we switched countries.  I was Russia, Italy and 
Germany in this game at various times.  Then we started adding extra 
units to the board, called in English ``Flying Dutchman" and that's where 
Sacks finally caught on-when he read the orders, not because of seeing 
us add units right under his eyes.  He picked up the board and dumped 
it!

<p>
We went for an ombudsman as Sacks tightly held the orders, the 
``evidence".  Carl Russell and then Bruce Linsey were our ombudsmen and 
Sacks said that it appeared several players in the game had been (gasp!) 
``cheating", but he wanted to apologize to the English and German players 
because it seemed they hadn't. (This was Mills and Swider, the two worst 
offenders of all!).

<p>
Now I'm not sure if it was Saturday or Sunday, because I didn't 
see it, although I certainly heard about it, but Woody had been 
badgering Sacks about the gunboat game and other things.  Eyewitnesses 
say that when Woody gave Sacks his choice of being called ``Bob", ``Bobby" 
or ``Robbie" and started using ``Bobby" instead of the ``Robert" that Sacks 
prefers, Sacks went after him with a beer bottle.  No one believed this 
who saw it.  Anyway, I understand that Sacks requested that Woody not be 
invited to the New Year's ByrneCon, and Woody says he intends to go and 
aggravate him even more then.

<p>
This was the day that the cokes and other drinks ran out and 
Robert Sacks was thirsty. Kathy told him to drink some of the Amaretto and
Cognac, telling him it was like Kool-Aid.  And he did!"

<p>
Here is what I found about the PudgeCons, along with some tidbits:

<p>
(1)  These cons were not called by this name at first, at least the 
first one wasn't.  It was referred to as ``ToadyCon" and ``WichitaCon".  
By the time the second one came around they were referred to as 
PudgeCons.

<p>
(2) The first PudgeCon was held September 10-12, 1982--almost 20 
years ago, can you believe it?  21, including Bob Olsen were there.  
Before this time, Bob had only met of us and that one was....Mike 
Mazzer!

<p>
(3)  The 21 at the first PudgeCon in alphabetical order:  Steve ``Woody" 
Arnawoodian, Jim Burgess, Kathy Byrne, Gary Coughlan, Randy Ellis, Al 
Giddings, Scott Hanson, Stuart Lancaster, Steve Langley, Mark Luedi, 
Mike Mazzer, John Michalski, Bob Olsen, Bob Osuch, Eric Ozog, Al 
Pearson, Marc Peters, Dave Pilant, Paul Rauterberg, Keith Sherwood and 
Bill Yeaton.
<i>((And I came up by bus from Dallas across Oklahoma, that year
where I got the ``Jim-Bob'' nickname.
Everyone carried <b>Europa Express</b>'s as badges of identification
in the airports and bus stations.... but I didn't come as far by
bus as ONE memorable attendee...))</i>

<p>
(4)  Kathy and the lst PudgeCon:  ``Kathy and Woody flew to Pittsburgh 
where they met Al Pearson and all three of them flew to Kansas City 
where they met Scott Hanson, rented a car and drove 4 hours to reach 
Wichita."  Maybe Woody or Scott could talk about what must have been a 
memorable car ride.

<p>
(5) Woody and Bob Olsen met me (Gary) at the airport and ``they said that 
Michalski and Byrne had finally met each other.  Toots and Luscious 
together at last."

<p>
(6) Steve Langley had traveled by bus for 14 hours from California to 
reach Wichita.  Kathy, at this con, told us she had called Steve Langley 
on the telephone a few weeks previously, never having talked to him 
before and:  ``pretended that she had gotten his name from a dating 
service called ``Love Mates".  Steve was puzzled on the phone and said 
she must have made a mistake.  She said ``Aren't you Steve Langley, don't 
you have two daughters?"  When Steve said, ``Yes, but..."  Kathy said, 
``Look, I paid $50.00 to get you name from ``Love Mates" so when are we 
going to go out?!"  She finally told him who she was.''

<p>
(7) Another quote from my review of this first PudgeCon:  ``John Caruso, 
who couldn't go to Wichita, had sent a postcard to Bob Olsen telling him 
to watch over Kathy and keep her away from Michalski or else.  I believe 
the phrase was ``If he lays one hand or anything else on her, I'm coming 
after ya."  The picture I took for Kathy's ``snapshot collection" with 
her in Michalski's lap with his tongue wagging around, speaks for 
itself!"

<p>
(8) I had carried a big army duffel bag full of squirt guns.  Michalski 
got the Magnum, Kathy had one called the ``Spunkler" and I had a ``Lugar". 
 We would do refills at the kitchen faucet.

<p>
(9) I had forgotten that Daf was the hobby's designated ``official 
UnknownCon Call Girl" and she got a call from this first PudgeCon:  
``John Michalski called Daphne and we all talked to her.  I'm sure she 
was glad to have been called in the daytime rather than at night for a 
change, right, Russ?"  [This must be referring to Rusnak]

<p>
While looking for this stuff, I found an article Daf had 
written for my zine about the calls she would get and I'd like to put 
that in here too:  Daf says:  ``There is another aspect to the ordinary 
phone call.  It is the infamous Gang Call.  Imagine if you will, laying 
in bed at 3 in the morning and having your sleep shattered by a ringing 
telephone.  You pick it up, expecting heavy breathing, and discover it 
is a bunch of drunken Dip maniacs calling from Illinois.  Call me a 
masochist, but I loved it! I heard a blow by blow description of the 
game in progress, I talked to a lot of delightful people and when they 
all finally passed out and hung up, I saw a beautiful sunrise to boot.  
Actually, instead of being mad, I'm flattered to be the official 
UnknownCon Call Girl.  Gee, maybe, I should rephrase that.

<p>
(10) Comments were made on various sleeping people:  ``observing how 
innocent Langley looked when he slept and how conscienceless Mazzer 
looked when he was asleep"

<p>
Then Pudgecon II, when they were referred to as PudgeCons, was August 
12-15, 1983.  Eighteen showed up at this one:
(1) In attendance: alphabetically:  Peter Ashley, Mike Barno, Jim 
Burgess, Gary Coughlan, Jeff Ellis, Randy Ellis, Daf, Scott Hanson, 
Steve Langley, Mike Mazzer, John Michalski, Bob Olsen, Eric Ozog, Marc 
Peters, Frauke Petersen, Russ Rusnak, Carl Russell and Jim Williams.
<i>((This time I flew to Chicago and drove to Wichita on the Ozog
lovemobile road trip.
I think we had Barno, Ozog, Peters, Russ Rusnak, and Carl Russell on board?))</i>

<p>
(2)  This con received phone calls from James Woodson, Tom Swider, Woody 
and........Don Williams

<p>
(3)   This is the one where Daf masqueraded as a Hare Krishna at the 
airport when they came to pick us up.  We had never seen Daf up to this 
point.  An excerpt:  ``a Hare Krishna woman started bugging me to make a 
donation.  I had dealt with these people while in the Army at airports 
in Los Angeles and San Francisco but Wichita?!  She kept pace with me 
telling me that hers was an international organization and would I like 
to read their material?  How about a contribution of 71 cents?  Wouldn't 
I just look at the material.  No, no, no!  Then the woman said, ``Gary!"  
It was then that I met Daf and got the gag.  She was carrying the Voice 
of Doom houserules (infamous for their length which cost 71 cents to 
mail).
The odd figure for a donation didn't even dawn on me as I just 
wanted to be rid of this pest!  Later that night, they would play the 
same trick on Mike Mazzer who also fell for it until he heard the 71 
cents."

<p>
(4)   The water pistol at this fight surpassed the level of the first 
one:  ``Friday night was the first of two massive water gun fights 
complete with hot water in the guns and glasses of water poured over 
heads....Daf found out how a squirt gun fight could degenerate into a 
``wet t-shirt contest"....The second water fight was on Saturday night.  
Out of 21 water pistols, only 7 still operated after it was all over.  I 
don't mean some minor misfunction--I mean they were broken."

<p>
(5)  At the very end, Daf, Steve and I were left at Bob's and this 
incident happened:  ``Before leaving, Bob had a saleslady come to his 
door inquiring about his children.  He told her he didn't have any.  She 
asked him to tell her if any of his neighbors had children.  Just when 
he finished telling her this, I said in small voice (I was out of sight 
from the door), ``Who's at the door, Daddy?"  Bob's stunned look was 
priceless as we all knew the saleslady had heard me.  He hastily shut 
the door and said:  ``Go to your room!"

<p>
I know all of this wasn't strictly about Kathy but I feel we need some 
``remembered happiness" and she was a big part of it.  I don't recall if 
there were any PudgeCons after this........I didn't go if there 
were.....and since I have to soon leave for work today, I haven't had 
time to scan the <i>EE</i>s beyond this.

<i>((Wow, what memories... my all time favorite memories of the first
PudgeCon were about the gaming, and those of the second one were about
the water fights!
The first Pudgecon featured a game with me as Russia and Kathy as
Germany (I think that's what it was) where I ruthlessly stabbed and
attacked her until she finally screamed at me.... ``You Boob, I'll
crush you like a worm.''
And then she did!
I never could play Russia...
and at one point Eric Ozog and I spent an entire negotiation turn 
alternating between giggling and laughing hysterically on Bob's front
lawn about some insanely funny move that had just happened.
What fun!!))</i>

<p>
Funny, cuz I was at Pudgecon I and had visited Bob in Wichita before that...
rode with Paul Rauterberg and I think it was Ozog and Marc Peters or Mark
Luedi in the other car. And we did call it Pudgecon, but not until we started
writing it up afterwards. Paul had a convertible and it was hotter than hell
on the drive down. I think we made it in about nine hours. So we get in the
door at Olsen's and I sit down, exhausted, and Byrne jumps on my lap and asks
``Are you good in bed?" I was too shocked to answer but I had finally met
Kathy. We had a great time, though,as opposed to other Cons, I pretty much
kept out of the limelight. I do remember going out to dinner with Toots and
Kathy and others. And the squirt guns, of course, and talking with Sherwood
about something psychedelic. And I did get credit for my comment on a girl we
saw while out ... ``looks like 30 miles of bad road", which Luedi later would
name his zeen.

Hi Jim;

<p>
I first got to know Kathy through <i>Feuilletonist's Forum</i> (I know that I
misspelled that!).
<i>((No, you didn't.... well, truthfully, I fixed it....))</i> 
It was my first PBM game and Kathy was the first to write
to me.  She always signed her letters ``Grandma", even though she wasn't much
older than I.  She was Italy (of course) and I was England.  We got going in
the game, but the zine folded and the game was never successfully orphaned.

<p>
Nevertheless, we ended up in many games together, and became friends.  Gary
Behnen and I went to a few Cons together, and one of them was the last
PudgeCon in Wichita, Kansas.  It was shortly after that, that Gary and I
decided to host a few Cons at my place.  They were called PoolCon.  We have
had many hobby notables attend, including some of the CADs; Michael Lowrey
and Dan Sellers among them.  Anyway, Kathy showed at the 2nd one, maybe
1990, I don't recall exactly.

<p>
Kathy was a character, and more full of life and humor than any other two
people.  She was not afraid of anything, or anybody and had a great fount of
love in her.  She was the highlight of the Con.

<p>
A few years later, I mostly dropped out of Dip, but have stayed active in
other games, with some overlap into the hobby.  I have been receiving <i>TAP</i>
for years (Thank you!), and this has allowed me to keep up with the hobby.
Anyway, I noticed Kathy's name here and there as she'd pillage newbies and
old timers alike.

<p>
To say that she was a character would be trite, and an understatement, but
it happens to be true.  I've never met John, but she wrote so much about
him, and talked so much about him, that I feel as if I know him.  I know
life is tough for him right now and he has my prayers and good will.  Hang
in there John, or else Kathy will kick your butt.

<p>
I'll miss my friend Kathy Caruso, but never forget her.

And, speaking of Kathy as a ``character'' let's go with this one next:))</i>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>Steve Emmert (Sat, 24 Aug 2002 19:45:00 -0400)</b>

<p>
Jim, recently I got the following note from Suzanne Castagne, an incredibly
talented player living near Paris:

<p>
<b>From: ``Suzanne Castagne"  &lt; sucastag of wanadoo.fr &gt; </b>:
Who was Kathy Caruso? Was there really a woman who was one of the best
diplomacy players ? What sort of a ``character" was she?

<p>
I hope she won't mind my answering her publicly, as it were.  Yes, Suzanne,
the best player in the world was, for a time, a woman.  Kathy was legendary,
a masterful tactician and superior communicator who added a rapier wit to
her formidable diplomatic talents.  I am poorly equipped to write about her
role in the hobby, but I'll try here.

<p>
I joined the postal Dip hobby in the mid- to late 80's, so I came in after
the brightest period of Kathy's play.  But that didn't stop her from giving
me a nickname, something she did for all the people she liked, according to
Don Williams.  Mine was ``Mooseman," a reference to my affinity for the
cartoon character Bullwinkle.  I got to meet Kathy once, at her home in
Brooklyn, where my wife and I were invited one Saturday afternoon.  We
didn't play Diplomacy, but I enjoyed the chance to simply be with someone
who was esteemed with the very best of players, and an ebullient personality
as well.

<p>
I can't tell you the secret of Kathy's ability, though I have heard from
others small snippets of her tactics:  The last-minute phone call, just
before the deadline, designed to make you uneasy with your ally, just enough
to get you to change your orders in a way she could exploit.  The aggressive
play from positions where one would expect passivity, or at least patience.
(The Byrne Opening, which in my opinion is the best opening for Italy, is
named for her.)  The attack press, a technique all but unknown to PBEM
players, but the very soul of PBM play.  (Similarly, she inspired the title,
``Byrnesse Abuse" for needling but good-natured attacks on a player.)

<p>
I got to play against Kathy once, in what turned out to be her last game.
It was an invitational game, and Kathy had to be coaxed out of retirement by
Don.  As it turned out, she really didn't have the time to devote to the
game, and she wound up getting eliminated early.  So I didn't see her game
at her best.  But others did.  Recently, when I ran the game My Melon,
Callie Baby, I invited the Academy to vote for the best player you'd ever
faced.  I voted in my own poll, and I voted for Mark Fassio, who won Kathy's
last game.  And he has written to me recently to say (I hope he doesn't mind
my quoting him here) that he has respected the play of a great many players,
but he feared only one, and that was you-know-who.  If the best player I've
ever faced tells me that Kathy was the only player who scared him, that
really tells you something.

<p>
Kathy married John Caruso, a very capable Dip player in his own right.  John
was a terror on the board if you attacked him, but I never got to see that;
I only saw the man who went far out of his way to accommodate a man (and his
opera singer wife) who he'd never met, simply because his wife asked him to
do so.  It was apparent to me that John loved Kathy deeply, despite the
absence of outward displays of emotion toward each other.  They LIKED each
other, and that's the basis of a successful marriage; I have made sure it's
the foundation of my own.

<p>
Kathy was abrasive, outrageously funny, and tactically brilliant.  She had
an unfettered abilty to laugh, and would dare to laugh AT you.  If you were
shortsighted, you might take offense at first.  But then you'd realize that
she was right, and you'd start to laugh at yourself.  The ability to do that
is priceless.

<p>
Whenever I get together with my Dip friends, I have always offered a toast
to the man who has given me such happiness and so many wonderful friends:
``To Allan Calhamer."    Now I have another name to add to that toast.

<p>
Yes, Suzanne.  She was really the best.

<br /><br /><b>Gary Coughlan (Sat, 17 Aug 2002 18:32:53 -0500)</b>

<p>
Hi Jim-Bob,
I decided to go ahead and type the two articles up. 
They wiped away some of my sadness and brought back some wonderful 
memories and I hope they do the same for you.  Let me know what you 
think..........Gary

<p>
These are two articles about Kathy Byrne Caruso and one is by her with 
her own chosen title.  Both are from the pre-email early 1980s when the 
Diplomacy hobby was almost totally postal and, just as now, females were 
a rarity. All of Kathy's voluminous correspondence was hand-written in a 
beautifully seductive, very feminine flowing script, full of loops and 
curves.  

<p>
<i>((And you can find Kathy's famous article on playing Italy, still
the best one ever written on the subject, on Stephen Agar's 
www.diplomacy-archive.com web site.
These are JUST perfect!!))</i>

<p>
The first article  appeared in Steve Heinowski's dipzine 
<i>Ter-ran</i> #37 in which Kathy describes first coming to the hobby and 
meeting her eventual husband, John Caruso who she describes in this 
article as ``a true dippy addict".  In Kathy's own words.......

<p>
<br /><br />
<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b>PLAYER PROFILE:  Is She For Real?  --by Kathy Byrne</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Since I can't stand reading Blind Pan anymore [Pubber Steve's 
monthly column in <i>Ter-ran</i>], I am going to attempt to fill up Steve's 
empty space with a player profile on none other than that die-hard   
*&amp;#$#  from New York.  Contrary to popular belief, I am not a creature 
from outer space sent here to infiltrate the male Diplomacy world.  
<i>((That was Ieapo Stabo!))</i>
I am a normal (semi-normal, would you believe, crazy?) 30 year old (whose 
grey hair is multiplying with every stab) bookkeeper with 3 children 
including a set of twins.

<p>
Two years ago I started dating a true dippy addict.  Finally 
I couldn't stand it anymore (if you can't beat'em, join'em), so I signed 
up for a game in <i>Ter-ran</i> (Steve, were you lucky-of all the zines I was 
getting, I liked yours best-just think you almost lost me to Jerry 
Jones!).

<p>
The odds in Diplomacy are amazing:  it's a 100,000 to 1 shot 
that there will be another female in the game, but it's a 1,000,000 to 1 
shot that out of the other 6 guys, one will side with me.  One such 
player wrote, ``You belong in the kitchen", but I had no idea what his 
gripe was as I always write my moves and letters in the kitchen.

<p>
My first year in Diplomacy is almost completed (I'd be rich 
if I had a quarter from everyone who said I wouldn't make it); but 4 
months ago I was ready to hang it up.  Steve convinced me to stick it 
out for a while longer (boy, is he a glutton for punishment).  He really 
believed that the players would get used to me.  Well, I'm glad now that 
I listened to him.  Last game start, I was considered to be a ``normal" 
player, allies were not so hard to find and people were even listening 
to my strategies.  So, there's hope for the female wargamer yet, and I 
expect to beg and plead for a long time (this time any bet gladly 
accepted-I know I'll be around a year from now, the worst is over!)

<p>
Na-no, Na-no Earthlings

<p>
PS  Any wife, girlfriend, etc. considering joining the world of Dip, get 
in touch with me.  I will be happy to pass along some tips and words of 
encouragement.

<p>
<br />The second article was about Kathy and it appeared in <i>EUROPA EXPRESS</i>
#12 (March 4, 1982), a theme issue devoted to women players in the 
Diplomacy hobby from all over the world.

<p>
<br /><br />
<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b>ALL ABOUT KATHY --by Gary Coughlan</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
``There never was, and there never will be, another like you." 
(from the motion picture All About Eve (1950), George Sanders to Anne 
Baxter).  These words are also descriptive of New Yorker Kathy Byrne, 
one of the best players that Diplomacy has ever seen--male or female.

<p>
And Kathy is definitely female.  As she wrote to me in her 
beautiful feminine handwriting: ``I mean who else but me can finish Round 
One at [ORIGINS convention] with at least fifty guys watching while I 
give my two allies a kiss!"  Who else indeed!

<p>
And Kathy is definitely an excellent player.  She won fourth 
place, out of 120, at last year's GenCon East.  She recently won the 
hobby-wide <i>Whitestonia</i> Best Players Poll.  She is currently the only 
player, ever in the history of the hobby, male or female, to have three 
postal wins as Italy.  She also has a postal win as Russia.

<p>
With such tremendous achievements, combined with the fact 
that she is a female, Kathy is probably the most well-known hobby member 
today.  Virtually everyone has at least heard her name even if they know 
nothing else about her.

<p>
Kathy's high visibility also stems from the many games she 
enters in many zines.  By all accounts, she is a very active negotiator 
in her games.  As one anonymous writer told me: ``She has tremendous 
persuasive powers, much of which stems from the fact that she's 
female...You have to give her credit; before she's done she'll have 
amassed one of the more impressive records in Dip history.  And she is a 
good tactical player."

<p>
And she is also a good writer, winning second place in the 
recent <i>Whitestonia</i> Best Writers Poll.  Kathy does two subzines: 
<i>Kathy's Kornor</i> in <i>Whitestonia</i> and <i>Kathy's Kode</i> in 
<i>Coat of Arms</i>.  
She has also 
written articles and letters in scores of zines on a wide variety of 
subjects.  And she rarely, if ever, fails to submit press in her many 
games.

<p>
And, as Kathy writes, so is she written about.  EVERYWHERE.  
She has been praised, vilified, adored, hated, applauded and abused.  
She has been portrayed as the Mona Lisa in color lithographs (an 
expensive process), satirized in numerous cartoons and characterized as 
the ``Bloodsucker" in several games:

<p>
``Bloodsucker?" repeated Vlad bemusedly.

<p>
``Yes, the most notorious, hideous, sadistic monster in history-a fiend 
in female form who..."

<p>
``Bloodsucker?"

<p>
``That's what they call her.  Because..."

<p>
Vlad sighed and clasped his hands to his chest.  ``I tink," he said, ``I 
tink I am in luff." [Excerpt from Bob Osuch's <i>Mass Murders</i> subzine.  
Vlad was the wonderful press writer Bob Olsen's nom de plume]

<p>
All of this fascination with, and public comment on, the hobby's 
foremost female and one of its few women has magnified Kathy's every 
success, stab and failure.  On her person, the hobby tends to project 
its prejudices of ``Woman".  Frequent cartoons about Kathy tend to show 
the two extremes of how she is regarded:  A sultry sexy temptress or a 
brutal female ferocity.

<p>
At last year's GenCon East, Al Pearson, pubber of <i>Just Among 
Friends</i>, handed out ``I Was BYRNED at GenCon East certificates with boxes 
to check for the ``Type of Byrne" (lst-, 2nd-,3rd-degree or Rear End 
Byrne).  This year Kathy has been awarded the 1981 ``Nixon Award" for 
being the ``Biggest Liar of the Year". 

<p>
Once when Kathy announced she was sharply curtailing her 
involvement in the hobby, Dave Carter, pubber of <i>Sleepless Knights</i>, 
wrote:  ``I'm glad that Kathy isn't completely leaving the hobby.  I'd 
have a hard time explaining to my future grandchildren how I was the 
only one in the PBM Diplomacy Hobby (circa '70s and '80s) who was not 
stabbed by the infamous KB."  To which Kathy replied, ``Thanks Dave, I 
needed that!" and ended her curtailment plans.

<p>
Her techniques vary in different games.  There is no pinning 
her down.  Eric Ozog, pubber of <i>Diplomacy By Moonlight</i>, said:  ``I was 
``Byrned" at GenCon East.  I was Turkey.  Byrne was Russia.  She allied 
with me at the start and then stabbed me horribly.  Kathy's tactics are 
amazing.  She always pulls this 
`dumb-broad-I-can't-make-my-mind-up-I'm-a-woman' routine.  And let me 
tell you is it effective."

<p>
After her postal win as Russia, her GM, Scott Hanson, pubber 
of <i>Irksome</i>, said:  ``This game should prove to the skeptics that Kathy 
Byrne is an expert at this game...sure she got all the breaks but 
someone has to be pulling the strings behind the scenes to make those 
breaks happen."

<p>
So Kathy is an excellent player both postally and 
face-to-face.  Her letters and phone conversations reveal a very 
friendly and witty personality with a made-to-be-mocked Brooklyn accent. 
But what is she like in person some of you who have only known her via 
print may be asking?

<p>
Mark Berch, pubber of <i>Diplomacy Digest</i>, said after meeting 
Kathy at GenCon East: ``Kathy Byrne: She is even more electrifying in 
person than she is in print.  She can effortlessly galvanize almost any 
group of people.  She virtually wiped up the floor with Sacks [Bob Sacks 
was the tournament director of GenCon East who intended to ban smoking 
totally at first.  Kathy is a smoker...]
when she did not approve of his no-smoking edict, and when she decided 
to leave a meeting, WHOOSH, she sweeps half the people out with her.  
Whether it was getting people to pose for her camera or making sure 
everybody noticed that she was going an entire game without stabbing Al 
Pearson, there was Kathy, an authentic, genuine live-wire."

<p>
Within the pages of <i>EUROPA EXPRESS</i>, Kathy has entered her 
first game with Europeans.  Already she is famous in Europe for her 
letters to Michel Liesnard, pubber of <i>Chanticler</i> in Belgium, whom she 
calls ``Cuddles".

<p>
Kathy Byrne is a genuine hobby phenomenon and an original.  
A quote from an American novelist, Ellen Glasglow, also fits Kathy well: 
``In her single person she managed to produce the effect of a majority."

<p>
But I will end this article with some lines which best 
describe Kathy to me since I have written to her, talked to her on the 
phone and met her and am now in a postal game with her.  These words are 
from Billy Joel: <i>The Stranger's</i> ``She's Always A Woman."

<p>
 ``She can kill with a smile/ She can wound with her eyes

<p>
 She can ruin your faith with her casual lies.

<p>
 And she only reveals what she wants you to see.

<p>
 She hides like a child/ But she's always a woman to me.

<p>
 She can lead you to live/ She can take you or leave you.

<p>
 She can ask for the truth/ But she'll never believe you.

<p>
 And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free.

<p>
 She steals like a thief/ But she's always a woman to me.

<p>
 Oh-she takes care of herself/ She can wait if she wants.

<p>
 She's ahead of her time.

<p>
 Oh-and she never gives out/ And she never gives in.

<p>
 She just changes her mind/ She will promise you more than the Garden of Eden.

<p>
 Then she'll carelessly cut you/ And laugh while you're bleeding.

<p>
 But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be.

<p>
 Blame it all on yourself/ 'Cause she's only a woman to me.

<p>
 She is frequently kind/ And she's suddenly cruel.

<p>
 She can do as she pleases/ She's nobody's fool.

<p>
 But she can't be convicted/ She's earned her degree.

<p>
 And the most she will do is throw shadows at you / But she's always a 
woman to me.

<p>
<br /><br />
<p>
<br /><br />And now I finally get to the usual header stuff.
I decided to can the sub price increase, the postal rate increase
really is peanuts, or it seems so at the 3-5 ounce level that I live it.
So, no problem, let's keep selling subs when I can at this price.
You all know that I'm an incredible softie anyway.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance).

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
But as I said, he would prefer if most of the tributes and notes
get published here.
The future of the League of course is a bit up in the air, though
it looks like we will finish the season.
Last week John demanded (and we obey ALL his demands) that we 
attempt to behave ``normally'', so we resumed our puffed up 
touting of our teams in E-Mail chat.
But I was telling Kathy all season that I wanted to face her in
the World Series, and of course that will no longer be possible.
Kathy won three World Series in this league over the years, most
recently just last year.

Find him and win the fifty buck prize!!
You have until Issue number 265.

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target

The British representative is the editor of

E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com

Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals Underway!!

<p>
This is possibly the most prestigious and hard fought E-Mail
tournament around (only challenged by Doug Massey's Vermont
Group Tournaments or the Australian E-Mail Tournament), now
with FOUR full rounds.
The final players (with current SC standing, which is what
counts in a C-Diplo based tournament) are:

<p>
AUSTRIA: Jack Brawner - Find Jack at TrojanOwl of aol.com,
and he is not doing very well as I see it, with 5 centers at the 
end of 1907, but he seems to be suiciding out with Turkey 
taking his centers.
There's no reason for that in C-Diplo, so I don't get it.

<p>
ENGLAND: Mike Weinzimer - Find Mike at mweinzimer of yahoo.com, 
and he is back up to his 3 home centers at the end of 1907,
but is he out of trouble?

<p>
FRANCE: Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu - Find Joe at janbu of online.no,
and he is knocked down to 6 centers at the end of 1907, but
there's plenty of time for a comeback.

<p>
GERMANY: Douglas Vaughan - Find Douglas at vaughan4 of mindspring.com,
and he is really surging at this point, now with 7 centers at the 
end of 1907, and he is being really, really sneaky.
Can he win??

<p>
ITALY: Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira - You can find Egg at egbert of salavip.com.br,
and he is now eliminated at the end of 1907, poor, poor Egg....

<p>
RUSSIA: Darren Koch - You can find the Aussie Darren at koch_family of bigpond.com,
and he is holding strong at 7 centers at the end of 1907,
he still just has that ONE fleet in the Norwegian Sea.

<p>
TURKEY: Frank Johansen - Find Frank at frank.johansen of diplomacy.no,
and he is still moving up, back to 6 centers at the end of 1907, 
as his comeback continues.

<p>
The wondrous Peter Richardson pjrich of ntlworld.com is the GM.
If you want to follow the game, send an E-Mail to 
mailserver of cat23.com with the following message:

<p>
 The history of the WorldMasters tournament is that it is not necessarily
THE best player who wins, but the format and style seem to reward effort.
The player who works the hardest likely will win.  
Jack, Joe, and Douglas all look good at this point, with Egg out and Mike
struggling to survive.
I know lots of you can't stand C-Diplo, but that's the way it works....
I think the game goes until 1912, so there is lots more play in it, though
France looks quite strong.

the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the ``current'' as well as an older
version of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older

What do Chris Martin, David Norman, Tim Richardson and Edi Birsan have in
common?  They're all planning to attend Tempest in a Teapot IV this October
11-13.

<p>
Join with us, the Potomac Tea &amp; Knife Society, at the Silver Spring Hilton,
8727 Colesville Road, Silver Spring, MD for Tempest IV will feature three
rounds of Diplomacy over three days. We will use the established PTKS
scoring system and standard PTKS tournament rules.  Visit www.ptks.org for
more info, too!

<p>
Travel to the Washington area is easy, and PTKS will transport its
out-of-town guests from any of our three local airports (Washington
National, BWI, and Dulles). Autumn is a great time to visit us; most of the
tourists have returned to their homes and the weather is usually quite nice.
PTKS members will be standing by to facilitate sightseeing and
transportation needs. For hotel questions or to make a reservation call us
at 1-800-645-5901

<p>
The preregistration rate for Tempest IV will be $20, due by September 15.
After that, the price will increase to $30.  
Sorry, but it's getting kind of expensive to do this show.
So be sure to register NOW!
You won't want to miss the intrigue, lying, deceit and bloodletting that
Tempest is known for.  Besides, Andy Bartalone double-dog dares anyone to
come and try to beat him on on the boards.

<p>
For more information, contact Andy Marshall (landruajm of netscape.net), the
Tournament Director, or Steve Mauris (sjmauris of hotmail.com),  the Tempest
Chairman.

<p>
Hotel Directions -
From Baltimore/Washington International:
Start out going West towards I-195 W by turning left.
Stay straight to go onto I-195 W.
Take the I-95 SOUTH exit, exit number 4B, towards WASHINGTON.
Merge onto I-95 S.
Take the I-495 WEST exit, exit number 27-25, towards COLLEGE PARK(US-1)/
SILVER SPRING.
Keep RIGHT at the fork in the ramp.
Merge onto CAPITAL BELTWAY/I-495 W.
Take the US-29 SOUTH/COLESVILLE RD exit, exit number 30B, towards SILVER
SPRING.
Merge onto COLESVILLE RD/US-29 S.

<p>
Just ask our previous Tempest guests: PTKS knows how to show its friends a
good time.
Registration information on Tempest will be emailed to our mailing list and
to a large market sample of the hobby by August 15.

The 12th annual Hickcon has now been set to take place at Jon Kwiatkowski's 
house in Boone on September 27-29.  I think 4:00pm or after would be OK on 
arrival time; we generally leave in the early afternoon on Sunday.  
If you have never been to Hickcon before, it is our housecon which roves 
around North Carolina every year.  We play all sorts of things, generally 
not including any Diplomacy.  Attendence is usually in the 8-12 range, but 
some years we have had more.  If you have anyone in mind who might also want 
to come, let me know that when you respond.  

<p>
Jon can be contacted by phone at 828-264-4870.  As far as directions go, 
get to Boone and get on the main road through downtown.  Then take Green 
St off to the right, heading north.  Right turn onto Green Heights, quick 
left onto West Queen St.  Follow that around until you see Charles St on 
your right.  He is at the end of the street, 298 Charles St.

<p>
Please let me know if you are interested.  We may be able to do some 
carpooling.  I know that Duewer is flying into RDU and then coming in 
the car with Bruce Allen - so maybe we could do some similar things for others.

<p>
<i>((Can I publicize this??))</i>

<p>
You probably don't have time to publicize.  I mainly included you 
because you keep such a close finger to the pulse of the hobby 
that you would want to know what is going on in the southern hinterlands...

I had pulled out my old Colonia map that I mounted onto cardboard probably 
12 years ago with the concept of volunteering to standby in that game.  
I cannot believe the losses we have suffered recently - I fondly remember 
playing Colonia one time with Fred Hyatt as GM, Gene Prosnitz as ally, 
Robert Stimmel as enemy, and Bob Acheson as another player on the board...

I was saddened to hear of his passing.  
When I first got the game back in Christmas 65, Gene was one of the adults that I 
played with through out the 60's.  
He also was the very first victim of the Lepanto Openning in a 1966 
face to face game in New York.  
He was an intense player and along with his wife Sandy an excellent 
host in those early days of the New York Conspiracy.  
I will miss the possibilities to add to those memories with new ones that include him.

<br /><br /> ``Blue Crush" - a movie

<p>
The titles say that this is based on the magazine article `Surf Girls of 
Maui'.  Very loosely based.  The article was about women surfers, 
highlighting several.  It also was about the recent rules changes in surfing 
competition.  

<p>
For years surfing competition was male dominated.  That was because most of 
the surfers who competed were men.  Then women started competing seriously.  
Not a problem for several years.  Then women started winning.  Suddenly, for 
`safety reasons' the men instituted `separate but equal' competitions for men 
and women.  This was supposedly so the women wouldn't hurt themselves trying 
to compete against men.  Yeah, right.  Women have a natural superiority when 
it comes to surfing.  They are lighter, they have a lower center of gravity, 
and all else being equal, that gives them a tremendous edge.  So, for `safety 
reasons' they were sent into competing against each other.  Same waves, same 
beaches, just no way to beat a man at his own game.

<p>
``Blue Crush" is about a surfer girl named Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) who 
dominated the competition when in high school (another truth about surfing is 
that all else being equal kids are better than adults.  Its that same kids 
are lighter and have lower center of gravity than adults.  Of course, adults 
have experience going for them.)  Shortly after that competition two things 
happened.  The rules were changed, and Anne Marie wiped out trying to run the 
pipe.

<p>
The pipe in Maui is a wall of water 60 or 70 feet high that curls over the 
top as the wave breaks forming a near tube of water that moves across the 
front of the wave, sometimes for as much as a half a mile.  Some really 
talented surfers with no concept of mortality sometimes ride the mouth of 
this tube.  If they wipe out, tons of water drive them right to the bottom.  
Many of them die.  Anne Marie survived her wipeout.  She still remembers it 
though.  She dreams about it, she thinks about it every time a really big 
waves forms under her.  She backs off.

<p>
There are some good characters, some great surfing.  Mostly the movie fills 
the time between the surfing.  Still, there were some great moments.  
Teaching football players to surf was fun.  The real high point was when Anne 
Marie was in the Rip Masters competition (invitational) and backing off her 
wave.  The woman who was competing against her became her coach and got her 
to take the wave.

<p>
Of course, she wiped out.

<p>
Living through it gave her a new insight.  She and her new coach got her onto 
an even better wave.

<p>
I liked the movie.  The incidental love story could have been replaced with 
more surfing, but maybe that's just me.

Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.

<p>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly.
You also can sign up for the next Breaking Away game, which is starting now.
Tom Howell currently is signed up, knock off the superstar, come on,
you can do it!!
So far, Eric Brosius wants to challenge Tom.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Harold Reynolds is willing to start a game of Colonia and one of Aberration.
I am presently the only one signed up for the Colonia game. 

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper is the only one signed up for that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed
and with all of this with Kathy Byrne Caruso I didn't have a chance
to do the final Endgame chart.
You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<p>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and would like
to volunteer to guest GM a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next ``big'' game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, so we need eight more to get it going.
I know there are others, could Harold give me a count?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FRET draw is rejected again and both the
FRET and FREGT draws are reproposed.
Please vote again with your Winter orders.
Generally you need to vote again unless you insist to me that
a vote you have made wants to be perpetual.
A failure to vote may not veto a draw.
I have noted that I don't have a specific rule about calling
a draw with no movement.
You just play on, BUT what I am doing is calling on my rule
for allowing failure to vote on the draws counting as a ``yes''.
This is done with warning.
Starting with these Winter orders, you have to vote EVERY season
or your no vote or failure to vote becomes a ``yes''.
This is the ``fair warning'' before I do that.
Initially this will NOT count those of you who have given me 
perpetual draw votes, but after another period of no movement,
everyone will have to vote on the draws every season.

<p>
2) I've had requests about ``speeding up'' the game.
This is certainly possible, but it only can be done (i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;making this
upcoming deadline Spring instead of the quiet Winter) with the permission of
all players.
Thus, I'm not sure it matters in this situation, but feel free to 
tell me that your orders for future seasons are good for a quicker 
run of seasons.  We could sail through a game year every other issue
if you want.
If there are no Winter adjustments, be sure to tell me if you are submitting
Spring 1912 orders that can be used right away.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): Don't let that lackey Germany live! He doesn't
deserve a part of the draw!

<p>
(GER-RUS):  I am more free than you.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<p>
2) There everyone is in their new slots.
Pretty neat, eh?

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-MULLER): I note your threat to ``Bomb The Leader". I also note that 
I am now ``The Leader". The bad news is that this means I will be nuked (as 
Russia) in 1903. The good news is that I will be justified in nuking people 
in return in 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1907. (I hold grudges). I could even nuke 
you, as Italy, in 1903 in view of your threats. But in the end, as an Evil 
Empire, I'll nuke Russia's historical enemy of Turkey. Three nukes on Turkey, 
and maybe the 4th on the GM? Sounds like a good plan whilst I deal with Real 
World problems.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-RAUTERBERG): I don't understand why you stabbed England for London, 
when Belgium was yours for the asking.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-SCHULTZ): And are you going to let Rauterberg get away with it? 

<p>
(JOHN - HARRY):  Hell...Harry, nuke the hell outta 
me...I need a tan.

<p>
(``THE MAN WHO IS NO MAN" to OTHER PLAYERS): I got 9 SCs and you don't. Nyah 
nyah nyah!

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HALBERT (being able to hold (unfazed) more beer than most strong folks
can carry using a large cask and a wheelbarrow) to DANA):  What ya do,
see, is tie one of these maroon ribbons to the back of one of your
opponent's seats, then hang on until he's winded.  Then, ya peddals as
hard as ya can!  What's that yellow pissy lookin' stuff ya's drinking,
anyway?  Here, let me buy YOU a good beer.

<p>
<b>End game statement from Tom Howell</b>:

<p>
At the risk of belaboring the obvious, let's go to the rules.  The rules
tell one how to play the game.  The rules also tell one how to win the
game.  I'll try to divide this into strategy and tactics.  Strategy
first:

<p>
One wins by scoring the most points.  Where does the individual cyclist
score the most points?  At the finish line, of course!  Any given place
is worth twice as much at the finish as at one of the sprint lines.  In
fact, a place as low as 4th at the finish is worth a first place at a
sprint.  So, as far as I'm concerned, only first or second places in a
sprint are worth devaluing any of my riders' cards.  In other words,
building card values for a high final finish place is more important
than scoring at a sprint line.  This is particularly true of the first
sprint line.

<p>
But, up to a point:  If I don't score any points in either sprint, my
riders will
have to do very well at the finish.  So, if possible, I'll try to get my
riders' cards built up so they can score well at the second sprint and
keep pushing to the finish line.

<p>
A corollary:  Spreading the points between my opponents can be as
important as grabbing points for myself.  With only four riders, and
eight scoring places at each scoring line, I can help myself by
helping a rider of a low-scoring team garner some of the points I won't
get.  I can do this by
playing a card which will enable the rider I want to help replenish with
a big card.

<p>
(Unless the player in question has proven to be very predictible in his
moves, I'll propose some cooperation to help him score some points.)

<p>
Which leads to:

<p>
Tactics:  To score big points, one needs big cards.

<p>
First off:  the more cards a rider has, the more flexibility that rider
has.  I always give my ``A" rider four cards!  Otherwise, he will tend to
surge to the front of the pack too early, and soon only holds low value
cards.

<p>
In the early turns, one wants to build up his riders' card values.  One
does this, of course, by riding near the back.  Holding only three (or four)
cards, each rider's options are limited.  One must know the spaces to
which his
riders can move as well as the possible spaces of all the other teams'
riders.  Equally
important, is knowing where riders can not move.  This information
allows one to calculate moves most likely to return high value
replenishment cards.

<p>
An illustration:  say my ``B" rider is on space 60, and holds a three,
a four and a seven.  He could move to 63, 64 or 67.  If no other rider
can land on 65, playing the four will devalue his hand by a point,
because his replacement has to be a 3.  Which is better to play, the
three or the seven?  Depends on where the other riders are.  If ``B" is
in the back of the pack, he's probably better off playing the seven
because otherwise he's only going to fall farther and farther behind. 
However, if no one can move to 68, it might be better to play the three,
in hopes that the seven will get him a better replacement card on a
future turn.  Of course, if ``B" in in the middle or front of the pack,
he should play the three and drop back into the pack where his
replenishment cards will have higher values.

<p>
I find playing face-to-face much less stressful than postal Breaking
Away!  Since each rider moves sequentially, I can watch the pack reform
and make informed moves.  Postally, I have to try to guess where all the
other riders are likely to move, then try to second guess whether a
different move for them makes more sense based on where I decide to move
my riders.

<p>
So there's another part of the picture:  if my opponents make moves I
can anticipate, it's easier for me.  Some do, some don't.

<p>
Of course, a good spreadsheet helps.  Unfortunately, the one I'm using
isn't all I could wish it to be...

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
2) Thanks to Kurt Ozog, but Sean has returned!
Thanks, Sean!!

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``It's hard to be human, human again...''
From <i>Fear and Whiskey's</i> ``Hard to be Human".

<p>
(BRITAIN to UKRAINE): Oh, no, you don't!  Not behind 
my lines...sonny.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG ``NO JOY IN TREKVILLE''):  As ordered by Starfleet, I have 
ordered a military offensive against the Romulans.
I do this with great reservations because I had developed a good working
relationship with the Romulan commander.
The first battle was moderately successful, but only by luck and a minor
ruse I pulled off.
We took a frontline Romulan starbase and we scuttled one of their troop
transports.
We were lucky because the Klingons' frontline and backup communications
array failed, causing total paralysis of the entire Klingon fleet and this
might hurt us down the line.
A strange thing happened as the battle approached.
I got a message from ``Q'' warning me about the Klingon communication problem.
I've never known ``Q'' to help anyone, let alone the Klingons.
<i>((``Q'' had suspended the Federation communication array, so Kirk was
not in control of the Enterprise, it had to follow the commands that Sulu
and Chekov already had entered into their consoles.))</i>
When I tried to contact the Klingons, their backup system also was down (the Grafton 
phone system was out) and by the time my shuttle was able to make it to the 
Klingon summit (Uncle Chip's party) where I could actually talk to Commander Worf,
it was too late.
The entire Universe is not united against the Romulans.
If victorious, we can easily divide the Romulans into four separate spheres of
influence to ensure ``peace in our times''.
It's going to be a long war.
As a precaution, Mr.&nbsp;Spock is suggesting that all of Vulcan be required to
learn how to speak ``Romulan''.
