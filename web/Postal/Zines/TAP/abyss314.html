<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is going to be a very short, get the adjustments out issue.  And in fact, I'm 
mailing issues #313 and #314 together, so if you're seeing this first on the web
and saying "gee, I've not seen #313 in the post yet" you are quite right, you haven't.
This gets me all caught up and back on track though, and that's important for the games.
Probably the next few issues are going to be a bit light on reading materials as I just
try to crank some games out for awhile.  
Thanks for understanding.
All that being said, we have lots of subszines, even with <i>Octopus' Garden</i> being
back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also Jeff O'Donnell has to back out of all of his games, so I'm appointing standbys 
in each one who are taking over with these adjustment orders.
In light of that (and my own difficulties in staying on schedule) I'm extending the
deadlines a bit to the 22nd to compensate for Spring.
We're all very concerned about Jeff. 
On the good side, he sounds good (cell phone is the best way to reach him),
but he just cannot play at this time.
I hope things get better for him and he can return later, but we need to keep
the games going, so thanks to all the standbys.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

I also have taken over the Postal port/DipPouch/Postal

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back at least sometimes.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games
and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York and Doug Kent have been my most frequent subszine guests lately!!!
Andy has been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And Doug Kent has been coming out faster than <i>TAP</i> lately, so
many issues have been having multiple <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s. 
And Michael Lowrey gets his in every few issues too!
So, we have a full set of subszines at the moment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With the 100th issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i> upcoming, the ONLY
former publisher who has not definitively been located is Jerry
Jones.  Doug Kent and I have some idea where he is, but we've not
succeeded in getting him to respond to us.  Find him and win
a fifty dollar prize, only one more issue to do that before 
we move on to the next victim!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am running out of people on MY list of who to search for, so
I am looking for ideas, who would you like to find?
Send me some names.
I may go into Jim Meinel's Encyclopedia of North American Diplomacy
szines and find some more szine editors to search for, that's
what I usually do, but I'd like to find people that some of you
will search for or want to find!!!
Come on, help me out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no

We were running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but might next issue.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: 
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.

<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno (Wed, 19 Dec 2007 22:24:40 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of my favorite local bands, the Parlor Cats from Binghamton, NY 
(known as "the Parlor City" a century ago) has their first CD out.  
It's called <i>Help Me!</i> with an exclamation point and with the band's 
frontman looking to weasel a way out of jail for the band.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They did well to select a theme and opening song that lots of people 
might know: "Help Me", which was written by Sonny Boy Williamson II 
(Aleck "Rice" Miller, the second "Sonny Boy Williamson").  
The song was a hit for SBW2, for Junior Wells, for John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, 
and for Van Morrison.  (I found this Horrid Example, category Pronouns, 
in the liner notes from the Rhino Records anthology 
<i>Blues Masters Volume 4: Harmonica Classics</i>:  "A young disciple 
of Williamson's was Junior Wells, who recorded `Help Me' as a tribute to 
Williamson shortly after his death."  Wells recorded postmortem?  
Maybe that's why it can sound so eerie.)  
I just listened to Williamson's version (with Matt Murphy on guitar) and the 
Parlor Cats' new one back-to-back.  They sound plenty different but the crying
harp gives the same feeling.  That sets the tone for the whole album: authentic
traditional postwar blues, led by HOT HOT HOT harmonica and (often slide) 
electric guitar.  Even the originals (more than half the songs) sound 
like they could have been written in Chicago in the 1940s.  
The title song is also a tribute to Rod Piazza (of Rod Piazza and the Mighty Flyers), 
who turned Brian Potenziano onto this kind of music and helped him learn 
how to make a harp howl and wail:  the song's intro and outro are an answering 
machine message from Piazza, who wrote the arrangement used here.  
Brian P plays through the Rod Piazza modification
of the Harp King amp from Kinder Instruments, and this gives GREAT sound.  
You don't lose the most soulful sounds; they fill the room and they come 
through on the recording.  The other covers are also familiar 
(and happy) for old-blues fans...  Willie Dixon's "Back Door Man" was 
first released by Howlin' Wolf (1961), and was covered by the Doors (1967), 
the Grateful Dead, Shadows of Knight, Bob Weir, Harmonica Slim &amp; 
Hosea Leavy, Sam Gopal, Frank Marino, and Quicksilver Messenger Service 
if the Wikipedia entry I'm seeing is correct.  On this one, the 
'Cats sound more like Howlin' Wolf than like the later versions.  
It feels raw, which is right for this song.  There's another Willie Dixon 
song, "Dixon City", which was a multiple hit under the title 
"Bring It On Home": first for Sonny Boy Williamson (the second one again) 
in 1959, then by Led Zeppelin on the very influential <i>Led Zeppelin II</i> 
in 1969.  There's Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson's "Alimony Blues", and 
Junior Wells' 1960 "Messin' With The Kid".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The originals are as hot as the covers, and being pretty much 
good ol' blues and a bit of swing, they're easy to pick up on; 
after a couple of listens, they can become almost as familiar as the 
oldies-but-goodies.  Brian P's "Love My Baby" is just dirty enough that 
it could have been written by Eddie Vinson in the days when he couldn't 
record many of his best songs.  
"The Bounce" is credited to "Swan, Osterhout and Brown" because 
it's what Brian S, Jamie, and John play first
after break, when Brian P is still drinking.  
Brian P's "Lazy Lovin' Woman" has a fun bounce and some nice sleazy lyrics.  
Jamie-O's &#220;ptown Strut" and Brian P's "Be My Friend" and "Don't Tell Me" 
get it done in various ways.  The last original on the album is 
"The Parlor Cat Boogie", which (as you might guess from the
title) is a swing strut.  
It's lots of fun, especially at live shows when Brian P takes his harp 
and a wireless mic around the audience, playing wild licks while peeping 
over people's shoulders.  This worked well at the last two years' 
Blues on the Bridge festival in Binghamton.  
All the Parlor Cats original songs that I hear, on this CD or at live shows, 
show both originality and understanding of where this music came from.  
They rock, in some of the ways that R&amp;B rocked so people so hard 
that rock'n'roll overpowered conformist society.  
Some of them make me dance as readily as my favorites among their oldies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So I recommend their CD (contact information is on www dot theparlorcats dot com), 
and I recommend their live shows, which so far have been in 
Binghamton (NY) and the surrounding counties.  
I've been hearing them various bars and restaurants for over a year, 
and every show is lively and colorful.  Most songs are a bit
different each time and it always sounds fresh and real.

<i>((Mega-cool, and thanks for the CD, let's get my own little review out here.
Just so the band and the public don't think I'm a shill for them, let me start with
the nits to pick.
You could really see how "The Parlor Cat Boogie" is a huge hit at their live shows,
but this one drags a bit as car or home listening.
It doesn't help that Willie D.'s "Backdoor Man" then starts off a bit slow
(only in comparison to the original, of course, in the vocals and intensity), 
though I did like that rhythm that I guess drummer John Brown is playing out
on the sticks.
Luckily for us it really builds though as we get "shot full of holes"
and finishes the disc with you wanting and begging for more.
For this one it is better once it leads with the instrumentals.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I thought front man Brian Potenziano was better singing his own songs.
Mike, you and I did not quite agree, as perhaps my favorite song on the
entire disk that really made my hips shake was "Be My Friend" that 
makes me really like their tricks!!!
So it is the tongue that does it, eh?
Well, let me be clear, <b>I'm</b> not looking for Brian's tricks, but if he
gets the crowd moving, I'm all for it.
This tune also reflects what I thought was the strength of the band, you
emphasized the hot, hot heat, but I'd emphasize the restrained coolness.
"Love My Baby", another Potenziano original pops up next keeping up the 
back door metaphors and the cool moving.
I don't think I want to be ANYWHERE near any back door with these guys.....
I liked this one much better at home than on the road where the subtleties
of the smoldering feeling get lost a bit.
It does remind me of Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson who I was lucky enough 
to see live in the early 1980's before his death in mid-decade or so.
I think I've not heard "Alimony Blues", the song of his here, since then!
I think they would be best in a dirty, grimy blues bar.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((On the other hand, while you correctly identify that Brian Potenziano hits
the harp with a West Coast soulful sound (tutored by Tom Townsley), my harp
tastes lean a bit more toward the folk sounds of our Providence based pal
Chris Turner (who hosts a MEAN.... New Year's Day party), you can find
Chris, also protecting him from the spammers and crazies at 
www dot fiddleandharmonica dot com.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Potenziano
was great, it just some of it was not my favored style of harp playing.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((What I really liked were Brian Swan's guitar solos, especially the ones on 
the Potenziano compositions "Love My Baby" and "Don't Tell Me",
and especially on the lead song "Help Me!"
I highly recommmend the <b>Essential John Mayall</b>, 
with the disk <b>Exclusive Live Rarities</b> for "Help Me!" featuring Mick Taylor.
I'm more of a Mayall guy, I don't have any original SBW II recordings,
but I thought they stood up to Mayall and Taylor, better praise isn't possible
from me.
As a whole a great starting disk, they probably need a touch more range
to make a truly great album, but for the most part I liked their originals
as much or more than the covers, so that suggests promise.
Thanks much for turning me on to the Parlor Cats, Mike!!))</i>

<i>((Baseball: get your predictions and comments on the new season in 
to me for next issue.
The local Red Sox will be off to Japan, that should be interesting.
Will Barry Bonds play again?
Do we care whether anyone talks about Roger Clemens again?
I maintain my view that the "ignore the steroids because they don't 
matter" stance that baseball took in the 1990's and the "everything
people did depended on steroids" stance are equally nonsensical.
What needs to happen is light, some rules that can be monitored
and enforced and a growing understanding that what was was.
I find it immensely fascinating to watch how people react to this
story.
And yes, I still am a fan of Barry Bonds and I hope he eventually 
achieves the peace with his life that he's struggling for.
I hope Barry plays and stays well ahead of A-Rod, who I am most 
definitely NOT a fan of.))

1) Note Fred Wiedemeyer's two new E-Mail addresses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) As we will see in all of these games that Jeff O'Donnell has
to resign.  We wish him the best, of course.  Our new player is Heath Gordon.
This is Heath's first postal game and his debut in the szine.  
I trust that all of you will welcome him appropriately.
Heath, some of this crowd send postal letters, some E-Mails, and some 
call people on the phone. 
You'll figure it out.
We've played only two game years, let me know if you have any questions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) We also greet Heath Gordon with a proposal that he share in a two way draw
with Austria. 
There is a proposal for an RA two way draw.
Please vote with your Spring orders, failure to vote vetoes the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 5 (DARK PRESS - NOT FOR ATTRIBUTION) THE LADY RATTA-TAT-TATTED LACE):
So much for a shot in the dark.  It's not so much that I knew less than I knew 
before, it's just that now I knew what I knew wasn't enough to know what to do.   
A little work and that could be a Doctor Seuss riff, of course it would mean 
working in a gnu, but I didn't have that kind of motivation.  
I was frustrated, broke and hadn't had a drink in six paragraphs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I watched as night bled into early day, and the bandage that was the 
streetlights timed off, letting the wound seep through to a halting, 
fit starting diorama of activity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 A newsboy started bleating out headlines...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>"Extra! Extra!  Read all about it... England Retreats Picardy.  
Forced to Disband!"</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 My pique left me totally unappreciative of such a genius move.  
I was inert, despondent, devoid of perspective.  
I was a flatfoot with a mystery, which is better than a flatfoot without a mystery, 
but I had no clue what my next step was.  
Then again, this is when I do my best thinking.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "I think I'll have a beer."  See, told ya so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>"Extra, Extra.  Malice, heir to Centerland dynasty absconded into darkness!"</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The important thing was to stay focused, stay alert.  
If things were unfolding, if it was as big as Flat said it was, 
there would be indications... signs... okay, clues.  
And when it comes to clues, well that is my business.  
I'm just saying I didn't get to where I was today without having a good nose for clues.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>"Extra, Extra.  Maltese Dipcon reported missing!"</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Now the paperboy had my attention.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "Hey, you got a racing form?"  I asked him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "No sir, just the Daily..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>"Then what are you hollering for!"</b>  Sheesh, I could get this 
aggravation anywhere, no need to hang around here.  
Macgillicutty's then.  
It hit me that I had a hot blond and a cold bottle of 
Cheater's waiting for me at home.  
I sashayed the fifteen szines home while I mulled over what I knew of the case. 
Elephants, otters and something important was missing. 
The only thing I knew for sure was that I needed a gnu for a rhyme.  
Baby needs a gnu pair of shoes, are you gonna like it once the 
gnu wears off, gnu and improved... free association is the 
devil's playground, that's what I always say...
actually I say a lot of other things, I don't always say that.  
In fact, I don't think I've ever said that before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By then I was home and it was turning out to be an okay day.  
Burgess hadn't changed the locks and the lights were on.  
Life is measured in small victories. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I went back into the Abyssinian Prince and climbed the stairs 
to my office.  I was expecting to find the blond from the 
Copasetic in full come hither mode, 
but naked with a machine gun was a little forward even for me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Baby, I'm not that hard a sell," I told her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Sweetface, keep your hands where I can see 'em," she smiled at me. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The lips were still the glossy red I remembered from issue #313.  
The eyes a deep blue that you could lose yourself in... 
okay, who am I kidding.  
She was naked, with a machine gun, but she was naked.  
Bazooms the size of Voice of Doom's old mailing list, 
a waist as thin as Ellinger's strategy, and her ass...
well, what can I say; she was facing me holding a machine gun.  
I'll describe her ass when she turns around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So, how ya doing?"  I am renowned for my repartee after all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I am holding a machine gun, y'know." She smacked her gum as she talked.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, actually it makes you even hotter."  
Hard to believe she blushed at that, but since she was naked, the blush was definitely verifiable.  Trust, but verify. Ronnie was right about that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I gotta ask you some questions."  
She waved the barrel of the tommy gun indicating I should sit in one of my chairs.  
So I just sorta made myself at home. Seemed appropriate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Shoot... well, no I mean... go ahead," I said.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Where are you on this case?"  
She tossed her head a little at the interrogative, giving the hair a sort of flip.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I've been following up leads, gathering information. 
I'm at my usual starting point... confused as hell."  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She licked her lips, giving a fresh coat to the wetness of the redness 
with the pinkness of her tongue... ness.  No, overkill.  
"So, do you know where the Hierophant is?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I do not know anything about any damn elephant.  
I don't even know why you're in my office naked."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm in your office to find out what you know.  
I'm only naked because you're writing this," she said huskily.  
Her words breathed out in pants.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"In that case, turn around."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah, an ass like... well you know that Final Conflict Diplomacy that took 
place on a global map?  Two of those.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Can we get back to business here," she twirled back to face me, 
the tommy gun dangling menacingly between her breasts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Sorry, hard to concentrate," I apologized, 
"you're the most beautiful woman I ever wrote."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She smiled at the flattery, again with the blush.  
Strong heart, good circulation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I modeled you after one of my exes. 
I can't remember if it was the one that left with the car, the dog or the house."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Oh, I'm not like that," she whispered,
"I would never leave you alone and lonely in the Hobby."  She waved the gun.  
"I’d kill you first, but never alone and lonely."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Gotta admire the honesty... and the jugs."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So, you're seeking the Diplonomicon too?"  
She said, her breasts heaved with punctuation. 
(In punctuation?  Every time I punctuate?!!, ,!!... ????!!... 
I need a cigarette... try a Red King)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Babe, I love you, or would like to, but all I'm seeking is the rent 
and the next day's down payment on the trifecta," 
I fished out the Red Kings from my coat pocket and tapped out a fag, 
"I don’t have a notion what a Diplonomiwashmajig is."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The Diplonomicon is an artifact of untold power.  
It can bend fate to its will, change the balance of power, 
accumulate vast wealth, and even polish Diplomacy press with its glamour..."
she exclaimed, her face awash in the ecstasy of her feeling, 
her arms, with the tommy gun gesticulating wildly in accompaniment, 
and her areola fully distended in the excitement of the moment.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Now that's impressive," I said.  
She looked at me quizzically, not sure if I was commenting on her narrative, 
or on her... or on her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She stared at me intently, "the Diplonomicon is a weapon of 
immense and catastrophic power.  
The board and blocks are manifestations of the dark force of the Tarot.  
The 112 stones, 56 of each in two shapes represent the Minor Arcana. 
The 22 starting positions represent the 22 cards of the Major Arcana, 
and the Hierophant is one of those major Arcana 
who is seeking to reunite the board and stones. IT IS NOT A DAMN ELEPHANT!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just looked at her.  A voluptuous, naked woman... in my home.  
I could overlook the tommy gun thing.  
I'm a guy.  We compartmentalize.  
It's hard to get past naked.  
But the whole detective part of me was latching onto the clues, 
putting it altogether 
(even as she was in her all together) and I still came up zilch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I don't understand any of this Major Minor Arkansas crap,"  
(steal the best lines you can find... that's what I always say), 
"what's this Hierophant got to do with me?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It's simple," she answered, the gun lowered to her side, 
"You are the Hierophant reversed."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 She said it solemnly, with weight.  Like it meant something.  
God bless her, because all I could think was; I thought 
Hierophant reversed was "Tnahporeih".

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) So, we had I) GIRF draw, II) GT draw, III) FAIRT draw, IV) Recalling 
Terry Tallman to play Germany.
On the last one, I don't have a note from Terry volunteering to return,
but since any one vote, or failure to vote, will veto the proposal, I will
presume that at least one person will check with Terry before voting yes
for this.
If everyone (including Eric, obviously) votes to have Eric leave and
Terry doesn't want to take back over, I will find another standby.
I don't see how that will happen, but thought I should be explicit and 
complete. 
Again, votes were due with the Winter orders, but I think I got such
little interest in any of these that I'll entertain more votes with the
Spring orders (and of course Jeff O'Donnell and/or Doug Kent didn't get
a chance to vote for the Italian position).

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Doug Kent takes over as the English player of record as I've not heard from 
Karl Schmit, I hope he's OK, probably just busy like we all are.
Thanks, Doug, for your quick and expert standby orders. 
As called for under the house rules, I do have draft Spring orders from Doug
that he can change if he wishes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I also made an error in the Supply Center Chart last time and put 35 units on 
it, giving Budapest to both Italy and Russia, Italy is of course sitting there,
so it does belong to Italy. 
As a result, Russia only gets ONE build.
Thanks for the eagle eye who caught that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) We also have to replace Jeff O'Donnell as France.
Jack McHugh will take over there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) And, there is a proposal for a concession to Turkey.
Please vote with your Spring orders.
If you fail to vote, that vetoes the proposal. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROM AUSTRIA): I propose a concession to Turkey and will vote for it.  
Now it's up to you guys to step up to the plate to stop Turkey.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I have to comment on this one!!!  I've never seen ten riders on a 
single space before.
And rookie Biker Andy York looks like a genius now, while Rick Desper's
riders missed the pack.
Remember that the Sprint Finish Line is after line 40, for the first 
time this turn, that can be reached.
That's a whole host of 7's awarded.
