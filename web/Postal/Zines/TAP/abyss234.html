<p><br><p><br>``Among other reasons why writers have praised Philopoemen, the leader of
the Achaeans, is that in time of peace he thought of nothing but the manner
of conducting war; and when he was out of the country with friends he would
stop and ask them: `If the enemy were on that hill and we had our army here,
which would have the advantage?  How could we advance on them in good order?
If we wished to retreat, how would we go about it?  If they were to retreat,
how would we pursue them?'  And as he went along he would set all the 
situations before them with which an army might be confronted.... thus,
thanks to these continued deliberations, when he was at the lead of his
army, no problem could ever arise for which he did not have a solution.''
Do you even have to ask whose quote this is??? 
No way.
But just to make you think about it, I'll tell you down in my response to
Richard Weiss' letter about the TV show <i>Survivor</i>, which is THE
show of the century for Dippers.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I know there have been some really terrible mailing delays of the szine in 
the US lately.
Issue 233 arrived in Jim Sayers mailbox in AUSTRALIA on June 5th (his usually
is the last player issue to be delivered) but some of you (more than one)
took even longer that that to get the issue!  
Amazing.
Then this issue is REALLY delayed.  I have spent the last three weekends on
trips for business to DC, upstate NY, and then LA (more on the last one in
a bit....) and that just makes it impossible to finish a dipszine.
Oh well.
I have set some longer deadlines that I am sure that I can stick to for
the next few issues.
See them attached to the games below.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
But there are some other options.
Mark Kinney is trying to get his dipszine going again (one game is
already filled), but he may have other openings.
Mark is looking for standbys too.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR SARA REICHERT - NOT!</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Don Williams wins the award for this one, with some assistance
from a number of people, including yours truly.
I will probably have more on this next time, and some of you
have already been alerted, but here was the mystery:

<p>
Sara Reichert gives a mailing address that happens to be the
residence of one Harry Andruschak (Harry gives his address
as a nearby postal box).  Plus, letters to me written by
Harry and ``Sara'' were addressed to me in the same handwriting.

<p>
The solution to the mystery: Harry and Sara are one in the same
person.
While in LA on my business trip, I hooked up with Don Williams
and we visited the address: 20805 Margaret, Carson, CA  90745-1224
(actually Don had visited it before but didn't uncover anything)
and we met Harry Andruschak, but there was no Sara Reichert.
Harry admitted to us that he indeed IS Sara Reichert.
Reichert is the last name of his landlady, Patricia Reichert -
the person that
Dippers had been led to believe was Sara's mother, but we
met her too (actually very Italian!) and she has no such daughter.
Brenton ver Ploeg previously had done some research that determined
that ``Sara Reichert'' had no Social Security Number, yet she had
supposedly been working at a series of temp. jobs.
I didn't quite get the allusion, but Harry/Sara had been telling
me for the last few months that Sara was off on a long term temp
job in Winnemucca, Nevada.  
I didn't connect this with the fact that Winnemucca is famous for
its cat houses..... well, that might explain the lack of an SSN.

<p>
I include a few notes below, including one from Harry, but expect
more will follow that I can print next time.
I think it was a great hoax, well deserving of hobby immortality.
After all, Sara fooled the hobby for SIX years.
Harry is in a bit of a natural mourning over the death of his
creation, but I salute him for pulling it off!
Harry never tried to use the pseudonym for direct advantage,
only the indirect advantage of ``playing'' a woman.
And that was done to GREAT advantage..... sorry, Eric, my best
bud, you were fooled! 

<p>
I will announce a new target next time,
or spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
Does anyone know her name?
This could be a way toward finding Jerry.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p><br><p><br><b>``Sara Reichert'' AKA Harry Andruschak (Mon, 26 Jun 2000 00:35:44 EDT)</b>

<p>
IT'S ALL KATHY CARUSO'S FAULT!

<p>
So there I was in 1994, barely alive.  Now I know most people do not like to
read or hear the sordid details of somebody else's health problems, so let me
just say that had I belonged to an HMO, I'd probably be dead now.  Blue
Cross/Blue Shield to the rescue, but, by the time I was well enough to write
again, I had NMRed all my games and had a lot of subscriptions to Diplomacy
zines had run out.

<p>
``For Idle Minds and Idle Hands, The Devil Finds a Work To Do".  Such as
re-reading the beginner's pamphlet MASTERS OF DECEIT and re-reading Kathy
Caruso's article titled ``Diplomacy-A Man's Hobby".   Go re-read it yourself
now before continuing with this article.  PLEASE remember that all this was
six years ago, and my mind was fogged with drugs, so I am not sure just what
my mental processes were at that time.  At first I found it hard to believe
Kathy's basic premise of how gullible males can be around women players.
Being of a scientific nature, somewhere in all this I wondered about an
experiment.  And so was born Sara Reichert.

<p>
Most people knew of my PO BOX address.  Few knew that I actually lived at
20805 Margaret, renting a room from a lady with the very real name of
Patricia Reichert.  So my landlady suddenly had a new daughter, age 16.   And
things ran away from me.  Boy, did they run away.

<p>
For example, here is what Kathy had to say about starting out:  ``As a female
novice you can use the `dumb broad" routine by playing helpless and stupid.
You can write and ask some `macho" man if he can help you because you are so
confused.  You'd be surprised how many knights in shining armor play
DIPLOMACY."  Such as Eric Ozog in Sara's very first game in the zine
CHEESECAKE, where she was France, Eric was Germany, and Sara went on to an 18
center win after stabbing her sweetie Eric for Munich and rolling over him to
victory.

<p>
Now read Kathy's next paragraph, and that is how Sara won her second game.
And in the paragraph after that, Kathy has another paragraph about flirting,
which explains why Sara's third game was a 2 way A/I draw with her as
Austria.  After that, the word was out that Sara had brains.   No more easy
wins or draws.  The hoax continued more out of inertia then any real need.
Simple as that.

<p><br><p><br><b>Brenton ver Ploeg (Sat, 12 Feb 2000 10:49:03 -0500)</b>

<p>
Now I can't say that the Judy Winsome effort started as anything more
than whimsical, but the woman fronting for Lucas turned out to be a charmer
(and if you find him, I'd like to know if he has a current address for her
for Christmas card purposes) so there were collateral benefits.
   
<p>
One of the attractions, however, was that the ringer in Judy's case was
from NORTHERN California, and the penis-enhanced person you describe (a) may
not even have a ringer, and (b) if he does, she lives South of Santa
Barbara, meaning that I'd have to re-learn the slang even to talk with her.
   
<p>
Still, it's an intriguing puzzle.  Based on my own hobby experience,
women players either were the subject of almost-exclusive telephonic
negotiation  (we're all nerds at heart, and to possess a legit reason to
chat up a female stranger-not to mention one who can't look us over-is a
prized opportunity), or invented some feeble excuse not to speak, in which
case they were obviously in the loathsome position of feigning breasts and
would be eliminated in the first year or two for toying falsely with our
fantasy, however dim or unrealistic, that an actual sexual act (well, one
with a female) might result from our participation in the hobby.
   
<p>
And that's why it's a puzzle.  I haven't seen but three or four Diplomacy
magazines in the past 20 years (sometimes I get courtesy copies when my name
surfaces, or it turns up on an unrelated internet search), but pretending to
be female must still be as prevalent in the hobby as it is in some of the,
ah, more specialized bars in our metropolitan areas.  Winning games under
such a cloak, however, is an entirely different thing, and couldn't be
accomplished without either disinterested or co-opted opponents.  I suspect
the latter.
   
<p>
There are plenty of ways for addresses to be matched with identities, as
anyone in our privacy-deprived age knows.  If you send me some more info, I
might easily get involved.  Or maybe not, depending on what is happening in
the real world with my lawsuits.
Anyway, this was fun.

<i>((Yeah, and Harry even has a plaque for Sara in winning the Hobby's
Best Player award a few years back.
Brenton went on to do a little research for me which established that
Harry Andruschak and Patricia Reichert both lived at the Carson address,
and NO evidence of the existence of a ``Sara Reichert''.
I've misplaced Brenton's follow up letter, but I may print it next
issue.
For myself, I will be keeping Sara's listing as playing in the NYEED
game until it ends.
I'm glad the mystery is now solved for sure.
I was worried when we went there that there was a real Sara Reichert
as Patricia's daughter that Harry would try to ``fool us'' with.
But no.
In time, Harry will realize that now was a good time to get caught.))</i>

Maybe I missed mention of this in your zine before, but I had no idea that 
the Marco Poll was still alive.  I started it back in 1981.  This would be 
the 20th year of it if it has been held every year.  I'm amazed.  And all 
those new categories!  Do you know if it still has the same scoring system?  
I had people vote for their 5 favorite zeens, with 5 points for a first place 
vote, 4 points for second, etc.  I'm not sure I consider it superior to the 
Runestone poll, even if it has proved to be more popular.  The polls didn't 
measure exactly the same thing.  The Marco poll measured popularity, while 
the Runestone graded quality.  It has probably helped the Marco poll to have 
a simple scoring system that everyone can understand.  That makes it easier 
for people to accept the results.  The last I saw of the Runestone poll was 
in the late 80s, when it had this 40-page statistical analysis (and some 
fawning over the winner).

Hello everyone,

<p>
As I warned last issue, I am traveling for most of June.  I am about
to take off again for another week and the szine is NOT done.  The
deadline for #235 is pushed back at least until July 8th 
<i>((Now the 15th.))</i>.  I hope
to finish it in the next window when I am in town next week, but it
could possibly be the week after that.  Apologies, just want to let
you all know what is going on.  Please inform the non-E-Mail players
as you communicate with them.

<p>
The other big news that I want to get on the table is that Stephen
Agar and I have agreed to take over the co-editorship of <i>Diplomacy
World</i>.  We already have an excellent editorial board that is working
on putting articles together but we could use more of both editorial
board members and articles for upcoming issues.  We currently have
a deadline of July 15 for articles for the comeback issue, so we
can get an issue out before World DipCon.  Stephen will be doing
layout, not me, so you can rest assured that it won't be as ugly
as <i>TAP</i> ;-)  I'll have lots more on this in <i>TAP</i> #234 when 
it comes out.  The delay has NOTHING to do with this decision, but with
work commitments (really!).  <i>DW</i> will be appearing in PDF format
and available for free by E-Mail or downloadable from the Web,
as well as having both US and British postal subscriptions.

<p>
Have a nice June everyone!

<i>((If you are interested in being on the E-Mail distribution list

The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll either find a commercial service or perhaps buy some new
equipment to get the copying done.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.

<p>
Jim,

<p>
My prediction for the basketball series: Lakers in 6. Lakers will win the
middle game in Indiana, lose the 5th game, then win the sixth one back at
home. Kobe will be in for game 5 but not at 100%. But the 90% will be good
enough.

<p>
If the Lakers lose game 4 I think they STILL win game 5 at Indiana and still
win the series in 6. But that would make things interesting...

<p>
I had also predicted they would win the first 2 and lose the 3rd in Indiana,
but I didn't share that prediction so you'll just have to take my word for
it  ;-)

<p>
Looking back on the season, people will say that the Lakers/Blazers series
was really the key series. The Lakers did not win game 7 of that series: the
Blazers lost it. And that was to be expected. I lived in Oregon for 7 years
and I've seen the Blazers' futility up close. It's ugly. That team has some
sort of complex. They don't think they deserve to win or something. One year
they'll get hungry enough (and confident enough), but this year wasn't it.

editors make extreme comments just to generate controversy and comments?
would that happen in dipdom??? ;)

<p>
i haven't seen american history x, though i've read a few reviews on it
(how else would i get to be a trivia master?). it sounds...interesting.
maybe i'll get it one of these days at the local video emporium.

<p>
you ought to run (do not walk) to see `high fidelity' at the first 
opportunity! i found myself identifying with waaaay too many of their
music addict mannerisms. (the best is when john cusack arranges his 
record collection - not chronologically, not alphabetically, not by 
genre - autobiographically, remembering when he got each album!)
<i>((Yes, this is perfect.
I have a friend who is JUST like the Cusack character.
I am only partly like it....))</i>

Hi Jim,

<p>
Do I take it you’ve been missing me? 
<i>((Quite frankly, yes, precisely so.))</i>

<p>
Well you have a choice of two very charismatic choices
for president! Do you vote for the vice president or
for political ``dynasty'' of the Bush’s. Looks like 6
months of watching paint dry if you ask me. I try not
to pay too much attention to your political process
but McCain came across as having something to say and
having a personality. This seems to be a no no these
days. The government tried very hard to stop Ken
Livingstone becoming mayor of London. Not sure I agree
with Ken’s politics but he is a character.

<p>
Have you heard that the film U571 is causing a furor
over here with even the Prime Minister condemning it.
In case you weren’t aware the film depicts the capture
of the Germans enigma decoder. The problem? Well the
film shows a US crew capturing the machine when the
crew was in fact British and the capture took place
before the US entered the war.  The families of those
involved weren’t best pleased either. This seems to be
a trend in Hollywood. Cameroon had to apologise to the
family of an officer of the Titanic when the film
falsely depicted him shooting Irish passengers in
steerage class.  I would have thought America has
produced enough heroes without purloining those of
other countries. Sad really that we now have a
separate Hollywood reality which the great unwashed
will treat as gospel. 
<i>((Yeah, this story had a lot of play over here too,
but basically most Americans ho-hummed it, which says
something about American insensitivity too.
Have you noticed how much we like to make Brits the
``evil villains'' in movies these days? - uncountable
number, virtually every action movie out right now.))</i>

<p>
If you ever get the chance read Richard Harris’ Enigma
which is, a fictional account, set at Bletchley Park
where the Enigma code breakers were based. Channel 4
produced a series of programmes called Station X about
the activities of the Code breakers at Bletchley. I
found it fascinating. I didn’t realise that Alan
Turing produced the first working computer. Turing was
sadly misused by the British government. He saved
thousands of lives and helped keep shipping lanes
open. After the war, because he was a homosexual, he
was treated as a security risk and persecuted because
he because Homosexuality was outlawed, Indeed as late
as the Seventies the work of Bletchley was unknown
because the Russians had captured German Enigma
machines and were using them. It wasn’t until the
seventies that someone spoke about it. The story is
fascinating and there is a book of the series.       

<p>
I haven’t listened to or bought much music lately. I
don’t seem to have the time at the moment. I could do
with a CD player in the car. Actually I can’t remember
the last new album I bought or concert I went to see!
I’m reading a lot of thrillers lately. I enjoyed
Joseph Kanon’s Los Alamos.  Is someone making a movie
of this? The topic is fascinating but the drawback
from Hollywood’s perspective is that the scientists
(certainly the leading ones) weren’t American.
<i>((There was a Los Alamos movie out a few years
back.
I'm not sure if it was based on this book or not.
They had a sub-plot going about the radiation leaks
and it really was very good, but I forgot the name
of the movie.
Someone will enlighten us.))</i>

<p>
I’ve spent a lot of the last 6 months looking round
churches. We have an amazing variety of them from
about 950 ad to the present day. They are jammed
packed with beautiful objects. I’m not a bit religious
but they are inspiring and take you to some beautiful
parts of the country, they tend to be in rural
locations. Its quite bizarre when you drive into some
small village and find a huge church virtually in the
middle of nowhere. Did you get the card by the way?   
<i>((Yes, indeedy I did.
Sorry, forgot to acknowledge it.
I had meant to publish the note, but the card didn't get 
to the right place.))</i>

<p>
What do you reckon to Hillary’s chances of getting
elected are? Over here the ``big'' political stories are
the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s condemnation of
elitism at Oxford and the Prime Minister becoming a
father. With astute political timing the baby arrived
in time to dominate the Sunday papers. The media is
obsessed by such trivialities.
<i>((The woman who got into Harvard, but not Oxford,
made huge news over here too.... mostly not pro-British
class system of course.
I think that Hillary had a better chance of beating Giuliani
than she does of beating Lazio (otherwise known as ``what's his
name").  
Polls are strongly showing interest in voting for Lazio even
by people who can't remember his name - in fact, especially
people who can't remember his name.
I had the race pegged as both having huge negatives, but when
it came down to it the Upstaters would not vote for the Mayor
of New York.
My parents were and are torn about that way - I like Hillary
much better than they do - and they still live in Upstate.
Even though Lazio is clearly a downstater, he doesn't appear
to have picked up NYC negative coattails yet.
The race will be to see if New Yorkers can learn enough about
Lazio to not like him too.
I, myself, don't get good vibes from him, but this could be
because I like Hillary - flawed and pathetic as she can be.))</i>

<p>
I write this the day that the European Football
championships start in Holland and Belgium. In case
you are unaware English football fans have a
reputation for being a bunch of thugs so the
authorities are expecting trouble. To be fair English
fans are no worse than say the Dutch or Germans but
their thugs stay at home whilst ours see it as their
``patriotic duty'' to ``defend their honour all over
Europe''. 
A month ago two English fans were murdered in Turkey
so we are wondering if some nutcase will be seeking
revenge. I expect that if two Turkish fans had been
murdered here we would have been banned hey ho.  You
don't seem to have these problems over in the states
do you.  There again your nut cases walk in to shops
with guns. We are a fun lot us humans don’t you think?
<i>((There was NO interest in the Football (Soccer)
championships here.
Sorry ;-)  You know how it is.))</i>

<p>
I’m assume you are aware of the problems in Sierra
Leone (?). There was a furor in the press when it was
revealed that British weapons were in the hands of
children supporting the government. A topical news
quiz quipped that 20% of all the world's children are
in Sierra Leone, the other 80% are safely at school in
the United States. Made me laugh. Just one last cheap
shot. I happened to see some wrestling on the telly
the other night (highly amusing very comical) but
everyone seemed to take it SO seriously when it so
obviously staged. I commented on this to a colleague
whose 8 year old loves it and he replied yeah it’s
designed for 8 year olds and Americans.

Wrestling is massively popular over here, but doesn't
do a thing for me.
Mostly, it is destroying football (US kind) as a spectator
sport, which I don't mind a bit.
The organizer of the WWF is putting together his own Football
league which will be wildly successful and further that move.
Again, though, I am not paying close attention.))</i>

<p>
Jim;

<p>
I have been reading intermittently about a new summer TV show 
``Survivor." Apparently its first episode was #1 for the week, beating 
``So you want to be a millionaire." I got to thinking about the concept of 
the show. 16 people on a deserted island. Each week they vote one person 
off. The last week there are three people on the island, one of whom 
will win a million dollars for being ``the last." All 16 originals come 
back and vote who is the winner.

<p>
Sounds like the way I'd like to play Diplomacy - there must be a winner. 
``Zero Sum" for sure. Maybe the next WorldMasters Dip tournament should 
play for a huge prize and be televised or web streamed.

<p>
However, we used to play a game, I forget the name and who's szines (I'm 
pretty sure John Schultz ran a game of it, probably Pete Gaughan and 
others) wherein the players were on a pirate ship or some such, and you 
got to have 5 (?) votes as to whom to throw overboard (maybe ``Overboard" 
was the name of the game) and when someone got a set number of votes - 
off they went. Winner was last onboard.
<i>((Yes, there is still a game of that running from Warren Goesle.))</i>

<p>
If we'd only known we could have a hit TV show from it. Dang, we missed 
millions by limiting our thinking to postal zines only. And then not 
adapting forward. Probably there are more games like that - how about 
Evil Empire Nuclear Yuppie? I'm sure you can think of some.

<p>
How about it <i>TAP</i> readers? Let's syndicate and pool and become the next 
IPO millionaires. What games could we adapt to a summer tv show?

<p>
<i>((Yeah!  
I love the Survivor! show.
We have a local RI player, Richard Hatch, who is playing the game JUST like
a good Diplomacy player.
The other week he started spearing fish for his group and made the three
player pact to get to the last three point.
I'd bet on those two women and him to make it there.
But if anyone stabs on the deal, that won't surprise me either.
So far, they have just been dumping the worthless riff-raff and 
incompetent schemers, as well as those not willing to scheme at all.
There are three or four more of those ``obvious'' losers to go
before they get down to about the final 8 or so.
If I am right then the Tagi Tribe should win the next couple of 
challenges.
Then things should really get GOOD!
So far, the players eliminated have been totally incompetent
at playing the real game here.
This has to be THE game for Diplomacy players, wouldn't we all
do pretty well - at least we would know what we SHOULD be doing.
For the future of the series,
they chickened out on going to Greenland next and also will have the next 
Survivor! in someplace warm.
They announced it, but I can't recall this instant where it is.
I think they want people to ``look good'' and not just all be bundled up.
The quote at the masthead is OF COURSE Niccolo Machiavelli from Chapter
14 of <b>The Prince</b>.
This szine's name is at least a quadruple entendre that I chose quite
intentionally.
The use of the term ``Prince'' in the title instead of ``Rasselas'' who
is the name of the Prince in Samuel Johnson's book about ``Abyssinia''
(well, that's not what it's about, but it's where it's set) is done
to call up references to Niccolo.
Then, of course, Abyssinia is populated by black people, so there is
a black prince connotation.
And there are yet two or three more levels of that in there.
To me, Diplomacy is all about those levels of intrigue.
The Diplomacy level intrigue in Survivor!
will increase as future players learn how to play.
From what I've seen so far, Richard Hatch is the only one with a complete
plan, starting from gaining weight BEFORE going to the island and the
way he has formed coalitions and used his homosexuality to his advantage.
Now that the Christian member of his team is gone, expect next week
those issues to pick up.
Big Brother is more voyeuristic, but I like the idea that the PLAYERS 
vote each other out, as they do on Survivor! as it makes the game more
internal.
This is stuff to watch!!!))</i>

<p>Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has stepped out of the sixth spot,
so we now need THREE more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've forgotten just this instant
who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Mostly a continuation of what we've already seen and not much
movement, eh??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA): You're not talking over anyone's head, bub, certainly
not mine. Oh, and your threat about Turkey ``going down"? Well, that may
be the case. However, Russia doesn't exactly look intimidating at the
moment. So just who is going to ``bring me down"?
You? 
Bring it on Buddy. I'm looking forward to it.

<p>
(ALI SCOTTI to ALI RANDALI ELIZ): May I suggest you use your razor-sharp wit 
and a screw-driver. From what I've seen in the past, you are very adept with 
both when your anger is riled.

<p>
(LONDON FEB15, 1903): The Prime Minister, John Beale, rose in Parliament 
and spoke, ``The government of the United Kingdom condemns the bellicose 
statements aimed at our nation by Sultan El Ahbid Ellis of Turkey. We 
warn Turkey that Britain will resolutely defend its dependencies against 
any Ottoman provocations."  

<p>
(BRATISLAVA FEB21, 1903): An Italian attack towards Galicia? 
A ski vacation for the troops in Bohemia? 
Is the king nuts?   

<p>
(ANKARA to ROME): Terry, are you still alive? Drop me a note sometime.

<p>
(ITALY to ALL): Tora! Tora! Tora!

<p>
(PRAGUE MAR 15, 1903): The Prague Daily Times has 
reported unsubstantiated claims of cannibalism this past winter in the 
Italian Army after their repulse from their attack on Galicia. The 
newspaper harshly condemned the Italian soldiers for wanton pillaging 
and the commandeering of food stockpiles. 

<p>
(RUSSIA (IN EXHILE) to 1998V TURKEY): I'm quite familiar with exactly what
``all the way dead" status is, sir. This really wasn't my death anyway.
It was a meager standby position which I managed to hold on to for a
couple of game years. I'm doing somewhat better in the game I started
myself (Fantastic Voyage). E-mail me sometime. Maybe we can arrange a
trip to YStone although with my new job, I don't have any vacation time
until late October. Sigh. I don't know about this ``real world" thing.

<p>
(SOMEWHERE IN THE `TREES' OF BOHEMIA APR1, 1903):
Surprisingly, the Italian army had survived the winter by foraging and 
by eating their nuts [not those nuts! - nuts in the forest - which, come 
to think of it were the Italians themselves]. The General was still 
cursing about those Turkish compasses, 
the needles of which continued to spin round and round. 
The Colonel suggested, ``Sir, perhaps, if we observe the transit of 
the sun we may determine which way is south and then head back." [This 
might have worked but the sky had been continuously overcast ever since 
the Italian army had arrived in Bohemia. One might even think that an 
omen of some kind but not our intrepid General]. ``Nonsense Colonel", 
replied the General, ``the King expects results and results we are going 
to get even if we have to stay right here." [How that would get results 
is anyone's guess]

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I like the new map better, so I am going to use it for awhile.
There are a few small errors in it, so players are reminded that this
is NOT the official game map.
Please confirm your orders against the regular one.
Dave Partridge is trying to help me edit the map, but does anyone 
have Harold's E-Mail? 
I'd like to see if I can get him to assist us.
Even though they are hard to read, having the place names on the map
helps immensely.
You guys will let me know if you see mapping errors....

<p>
1) Thanks to Randy Ellis for submitting unneeded standby orders.
Stan is still with us!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY-TURKEY): But, Scott.... I thought we were buds.
Let's work this out before things get carried away.

<p>
(RUSSIA-TURKEY): I hope all is going well for you in the Balkans!

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIANS MOVING SOUTH): You wouldn't be thinking of, ahem... 
moving any FURTHER SOUTH, would you? I did give you back SEV after a not so 
smart start. Does that count for anything? Could we talk this out?

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY AND RUSSIA): Sure, sure, sure....

<p>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY(WHOEVER YOU ARE)): Write to me and we'll discuss our 
situation...
<i>((Stan is back, safe and sound.... at least until you decide how
to deal with your ``situation''.))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY-WORLD): Sorry about that!

<p>
(ITALY-RUSSIA): Would you like to live in Rumania?

<p>
(RUSSIA-EUROPE): I am proposing a demilitarization of Galicia. That land and 
its peoples are peaceful and well-meaning. They do not deserve to face the 
ravages of a military occupation.

<p>
(GERMANY-RUSSIA): Oh, you naughty boy!

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) We're nearing the home stretch, this set of nukes for Spring should
set up the final maneuvering for the win.
Everyone, except possibly Heath, is still in the running!

<p>
2) Though Sara is revealed to be Harry Andruschak in real life,
I will keep this game as a ``Sara'' game.
It is an all-for-fun game anyway, so who cares WHAT you call yourself?

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SARA-ALL): For those of you who are curious as to how I am doing in games 
outside <i>TAP</i>, I should mention that I have just finished a game in Mike 
Lowrey's (s)zine <i>The Carolina Command And Commentary</i>, or <i>CCC</i> for short.  
If our esteemed GM doesn't mind, I should mention that subscriptions are 75 
cents per issue, sent to 6903 Kentucky Derby Drive, Charlotte, NC 28215 
mlowrey of charlotte.infi.net  and (704) 569-4269.  The winner was Frank Easton, 
playing Austria, with 20 SCs.  Pat Conlon (England) was second at 6 SCs, I 
(Germany) was third at 5 SCs, and Doug Hooper (Italy, and Austria's gullible 
toady) finished fourth and last with 3 SCs.   Austria had stabbed Italy from 
10 SCs to 3 SCs in the final two game years.  If you are interested in 
reading my endgame statement, just e-mail or write requesting a copy.

<p>
(FLORENCE - BIG SKIP): You seem to have more press items and lines credited
to you than anyone else in the entire <i>TAP</i>, plus in this Black Hole game.  So
how come I ain't never seen ya.  If you're so big?  Are you bigger than big
Vinnie?  Bigger than my big brudder?   Bigger than a breadbox?

<p>
(CALCUTTA-SARA): I can afford all the lawyers I need.  Copyright law is
fairly simple, given lawyers created it.  Precedence is 99% of possession.
There were not even the words ``astronomers" or ``physicists" when Calcutta
first used and copyrighted the term ``Black Hole."  Thanks to the English,
who are a country of laws and torts, as compared to the French who are a
country of tarts and haws, the copyright is from setting sun to rising sun.
And, just as on your Russian black hole where the sun never shines, the sun
never sets on our copyright.

<p>
(RICHARD-SARA): Only 4 nukes this time.  Please try to restrain yourself.  As
an airplane flier I read USA Today which keeps me coming across interesting
tidbits (other than the tidbits they serve as food).  Most recently they had
a list of the winners of each Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Game ever run in
the world.  Not a single country who was leading going into the final round
won.  There were many jumps from 4th and 5th to first, and one from 4 SCs
out.  Too bad for Heath.  But, you, as the Wicked Witch of the West would
say, but you my pretty, are another story.  You are in the most likely
position to end up the winner.  Congratulations on your clever machinations
to date.

<p>
(JOHN to MIKE): I don't have that national parks book anymore.  I do have
your Hustler's and Penthouse Letters.  Did you want them mailed back?
Remember, besides black holes, black press is allowed.  Maybe even black
Harleys.  Want to go see the kids and grandkids first, however.

<p>
(GamesMonger-SARA):  Your ``hard" copy will continue to come your way, since
you are simply irresistable.

<p>
(BOOB to GamesMonger): Really, now.....

<p>
(JODY-MIKE): Looks like you are quite the target this time.  If you had only
replied to my private emails.

<p>
(JOHN-MIKE):  Yep!
Still have the parts guide you sent me - and looking forward to using it, too.
Of course, I need to get my bike running first.
BTW - you're still in the lead.

<p>
(HEATH to RICHARD): Your big mouth has gotten you in the lead.  Now it's
time to blast your trap shut.

<p>
(JOHN-SARA): Thanks for the kind welcome home greetings.

<p>
(SARA-WORLD): Those of you who want to learn the truth about cats should 
visit 

<p>
 http://www.catsarefrommars.com

<p>
(BOOB-WORLD): This is actually a reasonably amusing web site.... for a few
minutes anyway... and I didn't see any evidence of cats at your house.
Don't tell me THAT was made up too??
Now THAT I could get upset about.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) A concession to Austria is proposed.
Please vote with your Spring orders, failure to vote does ensure that
it cannot pass. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY to GM): So, is there anything like a timely resonse to email, orders 
or builds? Or does that fall under ``untimely deadlines for TAP." ``get to 
them when you can," or ``I just don't give a shit anymore, I set my timeline 
by the postal service, which means you might get a reply by June of next 
year in the back of your copy of <i>TAP</i>, but good luck reading it because I 
wrote it on the train."

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): AH, insulting the GM to get some points to go after
other players, eh??
Well, go ahead, but couldn't you talk about something lighter first???

<p>
(ITALY P.S.): Boy! Could I have jinked the Penguins any worse?!?!? They completely 
fell apart in the the end of their series.
As far as the finals go, I could really care less. I don't like New Jersey 
and Dallas never should have gotten a team in the first place. The US has 
ben robbing Canada of her teams because of her weak economy, and I don't 
think it's right. Granted, Dallas got its team from Minnesota, but it 
doesn't change the fact that the North has been getting robbed blind by 
bigger markets south. You said you were rooting for Colorado this playoffs, 
and I really feel Colorado shouldn't have gotten the Quebec club. (that is if 
memory serves me correctly. I'm pretty drunk at the moment, and could have 
the wrong club. But I coulda swore it was Quebec that went to Colorado. IN 
any case, it was a Canadian Club.) 
<i>((Hey, lay off that whiskey!!))</i>
Canadian teams were the root of this 
whole sport, and I really like watching those older clubs have it out with 
their rivals. It's almost like baseball. I was really sorry to see Detroit 
leave their old park. One of the great things about baseball is all the 
history involved in it. And the same holds true with hockey. What happens 
when the ``green monster" gets abandoned for more seating and more dollars?
<i>((I dunno, they want to keep it in the new Boston park, but the
politics are not going well.
Now, we have some players who aren't feeling well.....))</i>

<p>
(ITALY to FARCE/FRANCE): OK buddy, here's the low-down. You try to say we 
are allies, and yet you insist on trying to force me to take centers that 
are, as you so nicely put in your last letter, ``completely undefendable." 
And you wonder why I don't trust you? Equal growth my ass... In my book, if 
you can't hold it, it doesn't count. So what is your plan exactly? Set me up 
as a fucking cash cow so you can solo in the end? To Hell with that one, my 
friend. I like you as a person, but a nice little war is in the wings...

<p>
(F to G): Jim are you for real??  PUH-leeeeze.  I hate it when Diplomacy 
players whine like a stuck pig about being lied to.  You prostituted yourself 
to that god in the first year as I recall. Don't get religion on me yet big 
boy.  You can still walk the streets for a few more nights.  Now get out 
there and get paid.  Beeeeeeeee ach.

<p>
(F to T): Why are you always right?  Why oh lord why???

<p>
(F to A): SEEEEEvo, mu lar, BI teeee von ZU, SACKS MON reeexe.  

<p>
(SCOTT to BARNO):  Nicely done Barno, you bastard.... I always knew there was 
I reason I liked you.... LOL!!

<p>
(On the border between Moscow and Warsaw):
``Damn! Why do we always get stuck with this kind of duty?
Because it is our duty...''
``Our duty?
I have been serving the Czar for 5 yrs. now and all I have to show 
for it is this scar on my cheek."
Both men had seen a lot.
The Russian army had been pushed back early in the 
war  where it had taken up a defensive position against the Austrians.
The two of them were trained in various skills and at present they were engaged in 
observing the enemy based in Warsaw.
``Ah, it is the 15th Lancers.''
``The 15th. Lancers?''
``Yes my friend.
They have moved into that great city that should be ours.
What do you think the pigs will do?
I do-not ....wait...do you here that?
Yes...Ah!..I't is that damn song..."
Through the quiet of the evening a familiar tune drifted over to the men 
shivering in the snow.
It grew louder...``Sit on my face if you really love me 
and tell me ...."
``Where did it originate from,why do they sing it in such earnest?''
``It comes from the British.
I think that their new commander Mr.Flashman 
taught it to them and now they embrace it like a cheep whore...``
``Oh...I think we had better report this back to Moscow and then take a train 
to China.''
``China?..''
``Yes.
It will be safe there..."      

<p>
(IN ROME): Speedicut was pissed. The 20 year old port he was sipping at 
helped calm him somewhat, but even that fine concoction, proof that there is 
a God and that he loves us, could not remove the edge that anger put on his 
mind. The 20 year old vixen he had been galloping with earlier (a parting 
gift from Flashman) didn't help much either.
   
<p>
The French people, in general, couldn't care less for their southern 
neighbors, and their most beloved Ambassador Morris was holding true to 
French ways.
   
<p>
``What a fucking prick..." Speedicut summoned his swiftest carriers, and 
sent out the the WORD. This was going to be the hardest decision he would 
ever have to make. The lives of the young people of Italy were riding on the 
WORD he was sending far and wide. Hesitantly, Speedicut made his Royal mark 
on the letters and sent them.
   
<p>
More Port flowed and more women were summoned, but he couldn't quite 
shake that sad feeling deep inside.
   
<p>
The world was about to become a much meaner place.
<i>((Some would say that it already has..... remember everyone the House
Rules that you MUST insult the GM at least as much as you insult any other
player.
I demand to join in the fun at least as much as any of you.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Gee, lots of action in this game.
Still not clear how it all will shake out.....
and note Drew James' new E-Mail address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to WORLD): Pretty clear that there is no way to stop A/G unless 
we all work together. Yes, yes, I know I wasn't exactly your best friend 
two seasons ago, but that was then and this is now.

<p>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND): No, I'm not laughing.  And I have the perspective to
know I may be outlasted by the Brit... but I do know I intend to have some
fun after squeaking out of that little Iberian trap.  

<p>
(ENGLAND to AUSTRIA): Seems to me that you will be fighting hard for 
every dot you have to pull out of I/R/T, while your new friend will be 
ripping through my home islands.  Might want to watch your back and 
think about the long term.  There is clear evidence that the German is 
willing to stab his friends.

<p>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND): Hey, we went nearly 5 years!  In Diplomacy, or even in
diplomacy, that IS forever!
<i>((Indeed.... I could NEVER have held out THAT long....))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY to TURKEY): Yeah, it's probably too late to redeem the coupons.  Had
we actually been serious about saving you we'd have stopped picking on
France long ago and done it.  Hopefully that won't dampen your enthusiasm
for submitting press here.  We need your baseball and hockey insights.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Ok, I have now heard your predictions.  Let's pull it all out
in October and see what happened.  
<i>((Other than Bonds having another monster season, I don't seem to have
picked the Giants right.... I'm comfortable with all of them at this point
though.
I'm actually even comfortable with the Giants pick, but it is certainly
uncertain ;-) right now.))</i>
I have one more for you:  the first
manager to be fired for non-performance will be Houston's.  Philadelphia's
will be a close second.
<i>((You mean that you think Bobby Valentine makes it to the end of the
season???
I actually think Dierker won't be fired.  
Top management dealt him this hand, so if they do fire him they should fire
themselves first.))</i>

<p>
(JAMES to GM): I agree with you (or at least what I think you think) 
about Bobby Knight.  He is a disgrace to basketball and I would hate him 
even if Keith Smart had missed the jump shot in 1987 vs Syracuse.  
Compare the treatment of Sprewell to Knight.  Sprewell lost, what, 
millions, while Bobby was severely scolded and warned.  Given that Bobby 
is supposed to be an adult in charge of minors, I would venture to say 
that his offense is much much worse.  Why does any high school 
basketball player go to Indiana?  I'll never understand it. I know that 
Div I college basketball is about winning and little else, but there has 
to be a line somewhere.  The NCAA routinely screws the players for minor 
offenses (remember Barkley), but allows head cases like Knight to do 
whatever they want.  Something is really wrong here.
<i>((I'm with you on this, but it is worth noting that most of the 
players who manage to stick with Knight really swear by him (not at
him) and seem to appreciate how hard he pushed them.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FIELD to ALICE):  He's a Maniac, not a Mainiac!  There's a difference between
Maine and New Hampshuh.

<p>
(ALICE - BRIT PACK): No, that's a breaking OUT bonus!  Way to go John!

<p>
(RABBIT - (DOG) PACK):  Catch me if you can!

<p>
(RABBIT - HARE):  Please pass some mushroom up front.  The team needs a
boost.

<p>
(BOOB to RABBIT): I would think that would slow you WAYYYY down!

<p>
(TURTLE - RABBIT):  Keep your feets to yourselfs.

<p>
(HARE - HATTER):  You're still giving off bad fumes!

<p>
(BUHRT - GM): Well, that should be about it for ole Buhrt.  If March
Hare and War take it easy then ah'll drag it out a bit, elsewise
it's to the pub for this old codger.

<p>
(BOOB - BUHRT): Looks like you hang on for at least awhile.
Logie-Baird and Alfred seem to have miscalculated and given you
a few replenishment points.

<p>
(RABBIT - FIELD):  Thanks just the same; think I'll catch my breath.

<p>
(WHITE RABBIT - DARRELL):  You got more wind than your buddy Burt.

<p>
(MANIACS to ALICE):  Yeah, I'm hanging in there.  I'm a solid 4th in
points, but I make up for it by being 4th in cards!

<p>
(TFWS-ALICE): I've already had my victory - all my losses are victories
from now on.

<p>
(MOCK TURTLE - DARRELL):  You going out with that Mark character?

<p>
(MAD HATTER - DARRELL):  He means that other Darrell.

<p>
(TFWS-SHAKESPEARE): OK - I hit 45 for you - now hit 56 for me.

<p>
(BOOB-TFWS): He didn't, but one of those Darrell's did....
must have been the other Darrell.

<p>
(SIR ISAAC NEWTON): If Mark does not break away this time I'll eat that apple 
that just fell on my head.

<p>
(MARK to LUKE):  This race sure has gotten slower!

<p>
(BOOB to MARK): It certainly did!!

<p>
(TFWS-BRIT PACK): Like I said, I've already received my Breaking Away bonus.
It's called freedom.
Never take it for granted - it's a wondrous thing.

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Lying in the dirt, looking up at the twinkling stars;
Struggle in the darkness, with the buttons on my shirt;
This is meant to be a painkiller, but it's so good it hurts.''
In some connections that will make sense above and below.... this is from 
``Fantastic Voyage'' off of the album <i>So Good It Hurts</i>.

<p>
(EGYPT-TURKEY): The betrayer himself becomes betrayed!
Enjoy the moment!

<p>
(A GHOST FROM THE PAST):
Infidels!!! Only now can I haunt you!
You have so throughly kicked my Nation's ass that it has taken me this long 
to climb back up from the lowest level of Hell in order to spit and curse you all!!! 
May you drown in the dung of a thousand camels who have the runs!!!

<p>
(EGYPT to THE FEDERATION COUNCIL): Red alert, we are under attack, warp drive
has failed, Impulse is functional, shields are up and holding for 
now, but without help....

<p>
(FEDERATION COUNCIL to EGYPT): Does the Kobyashi Maru scenario mean anything
to you?

<p>
(UKRAINE - &gt;  1998V TURKEY): We are only happy that we were able to participate
in enlightening our departed colleague.  We hope that while the process
will be a slower one, the Caliph of Egypt can reap the same eventual 
rewards as we assist him in following the path taken by the revered Sultan.
<i>((Is that with or without the runs....))</i>

<p>
(ROME-ALL): The Gooey will cover the world!  It is like an amorphous blob 
which nobody can stop.

<p>
(BOOB to ALL): Ah, it's with..... I should have known, with the BlackHearted
in the game....

<p>
(EGYPT-SPAIN): When Uncle Chip comes to visit, please don't show him the
current map.
He taught me everything I know, looking at the map might embarrass him.

<p>
(BRITAIN-ALL): What to do?  What to do??

<p>
(BOOB-BRITAIN): Indeed.

<p>
(EGYPT-ITALY): Your maneuvers in TYS, ION, and MAL have me confused.
Are you saying that we are no longer allies?

<p>
(ITALY to SPA AND EGY): Lock up your daughters and bring in your garbage
cans; I'm southward bound, baby!

<p>
(EGYPT-GERMANY): It occurs to me that you are the one player on the
board I've not contacted yet.
If you decide to make plans to visit the Vatican, I'd be willing to help
coordinate your reservations.

<p>
(EGYPT-ITALY): I appreciate your integrity in refusing to return my call
just to lie to me.
I, on the other hand, would be more than willing to call you back to lie
to you!

<p>
(ERIC-JIM): I have found a new sense of purpose to live in this game.  I am
a black cat with nine lives who comes back to stab and stab some more. 
My thirst is insatiable.   

<p>
(JIM-BOB to ERIC): I'm with you laughing all the way.... drink of the 
sweet, dark delights!

<p>
(EGYPT to UKRAINE): Help!

<p>
(JESUS to THE APOSTLE PETER): He who lives by the sword....

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Ah, hum.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(H - T): Door is open.

<p>
(RUSSIA to BOARD):  We ought to be ashamed of ourselves.  If the best
thing about the press for this game is this (admittedly entertaining)
crap from Southpark, shouldn't we all just shoot ourselves?  Lock and
load,pals ...

<p>
(BOOB to RUSSIA): Yeah, lock and load!!

<p>
(WILLIAMS to BURGESS): I shouldn't complain overmuch ... it beats the
hell out of your stuff.

<p>
(BURGESS to WILLIAMS): Really, let's call in a neutral observer....

<p>
(SOCRATES to WILLIAMS):  Not to mention yours, pal.

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY):  No, really, I mean it - we're really working
together.  Trust me.  Seriously.  Oh, shit ... never mind.

<p>
(TSAR to KURTUGAWA OZOSAN):  Okay, you got the freakin' dot you so
desperately needed to stab me for.  NOW, will you work with the Frog to
crack the H/B line?  If you opt not to, this game is quickly headed for
a five way.  (To Himself:  Hmm, at least that would END this ghoddamn
thing ... let's not rush to judgement here against the five-way ... )

<p>
(RUSSIA to BRIT): Your days are numbered.  You're gone in three years. 
Count on it.

<p>
(MOSCOW to BORNEO): Take him down, Rick, now's the time!

<p>
(TSAR to GM): Can I be excused to go have a life now?

<p>
(BOOB to TSAR): NO!  You are sentenced to remain here for the remained of
your natural life, and perhaps beyond if you are not careful!
Seriously, I didn't feel like it would be fair to impose a shorter conclusion.
Concessions always are possible.
