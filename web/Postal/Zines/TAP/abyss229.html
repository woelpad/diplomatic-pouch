<p><br><p><br>A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing
in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After about an
hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse.
``But why?" they asked, as they moved off. ``Because," he said, ``I can't
stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."
Anon. - Dippers would never do that, would they???

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I have added to the Web Page an Adobe Acrobat pdf version of Jim Meinel's
Encyclopedia of Postal Diplomacy Zines, ca. 1992, that covers primarily
US postal Diplomacy szines from the dawning of the Boardman era to 1992.
You may find it at:

Jim Meinel's E-Mail address is: meinel of alaska.net and his postal address is:
12821 Plymouth Circle, Anchorage, AK  99516  USA if you want to make comments
to him about it.  
He is not likely to do an update, but this is still an important historical
resource that I wanted to make available on the Web.
I decided to use PDF format to retain all of the original design features
(it is nearly 2000K in size), including some very flowery engraved lettering.
In testing the file, I had a small amount of trouble in reading it (which might
be blips in my browser) when opening it directly, but in saving it back and 
forth to disk, it worked fine.
I'd appreciate anyone else letting me know if they have problems.
Stephen Agar and I have been having some preliminary discussions around moving
some things around in the Postal section of the Pouch, so eventually this document
may move to a more prominent position, but at the moment, I feel that I only
have the right to alter TAP's directory.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE WILL BE MARCH 6TH, 2000</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends (that will be Modern
with the Wing rule).
Please consider joining Mark Kinney's regular Diplomacy
game start if you want to get going in one.
Let's help Mark get at least ONE regular Diplomacy gamestart.
We have to have it in us......
I also have a game opening with Eric Ozog as GM.
Please see Mark Kinney's note in the Diplomacy section of the letter
column, and Eric's note at the head of the Games Section below.
Someday I might decide to add Page numbers, but I sincerely doubt it,
hyork, hyork, hyork..... ugly layout and proud of it.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR BRENTON VER PLOEG AND....</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Brenton Ver Ploeg has been found.
This actually was a search with a twist.  
I actually am offering up TWO $50 rewards.
The first reward was finding for Brenton - that goes to Pete
Gaughan, which he will use to get some of his szine collection into
the Bowling Green Diplomacy Archives.
The second is for resolving a certain mystery that currently exists
in our hobby for which Brenton is particularly well qualified to solve.
I have shared with Brenton ALL of the information I currently have on this
mystery and he will thus have the leg up to get the second $50 reward.
I won't be announcing another person to search for until Issue #235
while we allow time to search this mystery.
Feel free to assist Brenton or others to solve it.
I shall be saying nothing more about it.

<p>
Or spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
I can't believe Garret isn't on the Internet somewhere these days
for example.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton would love to find the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>

<p>
``Finding" me?  Jeez, even the most basic of search engines would find
bnvpa.com, so I have no idea where the mystery lies.  I have no doubt,
however, that the `other' mystery is the fabled saga of Judy Winsome, but
that too has been written up by Doug Beyerlein (who I heard from just a few
months ago).

<p>
Anyway, I'll email him, <i>((meaning me))</i>
or you may send this message on yourself
(since I won't get to it for a while).  
You're welcome to the big bucks,
since I haven't heard from anyone else.

musings on legal issues.
Then I got something directly from Brenton as well.))</i>

<p>
Now I can't say that the Judy Winsome effort started as anything more
than whimsical, but the woman fronting for Lucas turned out to be a charmer
(and if you find him, I'd like to know if he has a current address for her
for Christmas card purposes) so there were collateral benefits.

<p>
My team, The Seven Most Evil Men in the World, was
in the lead for a couple of game years. That was certainly
fun, although it's a bit unnerving to have a giant target
painted on your back.

<p>
The quality of play and quality of GMing
has been mixed. I've been lucky (?) enough to have
three top-ranked players in my game, but some games
have been distorted by incompetent players.

<p>
There's been some discussion on the conference
board about what to do differently next year. Will I
play again? Maybe, although I really don't have
time for active Diplomacy games these days.

<p>
World Masters Tournament:  As GM of a game which I think has voted 
itself into a draw and a player in one game, I think the play has been quite 
variable.  No further comments until it is all over.  Two specific comments 
for you if you are going to be more involved next time.  I think that the 49 
players going into the semi-finals should be the seven best players of each 
country and once you choose a country at the beginning of the tourney you 
must remain that country throughout.  Secondly, now that I have had draw 
proposals and votes, the rules are not specific enough.
<i>((Yes, I think that is a good idea - choosing a country and following
it through the tournament.
I chose Austria as a ``sacrifice'' for my team, but playing for ``best
Austria'' would have changed the equation.
The rules and the GM control problems are understandable, but overall
caused the biggest problems.))</i>

<p>
WorldMasters99:
Me being the captain of the Swedish National Stabbers (not playing just
metadipping) and GM of your England Steve Emmert and also acting in the
Tournament Directing Committee.
<i>((Ah, well, Steve is having an interesting game, isn't he....
it could be nearly over by the time you all read this.... but I'll
let Steve tell the story if he likes.))</i>
The team is mainly a ``f2f players trying email'' team, I wanted that as a
test to see what we could do.
I quickly gathered some of the best around, three from the final table
at WDC 99 in Namur, Christian Dreyer the current WDC Champ, me second
and Niklas Perez seventh and last on the final table. I also got Simon
Magnusson (reserve player, follow all the games we are in) fourth over
all, spiced things up with a old f2f player Joel Gr&#246;nberg and three new
kids on the block: David Luna, Torbj&#246;rn Rander, and Aron Ambrosiani. 

<p>
As expected there have been problems adopting to email play but we are
learning and currently at place 26 with some chances of hitting top 10.
We have at the moment a 9 sc Germany, 12 sc Austria, 10 sc Russia, 8 sc
Turkey, 6 sc Italy (Dreyer playing between a huge E and T), F and E out.
<i>((We have been a bit more of a boom/bust team, with four players
out, one finished with a board topper and the two other players (including
Steve) currently topping their boards.
We have an outside chance at the Top 10 ourselves.))</i>

<p>
We have all played with the system C-Diplo several times and know it
inside-out. It's surprising that so many players don't understand the
basic idea and concept of C-Diplo, that's one of the reasons for the
amount of solos in the tournament. When used f2f in Europe with players
with some experience, there is almost always a tight board: fun, exciting
and nerve wrecking to the end, I guess we will see that in round two.
<i>((Begrudgingly, I admit that you are probably right about that.
I still don't like it.))</i>

<p>
As a acting TDC member I have had some serious decisions to make and have
been surprised more than once, holy things in Europe might not be so
holy in USA and vice versa, I am the only TDC member outside USA. As an
example I have <i>never</i> heard about rolling back a turn before this
tournament. 
<i>((Don't complain about that, no one in the USA had ever heard of
such a thing before either, and we are not pleased about it!!))</i>

<p>
Some work has to be done to get the concept more workable
for next time but I do think that the next tournament will be ``better".
If you don't want to play as a player think about being a captain,
coordinate the team and talk to the other teams. It takes as much time
you have and want and it's fun.
<i>((Yeah, but you don't want to let your teammates down.
To me the time commitments at the speed this tournament goes
are the main problem, no matter what role you have.
I look forward to this being over and I can zen back into 
my preferred lifestyle!))</i>
And it's definitely better for the team, even if I haven't played in any
game I have done something for the team and I think we would have done
worse with me playing:-)

Bless yer honest GM heart.  There are some disadvantages to the distance of
my general's map room from you at H.Q., although Email solves a lot of the
problems involved in living at the asshole end of the planet.  Actually the
distance has it's advantages, it keeps most of the mad and dangerous
riff-raff out of reach.

<p>
Although we are having a steady influx of boat people from Indonesia and
other Asian countries, similar to your influx of Hatiians and Cubans.
All very reminiscent of the Goths, Vandals etc who infiltrated the Roman
Empire. In that case the unwashed, illiterate Northeners dragged the Empire
down into barbarism. But Australia is getting the hard-working Chinese who
are paying plane or boat fares to get here illegally.  Probably a better
selection method than the Immigration bureaucrats could devise.
<i>((There is a relatively new book called ``Catastrophe'' that asserts
that a massive volcano eruption in the Indonesian part of the world indirectly
led to the Goth/Vandal invasions and collapse of the Roman Empire.
It's a pretty neat book that makes it's argument well.
Funny you should describe all that the way you do, did you read the book???))</i>

What news of Berry Renken?  He is such a crafty Diplomat, but quite
unworldly.  I had to nag him into asking for expenses. Especially as he
doesn't work; I don't know why and don't like to ask.  I think I introduced
him to <i>TAP</i> but I wouldn't swear to it.  I was wondering if we could all do
ourselves a favour by contributing to a new computer for him? All very well
for a comfortably placed old fart like me to suggest $50-$100 dollars I
suppose, but probably way beyond the finances of the younger set. You have
your finger on the pulse of the <i>TAP</i> group.  I could suggest it to
Bluesmobile people. Do you think we could drum up 3-4 thousand dollars? 
Perhaps each what he can afford? It is a lot to ask I suppose.

<p>Hey, I almost forgot!!! 
Comments on the 1999 year in music?
The Grammy Awards (which don't interest me much ordinarily) reminded me that I

I thought of it, of course, because Susan Tedeschi was nominated as ``Best New

<p>
The tape thing is still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll find a commercial service to copy them for me.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.

<p>
To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
a free tape).
Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
That showed the value of getting in early!!
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson ($5),
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
Round 2 E-Mail voters were Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch.
Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee, and Andy York.
Round 5 voters were Mark Larzelere, Al Tabor, Jody McCullough, and that's it.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; something from the B-52's;
the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

Just received your zine TAP 227 and 228 in the mail, thanks.
Having read a few old issues
(issues:125,127-131,133,135,140-142,162,165,167) of the zine given to

Interesting discussion.
It got me thinking about what my tape would include. It's hard to pick a
few winners among many but I have some.
I used to listen a lot to Joy Division and have them all in my
collection. To start of a party with my closest friends ``Warsaw'' is one
song I could use, my generation was during the late teens when they was
on, other Joy Division songs I like include ``Atmosphere'' and ``No Love Lost.''
<i>((Yes, ``Atmosphere'' is one of my favorites too, also ``Shadowplay'',
which was a famous favorite in early 1980's Dip circles.
I left this next paragraph pretty much in the stream of consciousness
in which it was written.
WOW!
I was impressed, as what amounts to poetry trips out of your keyboard.
Eoghan Barry is joining the szine (for those of you who know him) and
this may inspire Eoghan, who writes some of the best music commentary
in this style I've ever read.))</i>

<p>
But no Joy Division on my tape.
This is not a party record really just some great music.
Tom Waits, Franks Wild Years and the song Temptation, I always get a
shivering spine when listening to this one.
Spiritualized, Royal Albert Hall and the song Come Together, when the
guitars flow over me  in this tune I always end up with a smile on my
lips.
My Bloody Valentine, Loveless and the song When you sleep, independent
music for the masses.
Galaxy 500, The portable Galaxy 550 and the song Fourth of July, this
one is for the moment of sadness in anyone's life.
The Doors, Hello I love you and People are strange (they both are on
Greatest Hits as an example), a true hero with a voice I love.
Codeine, Barely Real and the song realize, the title of the album says
it all.
Nick Drake, an introduction to Nick Drake and the tune Time of no Reply,
great song with one of the greatest ever.
Union Carbide Productions, In the air tonight, back on track with some
of the most Rocken Rollish you can hear, try the song Ring My Bell and
turn the volume UPP don't have your mother nearby, she will start to
doubt, always gets me going when in a dull mood.
The Velvet Underground, White Light/White Heat, get cooled down with
some nice music and put on the 17:27 long Sister Ray
Let's keep it calm for a moment with Lamchop, How I quit smoking and the
song The Man who loved beer, feel the legs start to hit the floor, drink
up your beer and settle for a long drink.
Portishead, roseland nyc live, ok it's the whole album but we pick one
song and why not the first Humming, all of a sudden all people on the
party will sing a long after the first listening and after the fourth or
fifth rewinding we can go on with.
Nick Cave &amp; the bad seeds, Live Seeds and the song Tupelo, it's
important that you get the right version it should be this live record.
Now the party is going again an we put on Spaceman 3, Taking drugs to
make music to take drugs to and the song Losing Touch with my Mind, and
when your mind is lost you wake up to a classic, Led Zeppelin and
Communication Breakdown the most played song during last new year on the
party I was attending with a crescendo at midnight when the speakers
broke due to playing it too loud.
By now the first party depression should happen, someone needs Hank
Williams and the song I'm so lonesome I could cry
The last effort before the party turns gutter-crawling-home we start off
with Neil Young, Mirrorball and the song Peace and Love, Great listening and
stops people from talking during the party.
The next record is The John Spencers Blues Explosion, Experimental
Remixes Extended Playing lo-fi demonstrational and the song Greyhound part
1, should get some dancing in the corners near the big palm tree slowly
gaining momentum with Mc Solar, Prose Combat and Nouveau Western, by now
even the computer wiz from your company should be on his feet if not
let him listen to Afro Cuban All Stars, A Toda Cuba le Gusta and the
song Amor Verdadero.
Keep the thing rolling with Iggy Pop, Lust for life and The Passenger
this should be the first clue for the dancers that it's soon to be over.
By now all you want to do is sleep and Tindersticks, Donkeys 92-97 and
the song Tiny Tears should help you.
You wake up and realize that some are still hanging around, to get them
on their way the tape has as a last song John Coltrane, The Major Works
Of John Coltrane and Ascension- Edition II with a playing time of 40:31
should do it, 5 musicians playing saxophone at the same time help a lot.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>I have no regular Diplomacy game openings, but am actively recruiting
players for Mark Kinney so he can get his szine restarted.
To assist him, I have agreed to join his game.  
See the note in the Dip Hobby section above.

<p>
Also, from Eric Ozog:
``What do you say to me running Bernie Oaklyn's Air-Sea Diplomacy variant
as a subzine in <i>TAP</i>? The Maricopa game is going to wind up pretty soon,
and I'd still like to GM. I fit the profile: I'm a `not as young as I
used to be somewhat old-timer burned-out dip-deadwood daddy,' so GMing a
single game (preferably variant) in an orphanage zine (like <i>TAP</i>) of HOFs
(Hobby Old Farts) seems to be the fashionable thing to do these days.  It
might help forestall alzheimer's, if anything.  If you remember, Air-Sea
is the variant Uncle Bernie designed, based on the standard map except it
adds airplanes and submarines.  Maybe even Bernie would play.  I just
need to clean up the rules a little bit and would like to run it as an
email game, and you can print it in your zine.  You can make the
announcement in the next issue of <i>TAP</i> if you'd like, and shortly I'll
edit the rules and send them to you for publication.  What do you think?''
GO FOR IT, ERIC.
You know that as one of my originals, you only have to ask.
Send requests to join this game either to me or to Eric.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
Chris Lockheardt has taken the sixth spot.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this very soon,
we now need only TWO more players.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
Then, for NON-Diplomacy oriented types.
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.  
If you are interested, contact Stephen Agar at stephen of spoff.demon.co.uk
who still heads up <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> postal section or
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p>
1) Gee, lots of people wanting to support England doing things that he
didn't (or couldn't) do.... and two centers left neutral that no one
even TRIED to take.
Interesting start.
Let's go for some press now.

<p>
2) John Biehl and Buddy Tretick have new E-Mail addresses. 
Note them above.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(OTTOMAN EMPIRE to WORLD): The Sultan apologizes for his diplomatic inactivity
as of late. He has sent emissaries to all relevant nations and wishes peace
with all but the invaders from the North. Regarding the Russian invaders,
the Sultan was quoted, ``The infidel dogs will soon be fed their own
intestines". A Turkish 3rd and 4th division have been recruited in Anatolia
to deal with the marauders.

<p>
(CONSTANTINOPLE to VIENNA): Well done!

<p>
(VIENNA): NOW, is anyone willing to talk HONESTLY with Austria?

<p>
(DEC 31, 1901 - SOMEWHERE AT SEA): ``Damn,'' swore Captain Hood as he
ordered down periscope, ``that French Battleship has disappeared.''
What was he to do now?
If the mission was not a success his career would be in ruins and
a coveted Rear Admiral's bars would not be his.

<p>
(CONSTANTINOPLE to ROME): Interesting; very interesting...

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) There I go trying to change a supply center ownership abbreviation
and get myself off track.
France actually only has 3 builds since I forgot to remove ownership
of Papal States from him as Austria took it.
I used ``pps'' for the abbreviation there, but ``pap'' for it in France's
list, which is why I didn't catch it.
Thanks for the heads up on this.
Also, England could also retreat A Colombia-Amazon, and he chose to do
just that.
Especially with retreat options, you will do well to check me.

<p>
2) I've also cleaned up a few minor issues in the Supply Center Chart
and added what might be the complete list of remaining neutrals.
Thanks to Robert Stimmel for giving me a hand!!
Check if I have any more confusing or repetitive abbreviations there.
I am going to keep listing the movements with full names to make it
possible for readers following the game to tell what is happening.

<p>
3) Sean O'Donnell takes over permanently as the Dutch and I have
two more standbys, thank you!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-BOARD): Hope no one minds.

<p>
(OTTO-MOS): All that being true, would not it have made
more sense for you to tell me to take it?

I presume that means something.....))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Guess what, Scott is back in Yellowstone country.... this time
for real.
But he's still sleeping on a buddy's couch and isn't especially settled.
I think he does have access to the hotmail account now, so you can try
to reach him that way, as well as by post.
For this game, everyone has until April 1 to get things to me.
The default retreat for Scott will be to Albania, not OTB, if he
doesn't manage to get in touch with me before March 11, since
there is only one retreat choice and this is a summer season.
Stan obviously needs to let me know what he is doing, since he 
has more choices.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JOHN-BOOB): As long as seasons are split, there's enough time,
but more is always nice.
<i>((I will get the szine out earlier this time and we'll
see how that does at keeping us on track.
It wouldn't surprise me if Jim got the szine before people
on the West Coast of the US the way things have been going
lately.))</i> 

<p>
(MOSCOW-LONDON): I'm perfectly willing to forget your visit to
St. Petersburg.
No real harm done.

<p>
(MOSCOW-PARIS): Don't bend to Germany's diplomatic pressure.
Do whatever you want in the West, the Teutons will be no threat
to your position.

<p>
(F-I): Maybe less than 7 years.
<i>((Huh?))</i>

<p>
(MOSCOW-BERLIN): It's a shame it's had to come to this.
Frankly, I like central powers as allies but I don't much
appreciate them as enemies.
I CERTAINLY don't want everyone drinking Prussian rum all over Europe.
(Especially the French.... who knows what could happen to them if you
gave them real liquor.)

<p>
(ITALY-GERMANY): Why, thank you - I'm sure all will be fine.

<p>
(MOSCOW-VIENNA): My apologies for being unable to help you defend
yourself but it was Germany's fault.

<p>
(ITALY-RUSSIA): Naah, I'm not interested in you, Bubba.

<p>
(MOSCOW-ANKARA/PARIS/ROME): The Mediterranean's wide open.
<i>((Well, not WIDE open. . . . ))</i>
Especially you, Turkey, you've got a lot to gain.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) For next year, we keep rotating and Sara is Austria, John is England,
Heath is France, Mike is Germany, Sandy is Italy, Jody is Russia 
(remember that you only get four nukes), and Richard is Turkey.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JOHN-WORLD): So, who's top doggy at the end of this turn?
Who gets to get toasted?
<i>((Still awfully tight, with Sandy and Mike tied for the
top spot.
Even MIA Heath is in striking distance.))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA-SARA): See my response supporting your anti-circumcision press 
elsewhere.  Keep up the good work on raising consciousness.
   
<p>
(SARA): Army Armenia burns GM in effigy.

<p>
(RUSSIA-MANIAC FOR PIAZZA AND MOBIOUS PRESCIENCE BARNO): The web-site 
seems to show that both you and Dr. Laura are circumcised - of course, I had 
to digitally enhance her image!

<p>
(RICHARD): Army Warsaw picks up detente nuke and throws it at Prussia.

<p>
(JODY - SANDY): My nukes will see you next Spring.

<p>
(FLEET PIC-ENG-WAL-LVP-CLY-EDI-YOR-LON-ENG-BEL):  Wanna see me do it
counterclockwise?

<p>
(SAME FLEET to BRITISH):  Wanna see me do it anticlockwise?

<p>
(SAME FLEET to GAELIC):  Wanna see me do it widdershins?
<i>((No matter WHICH way you do it, it still bounces.....))</i>

<p>
(JOHN-JODY): Guess it's too much to hope that you didn't notice that I did
you harm?

<p>
(JODY - JOHN): Whether or not my move worked, I'm willing to call it even.

<p>
(JOHN-JODY): I didn't mind- even though I blew you to smithereens.
Trieste is the least I could do - assuming, of course, that you can
hang on to it.

<p>
(JOHN-MIKE): Nuke them into oblivion!!
They've done nothing for me lately.

<p>
(RUSSIA-JOHN): Any of the mail reading censors responding to our bombing 
the Indiana St. Prison?

1) And SUCH an interesting position, that I typed in one of
Austria's orders wrong, the order is reported above for the
record, though the support was cut, so there were no changes
in final unit positions.

<p>
Fascinating game-end statements last time.  I remained unaware of the plot
against me on turn one and tip my hat to the organiser.  It puzzled me at the
time, I must admit, but I just put it down to it being in a game full of
beginners.

<p>
I didn't keep notes so my recollections of the game are not as accurate as
some of the other players.  I do recall forgetting which house rules we were
playing to and letting the leader get away (I was expecting him to get just
the one breaking away bonus - my fault for not being organised).  As someone
pointed out last issue I destroyed a reasonable position by setting off too
late to try and peg the leader back, but by that stage I had projected that I
was unlikely to win with conservative play and so gambled on ``making something
happen".  Something did happen - I got buried!  Still, even for a Brit, second
place is for nancy-boys, it was shit or bust for me.

<p>
I thoroughly enjoyed the game and hope the other players did too.  If anyone
wants to buy a copy they can get in touch with me or Jim and we'll sort out
any currency problems.  I can't deny that the game is mostly tactical but even
though I say so myself it is fun, usually requires agonising decisions each
turn (face to face ordering of movement is sequential, not simultaneous) and
replicates the sport in such an uncanny way that it is a pity this came about
purely by accident rather than the genius of the game designer.

<p>
I do have another game playable by post or face to face (2 hours length),
called Office Politics, but that's a game of empire building, negotiation,
double-dealing, backstabbing and perfidy - I don't suppose anyone in TAP's
readership would find that sort of game interesting, would they?  I could be
persuaded to run it if Jim is agreeable and enough players want to sign up
(minimum 4 needed).

1) I think John owes a copy of Breaking Away to Rick Desper!
This game goes out of the szine next issue, unless there are any more follow
up comments.
Usually, I mention that players leaving the szine need to make arrangements
if they want to keep getting this, but everyone here is all set in some
capacity to keep receiving the szine.
Thanks for playing, I ***REALLY*** enjoyed it!!!

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): Jon Langford speaking about the US of A: 
``For a supposedly civilized First World country, I don't think you realize how 
far behind you are. You've got the largest prison population of any 
industrialized country, per capita. You have the death penalty, which hasn't 
existed in Europe for years. You have 30 channels on TV, with nothing I want to 
watch - they just disturb me with their brutality, and their lack of content.

<p>
``There's a harshness to living here: the disparity between rich and poor; 
the lack of any government involvement in the culture. You don't get that in Europe. 
It's like people really don't matter over here. And I hate the fact that I get 
hardened to it. If there's a murder in Chicago, sometimes it's not even reported. 
Hell, if there's a murder in the town I grew up in, you'd hear about it for a year.''

<p>
(JEFF to THE MEKONS): What exactly is a Mekon and why is it that it is
only quoted once a month?
<i>((That's a really good question, I think I'm a Mekon too, since
Jon Langford grabbed me up on stage at a concert of theirs a decade
or so to do a song with them.
It's more of a state of mind..... (see above)
as for being quoted once a month, that's all ***I*** am quoting them.
Fear and Whiskey is one of their greatest songs and also the title
of one of their albums from the mid-1980's.))</i>

<p>
(JEFF to EVERYONE): On the other hand, maybe Oswald acted alone!

<p>
(JEFF to STARFLEET COMMAND): Am attempting to overthrow the third
reich by wiping out Edith Keeler's existence beyond 1936.
I'm making my calculations for time travel, will report back if
successful.

<p>
(JEFF to BRITAIN): You didn't respond to my last letter?

<p>
(BRITAIN-SPAIN): It's customary to have accomplished a thing
before bragging about it, my young friend.
Just start counting the seasons!
Hell, it will take you and your kin forever just to gain the Mid -
an eternity to actually gain something of value from me.
Nevertheless, good luck.

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): During the Eisenhower Administration Nixon was
VP (translation: his job was to water the plants in the oval
office anytime Ike was gone).
The Eisenhower Administration sent over approximately 250 Green
Berets to help train the South Vietnamese to defend themselves.
Using ground troops was never intended.
The number one Republican authority on military activities in the east
was Douglas MacArthur.
On his death bed, MacArthur begged Johnson not to commit ground troops.
Johnson ignored MacArthur and his own Joint Chiefs on how to prosecute
that war.
It was the Democratic leadership, led by Johnson (who, by the way,
won a few rigged elections himself), that prosecuted that war in
such a way that we could not win because it was good for business.
Johnson is the man who should have his name dragged through the mud,
not Nixon.
PS I do have to give Johnson credit for civil rights, nothing good about 
Nixon there.

estate on my side of the pond that so attracts you people?  Get the hell
over it.  Go sack the Dutch for a change.

<p>
(TSAR to FLYING DUTCHMAN):  Now what?  Are you ready to make peace with me
yet?  Your British buddy's Empire is about to follow in the footsteps of
its Roman namesake ... give me another two years and there won't be an
English army of fleet within two thousand miles of Mother Russia. 
Britannia delenda est!  (After his nastiness - that unprovoked attack
on our person of a few years ago - we tend to prefer it that way.)  Our
eastern friend is just as blocked up against me as he is against you ...
the only thing he's good for is sucking up our units on garrison duty. 
You have a mighty navy, I'll grant that ... but try pulling those ships
past the coastline, friend, and you'll find nothing but Russia troops
waiting from Irkutsk to Egypt.  So ... do you want to talk?

<p>
(DON to ANDY): ...

<p>
(F RED SEA to F GOA): Here we come, ready or not ... 

<p>
(RUSSIA - TURKEY): How are you going to build fleets if you won't take
back those dots?  I've never seen anyone so stubborn before that they
wouldn't take the centers back.  You're more inscrutable than the
Chinese.
<i>((Terry lives off his inscrutibility better than any man I know.))</i>

<p>
(TSAR to GM): Can I build nukes?  Promise, if you let me build 'em, I'll
only use them on myself.  (Anything to shorten this ... )
<i>((Haven't you ever heard of Chinese Water Torture.
This is Rich Goranson's curse on all of you....
you won't stop this until ***I*** say you can stop it.))</i>

<p>
(EMPEROR OZOGSAN - CZAR DON): It is unfortunate. But due
to the impenetrable standoff in the Pacific and after
much debate within the Imperial Regime, I have
concluded there is more progress to be made on the
continent. It is in our best interest to revert to the
ideals of my predecessor.   

<p>
(RUSSIAN DUCK to ERIC CARTMAN, KURTUGAWA OZOG-SAN): To kick my butt you'd
need to be located in the vicinity of my righteous tail feathers.  But
- alas! - I see you are very much in front of me.  So kick, scratch,
pinch, pull hair and screech all you want, we're going to make a fight
of it for as long as either or both of you want to.

<p>
(LANCASTRIAN TSAR to YORKIST PRETENDER): Want odds that my French buddy
outlasts your sorry Limey butt?  At least he knows how to write.   

<p>
(CARTMAN - HOLLAND): Follow your dreams you can make a
difference... I'm living proof... Beef cake! Beef
cake!! 

<p>
(KENNY IN PEKING SURROUNDED BY JAPANESE ARMIES): Mmunfmmephmnmbmllmbmphuh?
