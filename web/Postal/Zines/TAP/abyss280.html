Jim, Uncle Jeffy Pooh thinks that the reason you don't have time to do the 
szine is because you really work for the CIA and the game is just a front to 
recruit new agents.  Somehow it wouldn't surprise me if you do since after 
all my other GM is military.

<i>((Damn, you ruined my career, my cover is blown, and since I've lost
that job, I guess I'm back to running a dipszine....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />I guess I am still alive, the szine I mean.
I seriously thought about doing the big folderooo, but realized if I did
I would be admitting that my life was permanently out of balance,
so I'm back - for me, not for all of you, though I hope you're glad
I'm back.
Basically, the equation was a simple time relationship.
My usual work schedule before was a 50 hours per week plus about 10
hours commuting, and then came the szine.
In the last few months, we added 5-10 hours a week to that work schedule
and guess what had to give?
I'm not really above water yet, but if I don't make a break now, I probably
would have had to fold the szine.
I think I finally have all the orders, and I thought it was better to pop out with
what I had and then set a reasonably short deadline of June 12th for the 
next issue, a date that I should be able to manage.
And then I'll make some of those deadlines optional to mix up getting the
games back on track.
Check below for what is happening to your game!
And I don't have all of my backlog of material in here yet either.
I'll get caught up on that next issue as well.
And, of course, ALL the subszines are in here in some semblance of order.
I'm sure they're glad I'm back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Next you might ask what was up with the work schedule increases.
Well, it is combination simply of being beholden to the Bush 
Administration and its approach to pushing on the federal bureaucracy
(so I've been given an increasing series of impossible deadlines with
no choice but to meet them) and teaching a new course (which always 
takes longer than you think to manage).
The first is still there and I only feel a little bit guilty out of
having a clear preference for the fall election based on self-interest.
And the second, of course, has ended.
Some more on that in an exchange with Doug Kent below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

David Wang still has the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can start RIGHT NOW to pick up one of
the unclaimed teams and play it this year!
You may recall that 
I got myself TORCHED in free agency and my team was pretty well decimated
in hitting for average and power.
And I predicted that I'd be lucky if I hit 100 homers and bat .240.
But, as Goz will tell you, I'm a horrendous seer and so I'm almost
playing .700 ball and I'm leading the league in both hitting and pitching.
Go figure....
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire

your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>LOTS</i> of people have contacted Steve Heinowski,
but he hasn't contacted ME yet.... so he goes into the twenty-five
buck list.
Sylvain played a LOT of FTF all up and down the East Coast back
in the late 1990's and then disappeared, I think he lived in Montreal
at that time.
John Quarto in particular keeps bugging me about finding Sylvain,
so I thought I'd toss him in here.
He shouldn't be THAT hard to find, but I've looked and failed.
Now it's up to you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski, Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Contributions for the next issue should be sent to Tim Haffey 
by 1st March 2004: trhaffey of aol.com or Timothy R. Haffey, Sr., 
810 53rd Ave., Oakland, CA 94601 USA. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tim is going to be formatting the issues in the "Industry 
Standard" ebook format (for one example see www.openebook.org) and this is
a major contribution that maintains Diplomacy World as a bridge
between all of the Diplomacy Hobby mediums, since it will be
easily available on the web and by post.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I (Jim Burgess) will continue to co-edit and contribute the popular
Diplomacy World Interviews (I've already interviewed such luminaries
as Richard Sharp, Edi Birsan, and Brandon Clarke).  I am currently
seeking a "quick turnaround" interview candidate for the next issue,
Number 89, who can get me a paragraph Diplomacy bio in the next
week or so.  Please ask me (burgess of world.std.com) if you have
any questions or want to volunteer to be interviewed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also would like volunteers for the next Diplomacy World Demo
Game.  The last demo game (recount, using the Modern Diplomacy
variant) never was properly written up here in DW.  I hope we
can get that in the Pouch Showcase section and a write-up here
in good time.  Rick Desper (previous DW Demo Game GM and recount
GM, rick_desper of yahoo.com), Tim Haffey, and myself will consider
those requests and make a Demo Game determination of GM, location,
and Variant (if any) to be announced in Issue Number 89.  Also,
any of the participants in recount who would like to contribute
to an article or articles on this game, should contact me or Rick.
I have all of your E-Mailed endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other articles of all types are welcome (we already have four articles
in hand, so we're in good shape for the return issue):  historical
articles, convention write-ups and descriptions, strategy or tactics
articles, personality profiles, descriptions of gaming environments,
or anything else you can think of.  If you aren't sure if it works,
ask one of us.

And last, but not least, I wish John Coffin and David Hertzman
the best of luck as they take on their new challenge of following
up Manus Hand and Edward Hawthorne as editors of The Diplomatic
Pouch.  I fervently believe that having both DW and the Pouch
active and vibrant creates better writing and better things for
all of us in the hobby.  I intentionally waited with this 
announcement until they hit the ground with two weeks running.
But 2004 should be a fun year for the hobby.

You said reformatting all the back issues before changing to "of" was a 
"someday" project unless someone volunteered... oh, now I checked a 
couple of 1997-98 issues and see they're changed.  Chances are the 
harvesters got my Claritas address within a week of the first time you 
put it in the zine, and those old lists have been propagated (and 
appended with newer addresses) ever since.  They may still be going back 
over that old ground every time a crawler gets to 
diplom.org/blahblahblah/TAP, but it may have made *no difference at all* 
that you changed either current or past "@&#223; to " of &#223;.  They may be 
harvesting from caches that aren't refreshed frequently but more likely 
these are just old lists being passed among every Russian mobster, 
Yemeni student, and script-kiddie who lacks imagination to harvest his 
own fresh names.

I have been meaning to contact you. First, I have no idea if Fantastic

I underwent open heart surgery February 24th. The original intent was to 
do a bypass and aortal repair, but when they opened me up they decided to 
forego the latter. My aorta was enlarged on one end to 4.5 cm (almost twice 
normal), but the surgeon said he would watch it the next few years and see what 
develops. 
<i>((We wish you the very best of health and that you recover well!))</i>

It was nice hearing from Beyerlein and Michalski last <i>TAP</i>. Doug 
mentioned Buz Eddy...he is a member of the AOL Dip Club but no longer active. 
He quit playing out of disgust a couple of years back. 
I touched base with John a 
while back too, but his response was so cynical that I begged off.
<i>((Yeah, no surprises there.
Buz is around here, so he is reading this, and Buz does have more than
a touch of that cynicism, as I'm sure he'd agree....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I see the usual East Coast baseball blather prevails again, as if there 
are only two teams in the Major Leagues. The debacle in Boston last fall was a 
disgrace, as if MLB needed another black eye. No character, no chemistry...a 
pox on both of them.
<i>((Fair enough.
I think the Red Sox have lots of character, but that the Yankees have mostly
lost theirs (the O'Neill, Brosius, etc. teams did have it).
And it is not fair for me to criticize this view, since I do tend to think
like every other team in the big leagues (except for my Giants, who are
NOT doing very well) is relatively irrelevant compared to the Yankees
and the Red Sox except as cannon fodder for them to beat up on.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hate to disagree with you about Milwaukee's minors, but it is not nearly 
"by far the best farm system in baseball". Granted, it is a quality system 
but Oakland, Atlanta, Minnesota and Anaheim come to mind as at least four better 
systems. The Brewers have Rickie Weeks and Prince Fiedler, but no pitching to 
speak of. And the franchise is on shaky ground. Unable to sell season tickets 
in Milwaukee, the Brewers are infiltrating Chicago's market for the locals to 
get a glimpse of the Cubbies at "Wrigley Field North". As long as they can't 
afford to pay the Richie Sexsons of the world, don't look to the Brew Crew to 
be anything more than bottom feeders.
<i>((Quite possibly, especially as Goz refused to put his money where is
mouth is and buy those lovable Brewers.
I guess I'm listening too much to Brewer team rhetoric, as I have heard that
statement being made.
I met Wendy Selig Prieb once, and she seemed like a really nice lady,
but I suppose that doesn't matter much.
And I COMPLETELY agree with you that the franchise is on very shaky ground.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The team I really like this year is Anaheim. The outfield of Guerrero, 
Anderson and Guillen is the best in baseball, Glaus and Erstad are due to 
bounce back, and they have a great young bench. Pitching will be the issue, but 
that's the case for nearly everybody.

<i>((On paper they have pretty good pitching too, with a LOT of depth in
the starters and Percival and Shields have been lights out in the bullpen.  
They've needed the depth in the position players too
as they've had to play guys named Halter and Figgins
way too often, but they are still in first place in the West, just ahead
of Doug Kent's Rangers, who've done quite OK without A-Rod.
As I also predicted, they should win that division easily.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,
Ah, Spring is in the air!  Must be time for the usual silliness.  So I 
present MLB:  the good, the bad and the ugly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Good:  I'm sure most of you saw it, but didn't realize what it 
really was or why it was good.  But it gives me hope that Major League 
Baseball is still cared about in the way that it has always been by the 
fans.  On 26 February 2004 a large crowd and national media gathered 
around Harry Carey's restaurant in Chicago.  The event:  the destruction 
of "The Bartman Ball".  
<i>((Agreed, this was a REALLY cool event, probably won't help, but
really cool nonetheless.))</i>
When last seen the Bartman Ball had been 
interfered with by a hapless fan in the top of the 8th inning of Game 6 
of the NLCS on a chilly night in Wrigley Field.  
<i>((I remain not convinced that it would have been caught anyway,
and don't hold the guy up as quite the monster some would say he is.))</i>
A few errors (real, 
mental and physical) later the Cubs had gone from 5 outs away from the 
World Series to just another Cubs disappointment, albeit a little later 
in the year than usual.  But Cubs fans are a resilient lot.  6 weeks 
before the start of the 2004 season they celebrated the destruction of 
the symbol of last year's failure, and celebrated the fact that they are 
Cubs fans.  Their "Wait 'Til Next Year" approach toward life and 
baseball is still intact and intertwined, and they are willing to once 
again drink the Kool-Aid that bonds them together.  Oh, and the fact 
that the whole thing raised $2M+ for Juvenile Diabetes research also 
helps push it into the "Good" category.  Somehow I don't see this kind 
of thing ever happening with Red Sox fans.  Too much money has corrupted 
them.
<i>((Oh come on, really!
Haven't you ever heard of the Jimmy Fund?
Admittedly, John Henry and his boys have been designing ever more inventive
ways to raise more money to justify the inflated price they paid for
the club, but the Red Sox probably are in the top 3 in the league annually
for fundraising for charities, easily.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Bad:  Ok, so here's my picks for 2004.  Goz takes no responsibility 
for any wagers, legal or otherwise, made due to his MLB forecasting 
ability (or inability):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL:  Almost every expert is picking the Cubs to make it to the World 
Series.  Say what?  On what history is this based?  Any prediction that 
has the Cubs doing something spectacular in the positive sense is 
fundamentally flawed by definition.  Nonetheless, they have assembled a 
pretty good pitching staff.  It will be interesting to see when in 
August they start wilting from the day games at Wrigley.
<i>((Or when they actually have their stupendous starting rotation
actually in place for one five game stretch.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
East:  Oh, let's start with the easy one.  Braves win their 13th in a 
row.  The only safer bet in sports is the Christians losing to the 
Lions.  Watch out for Philly though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Central:  A little tougher, as there are actually 3 teams worth 
considering.  But the Cards don't have the pitching to go along with the 
best lineup in the division, so call them 3rd.  Mark Prior is out for 
the first 6 weeks of the season, so I've got to give the division to the 
Astros.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West:  This division seems to have gotten almost as weak as the AL 
Central.  The Giants should win it, and I'll pick them, but watch out 
for the (dare I say it?) Padres, as they've started getting additional 
revenue for some better players.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wildcard:  It could be the Phillies, the Marlins holdovers, or the 
Cardinals, but I'll take the Cubs since they probably have enough to get 
there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL:  Almost every expert is picking the Red Sox to make it to the World 
Series.  Say what?  On what history is this based?  Any prediction that 
has the Red Sox doing something spectacular in the positive sense is 
fundamentally flawed by definition.  And yes, I understand I repeated 
myself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
East:  Ok, who has a guess?  Yes, the freakin' Yankees will win again.  
Watch out for Baltimore though, as they may be most improved in the AL.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Central:  What's the over/under on how many games it will take to win 
this division?  81?  78?  75?  No team is out of it, but the White Sox 
have the most talent, if Ozzie Guillien can convince them of it.  If 
not, Cleveland may sneak in with better pitching than they've had for a 
while.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West:  Anaheim.  I'm not sure how they got that much talent there.  
Maybe all the hitters that were supposed to go to the Dodgers got lost 
on the freeway.  Look out for Seattle though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wildcard:  Could be almost anyone not in the Central.  I'll take Seattle 
to edge out Oakland, Baltimore, Toronto and Boston.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Astros over Cubs.  Ouch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Yankees over Anaheim.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series:  Yankees over the old Yankees in Houston.  Coincidence?  
Ok, picking the Yankees is like picking Duke in Men's basketball, but 
there's usually a reason to pick Duke in Men's basketball, like the fact 
that they've won it before and you know before the season starts that 
they'll be in the tournament.  Hmmm...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Ugly:  John Henry complaining about George Steinbrenner's spending 
habits.  Say what?  Also, the Brewers, who used to be owned by Bud 
Selig, now have a lower payroll than the Expos, who are currently owned 
by Bud Selig.  Also, the fact that Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay have no 
chance under the current format of ever playing a meaningful game 
against each other.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Howzit lookin' there Jim-Bob?  Still convinced that the Red Sox will go 
undefeated?

Thanks for your thoughful opinions.  I do think it is interesting

Now, to the predictions:))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:
I worry MUCH that the improved Orioles, Devil Rays, and Blue
Jays will hold win totals in the AL East down so only ONE AL
East team gets in.  Al that being said, I still think we're
going to have mostly status quo.  I feel the need to predict
that IF only one team from the AL East goes it will be BOSTON
as champion.  So,
Boston, Yankees, Blue Jays, Orioles, Devil Rays
with Yankees as Wild Card very uncertainly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:
Royals, Twins, White Sox, Tigers, Indians
Twins will challenge for the Wild Card, and all four of the
top teams will challenge.  I think the Royals have the
subtle ooomph with Tony Pena's level managing to win out.
86 games or so will mean that they really beat each
other up and have NO wild card challenger.  More than 90 is possible
though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:
Angels, A's, Rangers, Mariners
I think the Mariners are going to collapse completely.  THe
Rangers will be better off without A-Rod.  A's will challenge
for the wild card, but I'll go with the easy choice and say
they've lost too much offense and Zito will stay in the toilet
as he finished last year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Angels/Yankees won by Angels;
Red Sox/Royals won by Red Sox; 
Red Sox beat Angels.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Sox beat NL person and win World Series, recognizing I'm
jinxing them.  You should feel good about that!))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:
Phillies, Mets, Marlins, Expos, Braves
Total collapse by Braves.... that's my prediction!  Mets
will surprise, but no wild card from this division, no
how, no way this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:
Cubs, Brewers, Cardinals, Astros, Reds, Pirates
I keep telling you that the Brewers have these great young players,
so I have to stand behind that with a prediction!  Yes, but
the Cubs class out the division and will run away.  Astros
will collapse as Clemens and Pettitte will NOT perform well!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:
Giants, Padres, Dodgers, Diamondbacks, Rockies
Padres will surprise and win the wild card!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Giants beat Phillies;
Cubs beat Padres;
Giants beat Cubs.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[[A few points added "today", I way overrated the Giants and Royals, and 
neither are likely to come back from where they are now, but
I nailed the AL West and I wouldn't bet against my AL East predictions
yet if I were you.
The Padres and Rangers are doing what I expected them to do, maybe even
a bit more than what I expected them to do.]]</i>

Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This fan cares some about Steroids, in the sense that it's still an issue
for the same reason that there will never be a decent revenue sharing plan:
the MLBPA.  I'd certainly like to see the same system in place that the NFL
has, and the fact that the Union doesn't acknowledge the possibility is just
plain silly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for our respective predictions:  note that we agree on 4 (!) teams out of
8 for the post-season.  When was the last time THAT happened?  Ok, ok, we
disagree on prospects for teams like Kansas City, Cleveland, Seattle,
Atlanta, Houston, Milwaukee...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hope all is well there.  Carol has, pretty much single-handedly, gotten the
inside of the new house into something we'd like to live in, and is now
working on the outside with the better weather.  I try to stay out of her

one of our very good Bistros?

at the right time?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1.  I have a rental car available, so I can meet you wherever you like.  I'm
a pretty good navigator, so if you give me a reasonably accessible
destination, I'll find it.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2.  I understand about Charlotte, of course; we'll see how that goes.  I
assume you will be telling her that I am easily the most sophisticated and
genteel of your DiploPals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3.  A bistro is fine.  Let me know where.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4.  As much as it pains me, a Habs fan, to say anything nice about the B's,
yes, they are looking very strong right now.  They made a superb pickup in
getting Sergei Gonchar from the Capitals (the one caveat here is that this
defenseman doesn't play very good defense, but he is essentially a fourth
forward on the ice for them; he's that good a passer).  They also got
Michael Nylander from Washington, and that has been a boon for both player
and new team.  Nylander is playing better for Boston than he did for the Caps.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The problem, for both Boston and Montreal, is that they play in the toughest
division in hockey.  When I checked the standings yesterday, I saw that no
other division has more than one team with 90 or more points; the Northeast
has FOUR 90-point teams.  They still have to deal with Toronto and Ottawa,
even before the playoffs begin.  Now, if Patrick Lalime were playing better
now, I would make Ottawa my Stanley Cup choice, and then go back and fill in
all the other picks; Ottawa is THAT good.  Goaltending is the Sens' only
question mark (aside from health, of course, but that's a universal concern).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But I'm getting ahead of myself; I'll write that playoff preview at the end

meet Charlotte.  I hope her production of Tommy goes well, and look 
forward to reading about it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Oh, I guess I have to say a bit about that.
For those of you who know the adaptation of <b>The Who's Tommy</b> you will
know that there are these historical vignettes covering WWII to the late
60's and Charlotte nailed ALL of the time changes for 208 full costumes in 
total, a record for her, and probably for about any small budget production.
It was a visual extravaganza across the board, but you shouldn't hear
about it from me, I'm biased.

I could tell where the "usual season ticket holders" seats were by how the

Oklahoma it wasn't.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have promised you an NHL playoff preview; here's at least half of it, 
with the other half coming tomorrow.  The caveat here is that ANY team, 
even a #8 seed, can make big noise in this sport if it gets a hot 
goaltender.  For an excellent example, see last year's Cinderellas, the 
Ducks, who rode Jean Seabastien Giguere's lights-out netminding from a 
#7 seed to a spot in the finals.  Unlike the 1-16 game in the NCAA 
basketball tournament, there is no safe matchup in the NHL playoffs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
EASTERN CONFERENCE
My normal tendency is to analyze these series in order, starting with 
the 1-8 matchup, then 2-7, and so on.  But this year's eastern pairings 
present an irresistible grouping that simply has to be listed before we 
move on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ROUND 1
#4 Toronto vs. #5 Ottawa
This matchup is fabulous; it's the Yankees-Red Sox, Cowboys-Redskins, 
Alabama-Auburn, Arsenal-Man-U.  These guys hate each other; spent a 
couple of game-years in the penalty box in a single game last month; 
play each other over and over again in the same division; and are 
wonderfully matched for a seven-game series.  The key for this series, 
as with so many others, is goaltending.  Ottawa's attack is 
overwhelming, and its goals margin (goals scored minus goals 
surrendered) was easily the best in the league.  If they had a hotter 
goaltender, I would go ahead and pencil them in as the Cup favorites.  
But Patrick Lalime, while capable, isn't the kind of playoff goalie you 
dream about; Ed Belfour of the Leafs is.  Toronto made a magnificent 
acquisition at the trade deadline by acquiring Brian Leetch from the 
hapless Rangers; he solidified a strong defense.  But Toronto's forwards 
just can't hang with Ottawa's.  The question becomes whether the 
irresistible force of the Sens' scoring attack can overcome the 
immovable object of Toronto's blueline and goaltending.  The guess here 
is yes; I give this series to Ottawa in seven games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#1 Tampa Bay vs. #8 New York
The Lightning's rise to the #1 seed in the east surprised a lot of VERY 
smart hockey people.  Sure, they benefitted from being in a bad, bad 
division (the rest of the Southeast was terrible), but finishing with 
the second best record in the league?  The answer, again, was 
goaltending; Khabibulin and Grahame, while falling off considerably 
toward the end of the season, played well enough to stake the Bolts to 
an insurmountable lead.  The Islanders, in contrast, limped into the 
final playoff slot with the poorest record of any playoff team in either 
division.  But the Isles have a card up their sleeve; they have owned 
the Lightning this season, winning three of four games in the series.  
They also have the superior defense, including a resurgent Rick DiPietro 
in net.  But what forwards those defenders will have to stop!  Tampa Bay 
has the best collection of young forwards in the whole league, including 
Martin St. Louis, who won the league scoring title.  Recent winners of 
this title have included guys names Gretzky, Jagr, Iginla, . . . and now 
a little guy from a team in Florida, fer cryin' out loud.  The season 
record has lots of Islander fans optimistic, but I say the Bolts burst 
their bubble in five games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#2 Boston vs. #7 Montreal
It's 2002, and the Stanley Cup playoffs get underway with the #1 seed in 
the east, the Boston Bruins, against the lowly Canadiens, who barely 
sneaked into the playoffs.  Boston massacred the Habs on paper, but 
Montreal won the series on the ice, leaving the Bruins wondering what 
the hell happened.  Habs fans are conjuring images of that magical run 
(well, it was only SO magical, as they lost their second round matchup 
in six games).  This year, Montreal has two excellent young forwards in 
Michael Ryder and Mike Ribeiro.  They started gathering steam in late 
February and early March, before losing three straight down the stretch, 
finally winning against Buffalo in their last game to secure the #7 
seed.  I say they're out of gas (and this is hard to say, as I'm a Habs 
fan) and won't be able to hang with Boston.  The B's picked up two 
excellent players from the Capitals at the trade deadline, Sergei 
Gonchar and Michael Nylander.  Gonchar is the best scoring defenseman in 
the league, essentially another forward on the ice (and his defense 
suffers accordingly; his nickname in Washington was "The Gate", for the 
way he swung open to let opposing attackers through).  Nylander adds 
depth up front.  Joe Thornton, assuming his health holds up, is probably 
the best two-way player in the league.  And Andrew Raycroft has been 
wonderful in net.  Boston in six games, but this one could get ugly and 
go down sooner.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#3 New Jersey vs. #6 Philadelphia
Another wonderful matchup between two teams from the same division who 
despise each other.  New Jersey's defense, toughness, and goaltending 
are nonpareil; it's hard to pick against Martin Brodeur in any seven 
game series.  But I'm going to do it anyway, because of the absence of 
the soul of the team, defenseman Scott Stevens, who is out indefintely 
from post-concussion syndrome.  His toughness is part of the reason why 
the Devils defense is so overwhelming; while Scott Niedermayer is an 
excellent blueliner in his own right, the team simply isn't the same 
without Stevens.  Philly's key, ironically, is in goal.  I say it's 
ironic because Robert Esche, the #1 man in net, is a lights-out 
goaltender who can play with anyone.  But the knock on him, unfair as it 
may be, is that he isn't playoff tested.  And in this game, playoff 
experience means a great deal.  Philadelphia backers will panic and howl 
for the team to insert one of their capable backups, Jeff Hackett or 
Sean Burke, at the first hint of weakness by Esche.  If that happens, 
the kid's confidence may be shot.  The teams' offenses match up well; 
the Devils' line of Elias, Gionta, and Gomez has been very hot lately, 
while Philly counters with two lines that might be first lines anywhere 
else.  Philly has more depth at blueline; New Jersey has better 
individual stars, IF Stevens returns.  I'm betting agsinst that.  
Philadelphia in seven games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ROUND 2
Remember that in the NHL playoffs, they reseed the teams after each 
round.  So if you're the #7 seed and upset the #2 team, your likely 
reward is to play the #1 team next.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tampa Bay vs. Philadelphia
Talk about contrasting styles; the Flyers play a tough, physical game, 
while the Lightning are all youth, speed, and razzle-dazzle.  I have 
thought all year that the Lightning have been playing over their heads, 
and I think this is where it catches up to them.  This assumes that the 
Flyers' players stay reasonably healthy, but Flyers in five games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ottawa v. Boston
Two series, and neither team gets to move out of its own division yet.  
(The Northeast Division was the strongest in the league this year, 
placing four of its five teams in the playoffs.  Consider how hard that 
is to do with an unbalanced schedule.)  Personally, I think The Sens are 
better on paper, as their offense is magnificent; Boston, in contrast, 
is less showy but steadier.  This one is very hard for me to call, 
especially as I think Ottawa will have a much tougher time in its first 
round series.  But I still have the Sens moving on in seven games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CONFERENCE FINALS
Ottawa vs. Philadelphia
Okay, what kind of moron picks the fifth and sixth seeds to make it to 
the conference finals?  I do, that's who.  (Relax; that ain't gonna 
happen in the west.)  This one won't have the passion of Philly-New 
Jersey or Ottawa-Toronto in the first round, but these guys can still 
generate a lot of antipathy for one another.  My head tells me it's 
Philadelphia, especially as I have the Sens moving through two extremely 
emotional seven game series, while Philly gets an easier draw in round 2 
(but remember the caveat about Scott Stevens' early return, which might 
knock them out in round 1).  My heart, though, tells me that this is 
Ottawa's year to make it to the finals.  Ottawa in six.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, if anyone here wants to take these picks and head to the betting 
parlor, let me tell you that you're beter off trying the Powerball 
Lotto.  But that's how one hockey fan sees things as the REAL season 
begins.  Game on!

<br /><br /><b>Steve Emmert (Wed, 7 Apr 2004 22:16:22 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let's head to the West, where most of the power teams have resided for 
the past several years.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ROUND 1
#1 Detroit vs. #8 Nashville
On paper, this is a blowout; the Wings won the President's Trophy for 
the best record in the league, while the Preds were one of only two 
playoff teams to give up more goals than they scored over the course of 
the regular season.  Maybe it goes five games, but maybe not.  But wait; 
the season series between these clubs was 3-3.  The overwhelming talent 
of the Wings translated into a dead heat with a recent expansion team.  
What's more, the Preds have a hot, underappreciated goaltender in Tomas 
Vokoun.  Detroit was embarrassed last year by getting swept by the #7 
seeded Ducks (proof of my hypotheses that one hot goalie can carry you 
deep into the playoffs, and that no high seed is a safe bet).  I still 
think the Wings win this series, and that the magnificent Pavel Datsyuk 
will simply take over at times; but look for the Preds to extend it all 
the way to seven games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#2 San Jose vs. #7 St. Louis
The Blues essentially backed into the playoffs, beating out the Oilers 
on the next to last day of the regular season despite losing their own 
game.  They are the other team in this year's playoffs who got outscored 
over the course of the season.  I don't think they have anywhere near 
the guns to stick with the resurgent Sharks, who made it to the Western 
Conference finals in 2002 before fading badly last year and missing the 
playoffs.  This year's edition is a monster, with no stud scorer in the 
lineup, but incredible depth.  Biggest mismatch of the first round; 
Sharks in five (and I think I'm being generous to the Blues).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#3 Vancouver vs. #6 Calgary
A fascinating matchup of the Canucks' marvelous offense against the 
Flames' stingy defense.  (Canadian fans are probably angry that of the 
five teams from north of the border in the playoffs, four of them face 
each other in the first round this year.)  Vancouver's first line was 
nonpareil until Todd Bertuzzi got a bad case of the stupids and finds 
himself watching "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" reruns for the 
duration, thanks to a hit that was probably malicious assault and 
battery.  Vancouver will miss his play in the offensive zone, though 
Markus Naslund and veteran Trevor Linden (who led the team's run to the 
Cup finals ten years ago) will fill in nicely.  On Calgary's side of the 
equation, Jarome Iginla is a major stud, but the real story is Miikka 
Kiprusoff, a Sharks castoff who landed in Alberta and merely set a 
record for lowest GAA in modern history (1.69).  The combination of 
Kiprusoff's hot streak and Bertuzzi's absence leads me to pick Calgary 
in six.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
#4 Colorado vs. #5 Dallas
Two of the best teams in all of hockey find themselves playing each 
other in a 4-5 matchup.  Who says hockey needs shaking up?  Dallas has 
the best defense in the west, and the Avs stumbled into the playoffs, 
getting just two wins in their last ten games.  This is not a good time 
to be fading, boys.  Colorado's top two lines, when healthy, are 
unmatched anywhere, and they have some very talented defensemen; the 
question mark is goaltender David Aebischer, who put together a fine 
regular season, but doesn't have much of a playoff record, thanks to 
carrying Patrick Roy's skates for the last few years.  Dallas's defense 
is anchored by their wonderful goalie, Marty Turco, and a suffocating 
neutral zone trap; they simply don't lose at home (only seven regulation 
home losses the entire year).  Add to that the Avs' injury problems 
(Paul Kariya is out for now; while Milan Hejduk, Rob Blake, and the 
oft-injured Peter Forsberg will play at least some of this series hurt), 
and I see a Dallas victory in six games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ROUND 2
Detroit vs. Calgary
The brain says the Wings, easy.  But the gut tells me that Calgary will 
be a very dangerous draw for Detroit, especially if Kiprusoff stays hot 
and the Flames pick up a few extra power plays; Calgary had an impotent 
game with the man advantage this year, but Iginla is always a threat to 
get hot, especially if he isn't closely shadowed man-to-man.  I think 
Detroit's relative age - they are MUCH older on average than the young 
Flames, with the notable exceptions of Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg - 
will tell, especially if I'm right about their having a tough seven game 
series against Nashville in Round 1.  I'll go with the Wings in seven 
games, stealing Game 7 in the Joe, right in the middle of Hockeytown 
USA.  If I'm right, this will be a big night for the Detroit Police 
Department, unfortunately.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
San Jose v. Dallas
Old guard vs. new line; the Stars are perennial Cup contenders, while 
the Sharks' run two years ago had to be regarded by most fans as an 
aberration.  The comparison shows that San Jose has a wonderful defense; 
Dallas's is better.  San Jose has a marvelous goalie; Dallas's is 
better.  San Jose has a steady but unspectacular front line; Dallas's is 
better.  I hate to say this (I dislike Dallas and New Jersey, damn 'em), 
but Dallas in six games.  I sincerely hope I'm wrong about this one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
CONFERENCE FINALS
Detroit vs. Dallas
Well, aren't these the two best teams in the west, records 
notwithstanding?  Aren't both teams playoff tested, full of depth and 
seasoned veterans?  Don't they both have good coaching staffs?  Is there 
a dime's worth of difference between these two teams?  You're damned 
right there is; Detroit has too much firepower, from too many 
directions, to be stopped even by Dallas's excellent defense.  Expect a 
lot of 2-1 games, but look for the Red Wings to take the west in six 
games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
STANLEY CUP FINALS
Ottawa vs. Detroit
I see this matchup as Goliath vs. Goliath; the Sharks were the last 
Davids left.  Ottawa's all-round game against Detroit's technical 
brilliance and depth.  Both teams have goaltender questions, which might 
ultimately keep both out of the finals.  But in this one, I give a 
slight edge to Patrick Lalime of Ottawa over Detroit's Curtis Joseph.  
Ironically, if Detroit loses confidence in CuJo and turns the series 
over to their talented backup, Manny Legace, I think Detroit's chances 
actually improve.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Decision time, Stevie.  Ottawa wins the first Stanley Cup to find its 
way back to Canada since the Canadiens won, back in 1993.  Senators in 
six games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, shall we turn to who will win the Masters?  You know, if Mike Weir 
repeats, that means that both the Masters title AND the Stanley Cup 
could be held by Canadians . . . if only it were Canadiens . . .

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Steve Emmert (Mon, 19 Apr 2004 08:56:06 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As if there were any need to bolster the contention that, considering all of
the playoffs, the NHL's are far and away the best - 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1.  Most sports fans would agree that the most exciting two words in sports
are, "Game Seven."  Tonight and tomorrow, we have THREE Game Sevens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2.  Sudden death means much more in a seven-game series.  You work and you
toil for six grueling games, end regulation in Game Seven in a tie, and then
go to sudden death overtime.  This is unlike all of the other major sports.
Baseball, great as it is, doesn't have sudden death.  Football does, but
they don't have playoff series.  Basketball has seven games and overtime,
but they always play a designated amount of time.  Only a hockey series can
end in the blink of an eye.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3.  Speaking of overtime, have you seen how many of these games have gone
into extra periods?  And how many have needed multiple extra sessions?  In
the regular season, overtime is only five minutes.  But in the playoffs,
they keep playing extra twenty-minute periods until someone scores.  One
game recently went well into triple overtime, meaning the two teams played
alomst as much sudden-death overtime as they did regulation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I haven't gone back to check on my picks yet, but at this point, I think I
have absolutely blown one of my predictions (Dallas over Colorado), while
most of the rest are at least still alive going into tonight's action.  But
you know what?  I don't care!  With all these great series, I don't mind
being wrong.  Of course, it's usually better to be right, with one exception
- Go Habs!  Pound those damned B's tonight!

P.S.  Can I get an amen from the congregation for the Los Angeles Dodgers,
who have (albeit temporarily) the best record in baseball?

<i>((I am a San Francisco Giants fan, and even a Barry Bonds fan, since I
was a huge Bobby Bonds fan in my youth, so I really, really, really hate
the Dodgers, but you have an AMEN from me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Steve Emmert (Tue, 20 Apr 2004 08:40:40 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The intriguing thing is that the Habs get Tampa Bay next, which definitely
presents an opportunity.  The Bolts have overachieved this year, and I think
Montreal actually matches up better against them than they would have
against, say, the Flyers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, what I'd love to see is the Habs winning the second round series, and
the Toronto/Ottawa winner taking out Philly.  That would guarantee a
Canadian team in the Cup finals.  And who knows?  Calgary could conceivably
make it through, too.  One hot goaltender can take a team a long way (see
last year's edition of the Ducks).  Can you envision the ABC executives
crying in their collective beer over a Calgary/Ottawa Cup finals???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While none of this fantasizing is likely to come to pass, I will at least
have one consolation, no matter how the rest of the playoffs go - neither
Dallas nor New Jersey, my two least favorite teams, will hoist the Cup this
year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you want, I can give you a revised look at the second round after
tonight's game settles the matchups.  Let me know.  Best wishes to
Charlotte.

Dear Jim,
First things first... if you can think of any specific topics for

free to let me know.
Maybe I'll write one on applying Dip skills to prison life.
<i>((That will work, please write one, please....

Diplomacy player and the self interested penny stock trader.
In each case, you want to bring people along with you
but you also are trying to set them up to stab the hell out
of them down the road, so you get the big profit.
And of course you have to build trust with them to bring them along
and in doing that, YOU might be the one who takes the fall.
Something like that would be interesting....
but whatever you want.
Probably at this point we're talking about the next deadline.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Life in prison has been pretty uneventful lately.
I finally had my appointment with the dermatologist.
He excised one of my lesions for biopsy.
I guess I didn't explain part of that story properly last time - 
I should have specified that the PA's here outrightly refused
to have anyone except the dermatologist remove the lesion.
That's why getting the appointment was so important.
Anyway, I should have the biopsy results in the next week or two.
<i>((You have to remember that I'm a health economist, so
forgive me if I "don't get that" and go on a bit further.
Usually, PA's in federal service (e.g. in the VA where I work)
like the idea that they aren't subject to state guidelines that
limit the scope of their work so much.
And it obviously is much cheaper the less they have to contract
out to the outside dermatologist.
Ordinarily, the other reason a particular health provider gets
antsy about doing something around the limits of their official
duties is the risk of malpractice.
If the PA was at risk of being sued if something came out badly,
then it could ruin their career or cause bloating in their
insurance premiums.
Well, again, in federal service (and I'm pretty sure this applies
to prisons too) that is not a worry.
The dermatologist, too, is not worried about this since if you
want to sue over malpractice, you have to sue the federal 
government, not the dermatologist.
And then, like all suits against the federal government, they
get to decide whether you actually get to sue them or not.
Anyway, don't mind me, but if you know I'd kinda like to know
what I'm not getting here.
Perhaps it is just that the PA's feel underpaid and overworked
and thus they are "working to rule".  
In fact, that's most likely it.....
what is more important of course, I hope things are working out
for your biopsy and skin conditions!
I don't think you said in the follow up letter (still going through
everything for this issue).))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The big excitement in the last few weeks was today's visit to the
camp by the Regional Director from Washington, DC.
Lots of rumors have been going around about the future of this
facility....
we're going to be shut down, we're going to lower our population
level, we're going to have an additional 200 inmates brought in.
Nobody knows the truth yet.
Generally, inmate rumors are way off-base.
<i>((Probably just a regularly scheduled visit.
I'm surprised, a bit, that the Regional Director is based in 
Washington, rather than out in the field, but if he is, then
of course he needs to make regular rounds visiting all of the
prisons.
Why does there have to be "something up"?
Of course, many of you inmates are 	"short-timers" so you
haven't been around long enough to see the cycles of the 
visits.
What makes it even more likely that is the case is the
wildly disconnected nature of the rumors.
Usually, rumors are more likely to on target if they fit
into each other.
For example, in the Dept. of Veterans Affairs right now,
nationally, there are large rumors going on about plans
to reconfigure the organization drastically in Bush II
(second term when such things usually happen).
I hope I don't get in trouble for putting these things
out on the Internet in a szine, but I'll disguise things
a bit and see if that works.... and no names.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((You can put some facts together to see why that is
the case:
(1) A top senior manager for health issues was forced to resign
a few months ago, so much so that they had to "write
his resignation letter for him" (short and all flowery
boilerplate); (2) The Secretary has filed legislation
to allow the new top senior manager in this position
(which needs Congressional approval) to be a
"qualified business person" rather than a physician,
as currently is required; (3) The physician who is 
acting in that position is pushing really
hard (really hard!) on a 12 month planning horizon
(12 goals for 12 months).  
Then rumors from that look like the following:
(1) the acting person in this key health job is bailing
out of DC into the field when everyone had thought
he wanted to be the next one in that permanent position;
(2) virtually every other senior manager in Washington
is currently rumored to be jumping into all sorts of 
other field positions out of Washington; (3) the
Bush people are planning for that new "business person"
in the top health job to contract out large portions
of the work of VA hospitals, drastically cut back
on support for research and education and connections
with medical schools, and probably drop large portions
of the inpatient care VA hospitals do, essentially ending
more of their lives as hospitals and turning them into
outpatient clinics contracting with hospitals.
This, of course, would dramatically increase outside
contracting with the private sector and would be
essentially "privatizing" inpatient hospital care,
a fine Republican goal.
This being said only WEEKS after the VA has announced
their last "base-closings" commission report.
Time to move to the next capital plan, which would be
much more drastic.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Now, this might be fine policy, and it all might WELL
be rumor, but it is more likely to be true when the 
rumors line up into the steps in something larger.
The rumors of inmates, as you say, unfortunately
doesn't do this and is less likely to be true.
As a side note, this policy could be a last straw
that exacerbates crises that are brewing in national
health policy.
The medical schools in the US simply cannot afford
to deal with what would happen if they no longer
had the federal government to pay for the salaries
of so many of their faculty and they will not be able
to find places to train their residents to replace the VA.
Should be a fascinating debate.
And it is what is being considered.
I've been in enough high level meetings to see the
handwriting on that wall, even if the specifics of
some of the rumors are off.
How would your prison rumors fit into something larger
like that?
That's how I think you assess their veracity.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other big topic of conversation is the so-called Libra Act
which supposedly offers ways for inmates to increase their
"good-time" days (time off for good behavior).
You hear something new about that every day too.
Congress passed it... the Senate passed it... it's in 
Committee... it's being reconciled...
it's all a sham... who knows?
<i>((And this is because, of course, they haven't given
you access to the Internet, where you can learn the facts
behind such rumors very quickly.
When I and my boss heard the rumor above about the
intent to hire a non-physician into this top health
job at the VA, we knew legislation was required to 
make that happen, looked it up on the Internet,
and voil&#224;, there the legislation was: rumor to fact.))</i>
One fact is clear - Federal Prison populations are rising
(due to mandatory minimum sentences and the ever-growing
reach of the Federal Government) while the budget for
the Bureau of Prisons is shrinking.
Something has to give.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Again, from our agency, the push-push-push is to
do more with less.
Force workers to get things done in less time, or using
unpaid overtime if they can't get it done in less time,
since deadlines are set and they are non-negotiable.
Provide fewer resources to get things done right and
focus on outcomes with quality demands, etc.
These are Bush Administration mantras.
This may not be a bad thing, but it is a different thing,
government feels like the private sector much more now,
without the private sector perks.
And the sword of contracting out is there.
Of course, it isn't just in Iraq and the military
that contracting out, in the absence of full and
complete quality specified performance contracts,
is problematic.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The public doesn't seem to understand this issue
explicitly, but this election and these debates
between the Democrats and Republicans really is
about whether you believe in rule governed directive
based administration (write rules and make people
do as you want) or more flexible processes that rely
on individual initiative and decentralization of
control for administration of policies and programs.
This issue goes back to the Reaganization of the
Republican party, and is why ever since then Democrats
have been painted as "flip-floppers".
This is what decentralization of control oriented
people must look like, since they won't write 
strict directives for behavior, believing that
"complete contracts" to do this are not possible.
To me, this is a legitimate question and is the key
for what really is dividing the country.
Does it really make sense to have strict sentencing
guidelines, or do you want to have judges make 
context specific decisions based on what is in
front of them in particular cases?
In the former, you make mistakes when the rules 
force judges to send people to jail who really
probably shouldn't be there, but it is "easy"
and in some general sense "fair".
In the latter, you make mistakes if you don't
appoint good judges who will make good decisions
when exercising context specific judgment.
And, of course, judgment is still an issue in
appointing the judges and administrators in a
directive and rule based structure too, since
you still have to "apply the rules fairly".
The whole thing becomes circular, doesn't it?
I don't know, Doug, am I making any sense,
or am I taking arguments that are too complex
and simplifying them too far?))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I think we can get the Winter orders in by the 12th and stay on schedule.
SORRY for getting this new game started so badly!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY to FRANCE):  I can only hope that you know what you are doing and that you
did what you said you would.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GYPSIES IN THE PALACE to BERLIN):  Mi dispiace molto, sai, ma ... ooops!  
Hey, very sorry to have dropped in like this but, given the buzz in this game, 
I thought I'd better get mine while the getting was good.  
No malice intended, but you are like a super magnet in a bin of screws ...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-SILESIA): If this space is actually vacant, my apologies.  
But fool me twice, shame on me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY): Sorry man, you looked too good not to eat. I had to get that 
forbidden fruit. I wonder if it's my downfall though.......

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): I think you were left foraging the wilds of the Silesian hills,
relatively unsuccessfully.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GYPSIES to TRAMPS AND THIEVES (AKA FRANCE AND RUSSIA)):  You're here just 
in time to start the Reformation.  Start nailing things to the doors ...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLE"METAL"): We have been in the perpendicular universe
for six months.
I think being changed into a Ferengi has done something to me.
I just signed an agreement with the evil Commander Worf and two other unknown
aliens to form a co-op that will essentially annex an entire culture.
Everyone seems amiable and the aliens themselves have offered anyone who
joins our alliance the perpendicular universe equivalent of Romulan ale.
I really don't know who these aliens are, but at least they have a
sense of humor....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GYPSIES to TRAMPS):  BTW, you should hear what the Thieves say about you when 
you're not around.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to FRED):  I sincerely hope you made a determined effort to keep your hands 
off Venice.  You wouldn't like it anyway.  Very soggy.  Hard to drive around in 
those German cars you favor.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(VENICE to LIVERPOOL):  So, what did you decide to do, and who did you decide 
to do it to?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A CONVERSATION KIRK (K) AND SPOCK (S)):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Captain Kirk, please come to the Bridge.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: What now?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: I've made some progress on our com pic view screen.
We just received a transmission from one of our alien allies.
I think I can get a partial picture.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K (now on the bridge with Spock as the static from the "cheat'em"
view screen clears) - The Captain and crew witness one of the strangest
sights they'd ever seen.
The picture showed a shop of what looked like large intelligent Tribbles
with short arms and legs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Fascinating.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Spock, did we just make an alliance with a group of evolved Tribbles?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M (Dr. McCoy): Hey, Jim, ya think we should introduce these guys to 
Commander Worf?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: I'd buy a ticket to that!
Spock, did you scans reveal anything else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Yes, Captain, some of the transmissions we picked up from the Tribble
home world indicate that they are familiar with the alien group
we are attempting to take over.
According to the transmission, the alien group is called Human and we
are about to support an assault on a perpendicular universe planet
called "Earth".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M: Damnit, Jim, it's bad enough that the idiot Bajorans have given
humanity to the Romulans in our Universe, you've got to destroy 
humanity in this Universe!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: We can't turn back now, and besides, the Human leader is 
offering Ale to anyone who makes it to Earth.
If we can keep the alliance together we can make the
occupation a benevolent one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M: This could make Spock the last human in the galaxy even
if he is only half human!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: I need a Romulan Ale!....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Let me know if you really think you need until the July 3rd deadline
for Spring, since we're jumping right back into it.
It will take only one request to get that extension.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IRKED, ITALIANS AND IRE back to the recent GERMAN PRESS):  The Italian 
leadership has been rocked by a diplomatic coup, so crucial that it 
overrides the aptly-named recent German "PEABRAIN" policy, which showed 
the incoherence expected from the German planner.  Some Western Triple 
power suckered the Sultan into believing that Italy "may be attacking" 
Turkey in the immediately past autumn months, despite having no 
sustainable way to do such a thing, and ignoring frequent Italian 
messages offering reassurances and effective cooperative plans.  Buying 
this story was less than peabrained.  Either he was completely played 
for a fool, or Uncle Jeffy Pooh's psycho nephew wants to grab dots now, 
thinking it will get him closer to the win than a strong alliance would. 
<i>((Yes, tell us something that we don't know....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Half-fast thinking there.  Italy now offers a full truce to EFG or any 
combination above, with the specific purpose of turning Italian forces 
against Turkey and preventing the Turk from mounting any challenge 
toward continental hegemony.  Italy further offers discussion of terms 
for full alliance, including negotiated gradual return of formerly 
French centers as heroic Italian forces liberate key cities from Turkish 
oppression.  The first Italian demonstration of good intent shall be the 
immediate disbandment of our vanguard fleet in the northern Atlantic 
waters, a fleet poised to support Turkish naval forces into Liverpool as 
a first reward for years of Turco-Italian alliance.  Those years were 
thrown away in a single stroke by an impatient Sultan.  That error must 
be rebuked, and if French and German military leaders can show some 
restraint and good prioritization, Italy will do her share in keeping 
the continent free and undominated.
<i>((Ah, I see, a proposal and a divination.... boy, is he wordy
this time, I LOVE it!!!  
Bring it on!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARNO INTERPRETS A DIPLOMATIC MOTTO):  "Perfection is achieved not when 
there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to 
take away."  ("La perfection est atteinte non quand il ne reste rien &#224; 
ajouter, mais quand il ne reste rien &#224; enlever.")  The problem is that, 
for a perfect game, you must have 17 units all occupying foreign supply 
centers in one gameyear.  Otherwise the game ends while there are still 
supply centers for you to take away.
<i>((I had to think about this too... are we getting in too deep here??))</i>

1) Draw passes.  I'll have the SC counts next time, then 
continue to print End Game
Statements to the issue after that.
Thanks, everyone, I wish Buddy well in his illness motivated transitions.
I hope you (through Jim and directly) will keep in touch.
But given that Buddy was likely to have to resign, I think that pushed
everyone over the edge into calling it a draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>End Game Statements:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AUSTRIA STANDBY (Rauterberg):
This game, with its wide variance of challenges, proved to be 
quite an adventure for a standby Austrian.
I joined the game quite early on, allied with Randy Ellis' Turkey, 
and pushed back advances on my frontiers by Italy
and Russia.  Indeed, I was fortunate enough to be able to continue on 
into Italy and take over that country as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At this point, perhaps A/T was a bit TOO successful.  The nations 
of the West allied with Russia against us, and we were forced to think 
"stalemate lines" rather than to anticipate any further advancement.
Now Randy grew tired of participating in the hobby, resigned, and 
my implacable A/T alliance crumbled.  The rest of the game was an 
exercise in survival, and my Austrian forces were driven into Italy to 
make their last stand while the dogs of war snarled over my homeland.  
And so things ended.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
Fall 1915 is one game year by that measure.
PS I may do a GM judgment call that no "real" center movement
has occurred if there are only small insignificant trades of
centers that are done (that will include the one that looks
like it might happen this fall).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I forgot to put your deadline in last time, but this
is one of our "soft" Winter turns with no changes.
Please get your Spring orders in for next issue!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PHIL TO JIM): I commend you on adopting the policy of ending this
game by ruling that "no real center movement has occurred if
there are only small insignificant trades of centers that are
done." You must have been reading my mind! BRAVO!
<i>((Well, it won't be ENDING the game exactly, since we will just
get to the point where someone wanting the game to continue will not
be allowed to have "perpetual no" draw votes.
We may or may not have anyone with such an order submitted.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
The two man race among those who actually are playing is winding down....

Total Replenishments: 12+37+22 = 71

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
I'm not setting up a separate scoring method.
BUT..... we can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM - RICK):  Was I prescient, or what?  Jump the field with 63 replacement
points!  Wow, I'm  impressed!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RICK - &gt;  TOM):  I don't remember what we decided at DipCon.  Am I
supposed to race for the first sprint or not?  I did that in Fat
Bottomed Girls and I'm not very optimistic about the result.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ZEDD - FIELD): C'mon you lot - how can I be last from here??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOULDER - ZEDD):  Petal to the metal, man!  You gonna coast for a while, or shoot
your wad for something like fourth or fifth place at the first sprint line?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM - DAVE):  Congrats on your win in Grand Lake!  You going to repeat here?  Me
thinks you'll be needing to spike the track for Desper...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(B - BOOB): So there's no maximum card value then?? Teach me not to read 
the rules!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to B): And you also missed the rule that you only get the Breaking
Away bonus on the FIRST turn you break away??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CHIEF WIGGUM - &gt;  ONLOOKERS):  Nothing to see here, move along, move
along. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to BOOB):  Ok, I get it.  You got Zedd out in front on position, and
Desperate Team Desper out in front on points.  That's nice!  But, the 64 dollar
question is: who's gonna win?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TOM): Last I looked, Bruce was still controlling Zedd and the other
last again's.
Congrats to Bruce on continuing to get his life back together and his 
forthcoming new address.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A concession to Ukraine is proposed.
Please vote with your Spring orders.
I think the handwriting is on the wall here to everyone, but
it's your choice if you want to play it out. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "I'm so happy, focused on destruction!"
from "I'm So Happy", a song on the brand new Mekons release, <i>Punk Rock</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GAME): I think I missed this press last time.... if not, here it is again....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND - SPAIN/GERMANY):  London is yours. Take it.
And Liverpool too if you may. Have fun!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPANISH TRIBUNE): Reports are study that the Ukrainian invasion of the 
mainland of Europe has extended all possible means of being halted even the 
President of Spain has issued an statement to the Ukrainian leader that 
Spain has surrendered its arms as long as it retains survival status. 
Reports still are coming in....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): We have achieved another mild victory as we have re-taken
the Ferengi Divine Treasury and have scratched another Romulan troop 
transport.
The Romulans, with the help of a group of PUSSIES from the planet Bajor,
are about to win.
Why anyone would rather surrender than fight is beyond my comprehension.
StarFleet is now teaching its cadets to speak Romulan.
Many thanks to our Klingon and Cardassian allies for a good fight.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD): Well, good game. Jim, I'll be sending in my end game statement 
soon. grats to Dave on a game well played.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): How can 27 units win a 64 supply center game?
I thought based on 18 centers winning a 35 supply center original
game that 33 would win this game.
This sounds like "fuzzy math"???
<i>((Well, perhaps because 33 centers ARE required to win this game,
and right now someone has 32 centers, but no one has 33, so the game
goes on.
Forgive me if my math is fuzzy enough that I don't understand the question?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD): I forward the vote of a Ukraine/Romulan solo victory. I vote yes 
on it regardless. I fail to see how we can possible stop Ukraine from 
gaining the one more he needs to win the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): At least SOMEONE gets it.... would you educate your Uncle on
the "new math"?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KURT OZOG ON THE MEKONS): FYI- The Illinois Entertainer issue for this month
features the Mekons, your favorite! The cover of the
issue has a modern picture of the Mekons. I cannot
believe how horrible Sarah Corina looks now. I mean,
she **really** changed for the worse in 5 years. You
can't help but notice.
<i>((Thanks much for sending it to me!!
I will have more comment on this shortly.
Sarah is the bassist and she's a bit overweight, I would say.....
for those who don't know what Kurt's talking about.))</i>
