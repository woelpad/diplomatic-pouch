SPECIAL DON WILLIAMS CHRISTMAS EVE PRESENT: JUST THE Phil Reynolds Early View
went out to the Phil Reynolds players.  Merry Christmas especially to 
Don Williams, but to all of you.
In my field, these days, when you get an article published it comes up first
on the web in "Early View".
Now the rest of you can see the full issue, lots of action, including a 
wealth of Peeriblah! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />There was interest in a NEW regular Diplomacy game and a Breaking Away game. 
We start BOTH of those in this issue.  Any interest in something else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

<b>DIPLOMACY WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT IS ONGOING - YOU CAN STILL JOIN!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my current game.
Yes, in C-Diplo, you can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.
There is about to be a huge uptick in games starting as January approaches
in a few days.
Lots of games are waiting for more players to start, won't you come join me???

<b>HOUSE RULES FOR <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />1) The GM is God, but in his/her infinite fairness players have the right to a mutually agreeable ombudsperson in the event of any dispute. The ombudsperson would have the right to force me to adhere to accepted standard hobby practice, whatever that might happen to be
at that point in time. Basically, I abhor the concept of house rules, causing me to do revisions only every fifty issues or so (originally appearing in issue 32, 84, 134, 157, 211, and now 343). Yes, it has been a while, over a hundred issues since my last revision. If you don't like a "loose" style, I suggest you play elsewhere. Players may inquire at any time concerning how I would rule on any particular "peculiar situation." In the strict sense, those are the house rules. PERIOD. I will, however, fill about a page explaining what might better be called ÃŸtandard practices."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) If I fail to obtain orders from a player, a standby will be called. Please note that NMR follow ups to attempt to get orders usually will be made after the deadline. Phoned or E-Mailed orders (as well as changes to existing orders) will be accepted up until the time the game is adjudicated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Country selection is by preference list, but the preference lists generally will not be used unless all or almost all players submit one. Otherwise, countries will be assigned by random draw. If a game started with some players not submitting a preference list, those players will
be assigned randomly first and then the preference lists will be applied to the remaining 
positions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) Any GM error must be pointed out by the next deadline or the error stands until discovered. Once discovered, repairs will be made if possible; however, turns and movement will not be taken back. Please note that since all seasons are separated (except Autumn/Winter), that means that players must write immediately if they detect an error. Deadlines customarily will be on Saturdays, NMR requests will be made over that weekend, and the adjudications will be E-mailed as soon as possible in the following week. Deadlines fall at monthly intervals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) NMR's in Spring 1901 will not be allowed. If a player cannot be reached, the game will be delayed and a standby will be called.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) Orders should be submitted in a clear manner and obtained via a verifiable source (such as postally, by phone or from a known E-Mail address). "Nth" is my standard abbreviation for the North Sea. "Nor" always is held to be ambiguous and the order will not be followed. All other abbreviations should not permit more than one meaning. I have a tendency to try to interpret player intentions though I try to keep it under control. If you wish an order to be intentionally miswritten, point it out to me or prepare to face the consequences. I realize that this could be construed as limiting the use of miswritten orders, but imagination is limitless. I always will back a player who intentionally miswrites orders as falling in the ambiguous category. Handwriting shall be no messier than mine if you submit postal orders. Conditionals seldom are necessary, but be sure to have an "in all other cases" clause if you use them. If not, units without a condition will hold. Conditionals may be made based on who is playing a potential standby position.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7) Draws may be proposed at any time. Players may wish to specify the season in which they are to be voted on, the default is the one immediately following (even if it is a Summer season). Draw votes are never confirmed in public for any reason by the GM and must be unanimous to pass. Failure to vote counts as a no vote, unless specifically amended by the GM with at least two seasons warning in extraordinary cases.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
8) All games are black press unless three players request otherwise (status may change in the middle of a game). Black press means any dateline, including attempts at impersonation, are allowed from anyone.  Press generally is encouraged strongly. The GM reserves the right to edit but wields a very loose editing pen. Abuse of the GM is required if you intend to abuse other players.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
9) Maps generally are provided with all adjudications for regular Diplomacy games, though occasionally they are are omitted for reasons of space on Winter or Summer seasons only. Maps in Spy Diplomacy are provided for each season separately to each player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
10) I blatantly ripped off Bruce Geryk and Melinda Holley in producing the original version of these house rules (way back in issue 32) and have edited them very little yet again in the present version (lazy bastard that I am). Nevertheless, I reserve the right to change these standard practices at any time with little warning.

<b>Larry Peery (Sun, Dec 22, 2013 at 7:45 PM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I, Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, am here today to claim that justice which 
is due to my people, and the assistance promised to it eight months ago, 
when fifty nations asserted that aggression had been committed in violation 
of international treaties."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Haile Selassie, plea to the League of Nations, June 1936.

INTRODUCTION: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Several people asked me over the last year how I came up with some of the ideas 
for various pieces of Peeriblah that appeared in <i>Diplomacy World, The Diplomatic Pouch</i>
(both of them), <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> or <i>A Fleet in Paris</i> - not to mention 
the hundreds of mini-articles and comments I posted to scores of publications, 
blogs and news sites online.  I told them it was just like having kids: 
you can ask for a boy or a girl; you can hope whichever you get comes out healthy; 
and for the rest you have to trust in the Good Lord.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometimes for me something, and it can be almost anything, will suggest an idea for a story. 
The fastest anything I wrote this year went from germination to completion was about three hours. 
Other ideas just hang around, sometimes for months, waiting for that magic spark to 
light their burner. Oftentimes an initial idea collides with a second idea and 
perhaps even a third or a fourth until suddenly a while new idea takes shape 
and the words begin to flow.  
Some stories begin with a single word, phrase or sentence, or even a picture. 
Others begin with a few key points, a paragraph or a short outline. 
And some actually just come pouring out of my fingers onto the screen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This story has an interesting story behind it, so I thought Iâ€™d share it with you. 
When I was working on my various projects on my trip to Paris for WDC last September 
I had an idea for something different from my normal writing. 
I just started typing and three pages later I had the beginning of a story 
I liked but one that I knew would require more work and time than I had at that moment, 
so I put it aside while I finished my various con reports, travelogues, etc. 
Then, when I was trying to decide what should go to which publication 
(always a task because I try to achieve some kind of balance and variety among them) 
I mentioned in an email to Doug Kent, Jim Burgess and Chris Babcock that I had one 
item left that wasn't quite finished and didn't seem to fit in with the other stuff
that I was passing out. 
Jim reminded me that he was still publishing his sub-szine <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> 
and heâ€™d be glad to publish it; this without even knowing what it was about.  
So I dropped him an email and told him Iâ€™d write something for the next <i>TAP</i>. 
Weeks went by and Iâ€™d occasionally pick up my little gem, look at it, 
think about how to finish it and then get distracted by something else. 
One day I realized that although I'd been reading <i>TAP</i> since Jim started it 
(and that was so long ago even he isn't sure of the exact date, 
but it was probably in 1983 or 1984 - so TAP is 30 years old this year!) 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Ah, and therein lies another tale...
yes, we have Peeriblah on TOP of Peeriblah, so while I told Larry off the top of my 
head it was around 1983 or 1984, I did have access both to my own records as well as
YOUR very own copy of the original issue.
This COULD be looked up.  
As you know, YOUR hobby archives followed a wayward Tim Haffey path that ended up
in the hands of Doug Kent.
And Doug has scanned large parts of those archives and posted them on the Internet.
I often spend spare hours trolling through Doug's records and my own extensive paper
archives.
The starting date for my publication for which this is the 343rd issue in thirty years,
and boy are THOSE "Thirty Miles of Bad Road"!, or about 11 and a half issues a year,
was precisely published on November 5, 1983.
In the lucky unlucky thirteenth issue of <b>North Sealth, West George</b>, the famous
noseweegie szine of Terry Tallman, did appear the first issue, which began with the
name <b>The Boob Report</b>.  
You may find that first subszine buried in the <b>NSWG</b> szine at:
http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/oldzines/nswg13.pdf.  This first issue of mine
featured one of my favorite all-time silly anecdotes that I am happy to resurrect
on its thirtieth anniversary.
I still often pass Mariani's Funeral Home in the North End of Providence when I'm
cutting across town from the north to the western part of the city, as it is on
Hawkins Street, that runs by the Rhode Island School for the Deaf and is almost the
only street in the city that makes that connection.
Anyway, thirty years ago when I did not have a car and was walking that path across
town, and this is a VERY Italian part of town as the Funeral Home's name reflects,
Mariani was doing some digging and apparent landscaping on his front lawn.
I was walking by almost every day and this project was going much of the way through that
1983 fall.  The big black dump truck that I can still see clearly thirty years
later in my mind always was parked right next to the project on the street.
But suddenly, the truck moved to a spot tucked behind the building where only
someone like me walking by would even think to notice it.  
For the rest of the project it stayed hidden in the back.
Why?
The name of the contractor, plastered on the side door and back of the big black dump truck
was "Providence Body Co."))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Larry, you also would get a kick out of that lucky thirteenth issue of <i>NSWG</i>
as it featured Terry's famous screed against "Hobby ORGANIZATION" and of course
who was one of his chief targets?
You guessed it, and I quote the Hobby Ghodfather, "I keep telling myself that I 
like Larry Peery." and later "I am designating <b>NSWG</b> as the official Muzzle
Larry Peery szine for the hobby."
The whole screed is classic Toadfather and I'm sure some of you will enjoy reading
it for yourselves.
The proximal cause was the latest in your effort at professionalizing the hobby's
organization with a 1 dollar tax on each of us players to fund all that dreaded
organization... lucky for all of us, the Diplomacy hobby remains gloriously 
disorganized.
And through it all, we've all kept telling ourselves how much we like you,
and I really do love this story that I'm interrupting, and glad to be printing it.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((But, this is the thirtieth anniversary of my 343rd issue, but you may then ask,
when did <b>The Abyssinian Prince</b> itself actually come about?
That is not a history you can track either on the <b>Pouch TAP</b> web site or on
Doug Kent's archive.
<b>TAP</b> actually began as a subszine to the <b>Boob Report</b> subszine, going
completely solo with the 100th issue of <b>The Boob Report</b>.
There were seventeen issues of <b>The Abyssinian Prince</b> in that subszine format
before going to issue #101.
I should find those back issues and make sure I or Doug get them up on the web!))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didnâ€™t know where the title <i>TAP</i> had come from or what it meant. 
So, I turned to Google and Wikipedia and did some searching. 
I expected that <i>TAP</i> had something to do with Abyssinia (e.g. Ethiopia); 
of course, but beyond that I didn't have a clue what to expect. 
I was surprised, although I shouldn't have been, knowing Jim, to learn about 
Dr. Johnson's "The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, that reminds me I need to read it again and it has been at least a year.
I know of no book that rewards frequent re-reading so masterfully.
I used to have the elegant opening sentence as the masthead quote here, so 
most of you have seen it. 
But it is just SO good.
"Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with eagerness 
the phantoms of hope, who expect that age will perform the promises of youth, 
and that the deficiencies of the present day will be supplied by the morrow, 
attend to the history of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia."))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wonâ€™t go into Dr. Johnsonâ€™s work or its importance. You can find all that online 
for yourself. I will, however, share the results of one bit of research I did as 
I traced the story behind the work. According to various sources Dr. Johnson 
wrote the piece in 1759 to help cover the costs of his mother's funeral. 
For his weekâ€™s efforts Dr. Johnson was paid a total of 75 pounds for the copyright. 
The question that popped into my head was what kind of funeral can you buy for 
75 pounds? Further research revealed that 75 pounds in 1759 would be worth about 
USD 15,600 in 2013, and that the average USA funeral in 2013 cost between 
USD 8,000 and 10,000 and the average UK funeral in 2013 cost about 7,622 pounds 
or USD 12,271; so Dr. Johnson did quite well by his mother. 
And the amount of money he was paid at the time for the time he spent on the project 
suggests that he was doing very well as a writer. 
And, on your next trip to London you can stop by Dr. Johnson's house in Gough Square, 
visit the delightful museum there and then walk down Fleet Street 
(once the home of the London newspaper industry) toward St. Paul's. 
There at the foot of Lodgate Hill (the highest point in The City of London) 
is where Lodgate Street once stood. 
It's gone now, probably destroyed in The Blitz. 
Lodgate Street was the home of W. Johnston, the printer of the original and 
second edition of Rasselas, Prince of Ethiopia. Imagine the excitement that 
April spring morning as hundreds of London's literati and glitterati gathered to 
await the release of Dr. Johnson's latest work. 
Sort of reminds me of the hundreds of people lined up to shell out their $35 
for a chance to buy a copy of Baroness Thatcher's Memoirs when she came to La Jolla, 
and a chance to tell her what a great lady she was (Something she was already well 
aware of, even if John Major wasn't.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But it wasn't Dr. Johnson or Rasselas that came to mind every time I thought of 
<i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>. Instead a picture passed before my eyes that 
I probably had first seen when I was a student in junior high school back 
in the early 1960s. It was of a funny little man, rather dark in color, 
wearing some kind of military uniform with a pith helmet standing behind a podium 
that was obviously much too tall for him. It was an old B&amp;W image. 
All I remembered was that he had come to the League of Nations to ask it to fulfill 
the promise the League had made to his country; and it had turned him away laughing at him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So now my story had a third string to go with the original idea, and Dr. Johnson 
and Rasselas - Haile Selassie, the Abyssinian Prince who became a King who became 
an Emperor, who spent twenty years after his death buried under a public toilet 
in his former imperial palace before being buried in the tomb of the royals of Ethiopia 
and hailed as a descendent of Jesus Christ by millions of believers. Yes, that 
Haile Selassie. He is the Abyssinian Prince who is the center of this story.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 THE STORY BEGINS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I could have begun this story near Harar, Ethiopia in 1892 the year the boy who 
would become Haile Selassie was born as a prince in a minor tribe with not very 
good prospects for surviving, let alone advancing in his tribal society. 
We might have picked up the story in Geneva when he first walked onto the world stage 
at the League of Nations and captured the world's attention with his words and his 
imperial bearing. Or I could have begun the story in Korea at a place called 
Pork Chop Hill where thousands of members of his Imperial Guard regiment 
had gone to fight side by side with other UN volunteers against the invaders from China.  
All of those would have been good starting spots for this story but instead I want 
to begin it in Silver Spring, Maryland in the fall of 2013.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 MAMO'S STORY

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the full story of my trip to Silver Spring and what happened at DipCon 
you'll need to look in a companion piece in the current issue of <i>DIPLOMACY WORLD</i>. 
This story focuses on something else and here I introduce the fourth thread 
that comprises this story, in the person of a man whose name I do not even know yet, 
but I am determined to find out. For now I will call him Mamo, which means my friend 
or my buddy. Mamo was my van driver at the hotel. I asked him to give me a short tour 
of downtown Silver Spring and take me to the Sarbanes Transit Center. 
Because of the rain and traffic what would normally have taken 5-10 minutes ended up 
being a bit longer, but during our short time together Mamo told me something about 
his life in America since he had come to this country with his family in the 1970s. 
At first he wouldn't say much about his parents or what had brought them to this 
country but after I spoke of my respect and affection for Haile Selassie and the 
role he had played in the development of Ethiopia and my childhood recollections 
of his speech to the League, his resistance to Mussolini's fascist invasion, 
and Ethiopia's standing side-by-side with the Americans in Korea; 
he opened up about the horrors of what had gone on and were going on in his homeland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We both knew that Selassie has come to New York in October 1963 to speak to the 
United Nations General Assembly about one of his pet causes, "Collective Security," 
just a few months after he had brought together many of the newly independent countries in 
Africa following the tide of de-colonization that spread through Africa in the early 1960s. 
He had even brokered the founding of the Organization of African Unity or OAU as it 
was known in May of 1963 which brought together 29 countries and 150 million people 
in less than ten years. Today the African Union, one of the largest providers 
of UN peacekeeping forces, lives on as his legacy. This time he was received 
with respect and even admiration at the UN. A few days later he was greeted 
with a full state welcome at the White House by President and Mrs. Kennedy. 
Again, he was acknowledged as a man of wisdom and a world leader worthy of respect. 
A few weeks later President Kennedy was dead and Lyndon Johnson was President. 
But the new American president knew that the United States needed Ethiopia 
far more than Ethiopia needed the US, although the Emperor was struggling to 
raise the standard of living of his poor people. A series of visits to Addis Ababa 
by a string of American diplomats and warriors bringing offers of aid, 
assistance and alliance resulted in a series of agreements that gave the Americans 
what they wanted -land in Ethiopia.  For the next ten years or so these pieces 
of land centered around the Kagnew Station near Asmara Eritrea (then a part of 
Ethiopia, now a hotbed of unrest in NE Africa) were the site of many US intelligence
installations run by the armed services, the CIA, the NSA, the NRO, etc. etc. 
From their perch a few miles from the Red Sea 7,500 feet above sea level the 
listening devices of the Americans could cover a vast circle that covered the 
Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Red Sea, the Indian Sea, Turkey, the Black Sea 
and most importantly southern Russia and especially the Soviet's nuclear weapons 
and rocket testing sites. This was critical in the days when the only other 
reliable source of information the US had were its spy planes, and after Gary Powers'
U-2 fiasco under President Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson didn't want to use the U-2s 
unless it was necessary. Ten years later developments in satellites and cameras made ground-based operations like the one at Kagnew mostly obsolete although the US 
military tried to hang on to them.  One additional benefit of the location that 
made it valuable right to the end was the fact that it was located almost due south of 
Moscow near the equator which made it a perfect site to ease drop on Soviet satellite
communications (Moscow is located at 37 degrees, 37 minutes and 0 seconds East and 
Asmara is located at 38 degrees, 56 minutes and 1.68 seconds East) Valuable stuff indeed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In return for this invaluable help Selassie and Ethiopia didn't get much. 
Thereâ€™s no record that, unlike many rulers of various US allies Selassie 
ever enriched himself from American aid. Instead most of it went into basic 
improvements in the country's primitive infrastructure; although a new imperial 
palace and a giant cathedral for the nationâ€™s catholic Orthodox Church were built. 
It was in the palace that Selassie was captured and held captive by a Marist named 
Megistu in 1974. Megistu would run the Communist junta that ruled Ethiopia for 
fifteen years, then serve as president of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic of 
Ethiopia until 1991 when he fled to Zimbabwe at the end of the Ethiopian Civil War. 
Although responsible for the death of some two million people and convicted of 
genocide he remains free today.  Ironically Megistu's first name was also Haile 
and he was, in fact, named for the former emperor. Haile Selassie died under 
mysterious circumstances in 1975 and his body disappeared, only to reappear 
years later when it was found buried under a public toilet in the palace. 
Twenty-seven years later it was laid to rest with his imperial ancestors 
in the family tomb in the cathedral he had built.  
Ironically, it was also twenty-seven years that separated his speeches at the 
League of Nations and the United Nations, both in support of the same cause, 
collective security. Today, members of the Rastafarian sect, mostly in Jamaica, 
believe Haile Selassie was a direct descendent of Jesus Christ and he himself 
as quite literally a Son of God. Be that as it may he is one of the fascinating 
minor figures of the 20th century.  Perhaps he was not worthy of our worship but 
certainly, as students of diplomacy or Dippers he was worthy of our study and 
these were some of the thoughts that passed through my head as I chatted with Mamo, 
thanked him for sharing his thoughts with me, and made my way back to DipCon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With this bit of background and hopefully your interest piqued to learn more about this 
fascinating man let's use Google and YouTube to revisit some of the highlights of his 
life that I mentioned earlier. If you do I think youâ€™ll agree that he was a diplomat 
and Dipper worth studying and emulating.

 FROM ETHIOPIA TO KOREA IN SEARCH OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By now you may be wondering what all this has to do with Diplomacy? 
It's really quite simple. From the beginning Selassie believed in and practiced the 
concept of "collective security," the joining together of weaker nations to 
resist aggression by more powerful ones. He preached this at the League of Nations 
when he tried to rally it to take action against Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. 
During WWII, although in exile from 1936-1941, he returned to Addis Ababa in 1941 
to rally his people to resist the occupiers. As I pointed out he sent his own 
royal guard, the Kagnew Battalion (which is where the name for the US base came from) 
to Korea to fight with Americans and other UN members to resist the North Koreans 
and Chinese Communists. The heroism of Korean fighters was recognized at battles 
like Pork Chop Hill and some were decorated by the Americans. Hundreds of Ethiopians 
were killed and thousands injured in the fierce fighting but not one Ethiopian was 
captured by the enemy. The Ethiopians preferred to die in combat rather than face the
embarrassment of capture by the foe. One interesting footnote is that today, 
after years of civil war and abuse by a pro-Communist government, a few hundred 
members of the Kagnew Battalion still survive. Most are in the eighties, 
in ill health, and even deprived of their meager pensions. However, their bravery 
has not been forgotten. The South Korean government has sent relief supplies, 
doctors, and other aid to Ethiopia to help their former allies and when one the 
members of the Kagnew Battalion who served in Korea dies they are buried in Ethiopia's
equivalent to Arlington National Cemetery inside the cathedral that 
Haile Selassie built and just a few yards from where he is buried. 
At each burial a representative from the Korean embassy attends. 
Even as it was troubled by its own internal conflicts Ethiopia under Selassie 
continued to contribute peacekeeping forces when needed in Africa and elsewhere. 
The man practiced what he preached. As a Dipper I find the concept of 
"collective security," which one skeptic called "another name for Diplomacy with teeth."
intriguing. It offers an alternative to the "every man for himself" attitude 
that permeates most Diplomacy games. In fact, Iâ€™ve found in two recent games 
that applying the concept can be a valuable tool in waging a successful battle 
for victory. But enough on that. I donâ€™t want to give away any secrets or tools 
that might be useful in Seattle.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 THE STORY ENDS

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I began this story with a quotation from Selassie's speech at the League of Nations 
in 1936. Let me end it with a quotation from his address to the United Nations in 1963.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates:
Twenty-seven years ago, as Emperor of Ethiopia, I mounted the rostrum in Geneva, 
Switzerland, to address the League of Nations and to appeal for relief from the 
destruction which had been unleashed against my defenseless nation, by the Fascist 
invader. I spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world. 
My words went unheeded, but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning 
that I gave in 1936.
Today, I stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle 
discarded by its discredited predecessor. In this body is enshrined the principle 
of collective security which I unsuccessfully invoked at Geneva. 
Here, in this Assembly, reposes the best -â€“ perhaps the last â€“- hope for the 
peaceful survival of mankind." -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim, I'm struggling some with conference realignment.  When SU was in the Big
East I always cheered for BE teams in their out of conference games - yes,
even when Georgetown played.  Now that same philosophy means that I'm
supposed to cheer for teams like Duke and UNC - teams I don't think I've
ever cheered for before no matter who they were playing!  Of course, every
time Duke has a big game and I (sort of..) hope they win they have lost this
year.  That said, the ACC is a much better place for SU.  It is a great
basketball conference and a relevant football conference - and one in which
SU can compete with the middle teams.   The Big East basketball only schools
are in good shape and will do just fine without the football schools.  I'm
finding it hard to feel bad for UCONN as they were my least favorite Big
East school and a recruiting competitor of SU.  They are doomed to
irrelevancy now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((UConn should still find a way to keep their
Women's Basketball tradition going, but the men's basketball team is
doing well now, but will they keep it up?  And UConn football will
always be awful, one thinks.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When I mentioned UCONN's irrelevancy I was thinking of football.  
Certainly they will continue to be the premier woman's basketball team. 
Brianna Stewart played high school ball locally and is a total class act.  
Although, I think the men's basketball program will take a hit over time as well.  
There is a lot of excitement in Syracuse around this basketball season.  
I think that our #2 rank is a little high, but we are one of a dozen teams 
that could win it all.   
They have sold 3,000 more season tickets this year than last and we are 
guaranteed to lead the nation in attendance this season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, I can get into rooting for Syracuse to beat up those hated 
ACC teams, but I doubt I ever will get used to them being there.
The former Big East football teams in that American Athletic Conference
may take even more getting used to.
As I finish up typing this issue on Saturday the 28th, Syracuse is struggling
toward a victory over old rival and perhaps best team in the remaining Big
East, Villanova. 
James Bell can't do it all against this balanced Orange squad, so doesn't 
look like any Big East team will be able to challenge for the national title
at this point.
This year looks like a down year for most of the other remaining Big
East teams.  
Providence could actually be a player in the league (which will be a welcome
surprise), though their depth is horrible with two freshman sitting out for
an on-campus behavior violation and some injuries.
I really have just grown to hate college football even more since it is
messing up my basketball teams!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
SU is the only bright spot in New York state major sports.  The Islanders,
Rangers, Sabres, Jets, Bills, Giants, Knicks, Nets, and Mets are all awful.
Even the Yankees were not particularly good last season.   Tough to be a fan
of New York teams these days!

<i>((Well, sort of, but I think the Sabres are turning it around into a really nice
story.
Where early in the season they were threatening to sit a new league record
for fewest goals scored in a season, recent weeks have told a very different story.
Since December 17th, they are 3-1-1, and have scored 14 goals in 5 games, almost
three goals a game, whee!
Ted Nolan is doing a good job and I think the last few weeks are NOT a fluke.
Cody Hodgson and Matt Moulson are starting to play better and they have a good
young core.
But admittedly, that's bad if that's the best story in NY state sports at the 
moment.))</i>

1) All games in The Abyssinian Prince these days are named after Mekons

excellent starter for some press, with at least quadruple entendres
that I can think of. Anyway, I haven't updated my house rules in
"forever", so they are included in this issue too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) All but one of you gave me a preference list, so I first randomized
that person, then used the preference lists the rest of you provided
to assign the six other countries.  Everyone got at least their fourth
top choice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Ask if you have any questions.  I will give some prizes for the best
press in this game, I really think this crowd can write some great press.    
I will be writing press as well.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Keep in mind in choosing your initial moves, and I have draft moves from
many of you, that
first turn only - if at the end of the first turn (only), any square has 
5 or more cyclists on it then the square in front is treated as if were 
blank for card replacement purposes. 
When it matters, Movement Order is: A/B/C/D; highest card played that turn; 
highest card in hand.
Let me know if you have other questions about how this works.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) The name of this new game is FOR THE MEKONS ET AL., actually a song by
Will Oldham.
Press is highly encouraged, and we only have one Team Captain so far, but 
designating one can help focus the press.
That's up to you, others can add Team Captains at any time.
Some interesting teams and player names, which also should help you augment
press items.
Andy Bate has an interesting take on competitive failures, I had to go look
Roberto Rojas up, this Chilean was finally pardoned for his act, I noticed.
I have not seen any Hunger Games movies, but recognize where Rick gets his team.
My brother David, I no longer follow football of any kind, but when I was a kid
(and he is seven years younger than me, so I wonder when HE became aware of these
four) I loved Syracuse football and their great running backs. 
All four of these guys have really tremendous stories.
Andy York reprises his Alamo team, and that's always fun to remember.
The Polish names are common, well, sort of common, so there are numerous 
people who Brendan may have had in mind, more press on that will be fun.
And last, but far from least, it appears we have a Terry Pratchett fan amongst us, 
but I'm nearly positive a couple of the rest of you will get into Hank's 
team names as well.
In fact, as one of you well knows, you mined this realm for team names in 
a previous Breaking Away game.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i>
Come to TempleCon, February 7-9, 2014 here in Providence, RI!!!
This year it does NOT conflict with Super Bowl Sunday, so I hope 
we'll get more attendees, please consider coming!!!
Check out http://www.templecon.org/14/ for more details of the venue.
The TempleCon North American Grand Prix Diplomacy Tournament will again be the first of the four Nor'Easter events on the North American Diplomacy tournament circuit. Rounds will begin 6PM Friday, 9AM and 6PM Saturday, and 11AM Sunday. The ever-popular Detour scoring system will continue to be used, as well as central clock timing. Only the Sunday round will be played with time limits. Come play one round or all four!
I have a crash room reserved and word on the street is that Chris Martin may be
joining us.
Get in touch with me and come up for one of the most entertaining venues on the 
Diplomacy circuit.
I'm thinking about trying to set up to bid for DipCon in 2016, but I need to get 
a good turnout this year to set that up.
This year will be an off year for Chris' Invitational Tournament, so I'm thinking that the
next off year in two years would be a good target.
Flying into Providence is easy and very near the venue.
I now cannot make WACcon, but we're also now a few weeks distant from that DipCon event too.</b>
