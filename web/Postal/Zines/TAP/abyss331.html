<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.  
Join the tidal wave of Dippers going to 
World DipCon in Chicago in August, we can overwhelm Shark Chum with 330 warm bodies!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue establishes the continuation of the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug will keep us on schedule so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Fascinating, Marc and I will have some interesting rooting interests
if it develops this way... see below.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Commentary:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We all know that Baseball is only played in the National League.   
No funny rules (DL) or teams that just purchase championships (Yankees), 
in the Senior Circuit baseball is still pure and very difficult.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East –- This is a two team division with the Phillies continuing to 
get better and the Braves sticking in second behind them.    
The Phillies are loaded, they have pitching and offense and no one in the 
East has the horsepower to stop them.   
The Braves just keep winning, people leave, people come, Braves still win.   
They just aren't as dominant as before.   
Figure the Phillies are the odds on favorite to go to the WS... but not so fast Phils.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central -– Is becoming a 2 team division also.   
The Astros just don’t have any juice left and the Cubs are the Cubs.  
(See you next year!)  
Reds can be dangerous, but not in the league as the Cardinals and Brewers.  
The Cardinals have the starting pitching and good offense as do the Brewers.   
It'll be a dogfight just like last year, but chalk it up to El Birdo's...
they know how to win Championships... the Brewers are still learning.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West –- The Dodgers are a mess (bankruptcy does that!)   
The Rockies and D-Backs are rebuilding and the Padres are in flux.    
Only the Giants are real... they win the division.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WC Game –- Brewers over the Braves in a great game. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS –- The Cardinals host the Giants have win in a quick 4 game series.    
The Phillies and Brewers fight it out to the end.   
The Phils win on the last pitch of game 5.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS -– Another classic.  Back and forth games, but the Cardinals eke it out in 
Games 5 (home) and 6 (in Philly) to return to the WS.   
Phillies fans call for Charlie Manuel's head on a cheesesteak sandwich.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East –- Yankees pay for another $200M division championship.   
Ho hum.   The Rays end up a distant second... 
the Red Sox continue their fall from grace.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central –- Terrible division in a poor league.   
Flip a coin... Two heads come up... must be the Twins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West –- Rangers and Angels will fight it out all season.   
Albert Pujols hits 42 homers but it's not enough and the Rangers win the division.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WC -– Angels pound the Rays.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS -– Angels play long ball with the Yankees and out hit them.   
El Hombre shows that he still has a few good years left in him (but not 10 of them!)   
Rangers sweep the Twins, period.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS -– What a great series the Rangers get up early and 
the Angels come storming back.   
In Game 7 a bunt scores Alberto, who was intentionally walked in the 9th, 
and the Angels go to the series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS –- Angels/Cardinals.   Albert against his old team.   
Put up the 12th Pennant for the Cardinals... 
Albert strikes out to end the series as Wainwright throws a 1 hit game 5.

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Wed, 4 Apr 2012 10:13:44 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Creeping up on us like an old pair of Jim-Bob's underwear:  
IT'S BASEBALL SEASON!!!!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There has been a sea change in the landscape since last year, 
and it's not just because of the new playoff format.  
While the AL has been better than the NL overall for several years now, 
I don't think it's ever been this pronounced.  
Anyone over .500 might get a playoff spot in the NL.  
Anyone under .500 in the AL may get relegated to AAA.  On with the show...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Giants, Diamondbacks (WC1), Rockies, Dodgers, Padres.  I had to 
toss a coin between the top 2, but I'm happy with the call.  
The Rockies look competitive, but that means 81-81.  Dodgers not so much.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Goz prediction:  this division will set the record for 
most combined losses ever, including the years where there were 
7 teams per division.  While I will pick Milwaukee to win with 85 wins, 
that's pretty close to being under .500.  
Before anyone complains about someone being under .500 and making 
the playoffs, remember that there might only be 4 teams in the league 
*over* .500.  Over/under on the number of games that Votto plays 
for the Reds this year:  96.  Brewers, Cards, Cubs, Reds, Pirates, Astros.  
The bottom 2 lose a combined 210 games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Slightly better overall than recently, but that's damning with 
faint praise.  Philly is the class of the NL, but might not make a 
playoff spot if they were in the AL.  That said, it looks like a 
dogfight behind them, and the last 4 win from 75 to 84 games.  
Phillies, Braves (WC2) Marlins, Mets, Nats.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  Big shift here.  Angels and Rangers both win 100+, 
and might be the best two in the league.  
I'll say Angels, Rangers (WC1), Mariners, A's.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:  Detroit is the easy call.  Mediocrity after that.  
Tigers, Twins, White Sox, Indians, Royals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  One of the stranger lineups for this division in recent memory.  
I think the Yankees start slow and pick up enough speed to win the division, 
with Tampa Bay &amp; Toronto fighting for the last WC.  
The big difference between the Red Sox and the Cubs is that the 
Cubs are *loveable* losers.  The Red Sox won't even
put the "fun" in "dysfunctional".  
Yankees, Rays (WC2), Blue Jays, Red Sox, Orioles.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLWC:  Wow.  We get to guess a 1-game playoff 6 months' away.  
Arizona over Atlanta.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALWC:  Texas over Tampa Bay.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  Giants over Brewers 4-2.  Phillies over Diamondbacks 4-3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Angels over Tigers 4-1.  Rangers over Yankees 4-2.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  In an upset to make Jim-Bob happy, Giants over Phillies 4-3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Angels over Rangers 4-3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Angels sweep Giants 4-0.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 All right gents, there's your jump-start for the year.  Someone wake up Jim-Bob
and get your own picks in.

<i>((I got my actual PICKS in early, and they were published by Doug Kent
already. 
I am writing this after Detroit sweeps the Red Sox in their first series
and the Yankees seem to be having that slow start you predicted as well.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Wed, 4 Apr 2012 08:50:27)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(sigh)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, after watching Papelbon walk out the door (a decision I agreed with) and 
converting Daniel Bard to a starter, the Sox went out and got a new closer, Andrew
Bailey, who's already injured.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yup, and the Red Sox bullpen already is a mess...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anywho...I haven't kept up with baseball and I have no idea who's on 
any team any more.  But why let that stop me?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: Giants win the division.  Is anybody else good?  I don't know.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: where is the fat man now?  Hmm...I guess I'll look this up.  
Oh that's right, he went to Detroit.  Following in his father's very large footsteps.  
So, Fielder has left the Brewers and Pujols has left the Cardinals.  
The Cubs probably need a little time to get things in order.  
I'll randomly go for the Reds, since they kept their best player.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: Phillies win the division easily.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wild Cards: Well now I have to pick wild cards?  I'll go with Brewers and D-Backs

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  
Rangers win the division.  Josh Hamilton falls off the wagon again, 
but the nation forgives him because it's ok to be a drug addict if you're white.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: 
Tigers win the central.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  
Yankees win the division with ease, because they have $1.50 to spend for 
$1.00 that their nearest competitor can spend.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wild Cards: Angels and Red Sox

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Wild Card: Brewers over D-Backs

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALWC: Red Sox over Angels

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  
Giants over Brewers, Phillies over Reds.  
I'm not going to pick the number of games.  
Picking the teams is silly enough at this point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS: 
Red Sox over Tigers.  Rangers over Yankees

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  
Phillies over Giants

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  
Rangers over Red Sox

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  
Phillies over Rangers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other predictions:
Prince Fielder puts on so much weight that he develops a 
gravitational field strong enough to have his personal moon.
Derek Jeter hits .255 with an OPS of .635, and still 
makes the All-Star team because he's "a winner."
Justin Verlander pitches two perfect games, but faces criticism 
because he doesn't have a World Series ring. 
WFAN listeners tell radio hosts that Pettite is better because he's "clutch."
Stephen Strasburg goes 12-1 with a 1.34 ERA in the first half, 
driving Nats fans crazy as the team limps to a 25-56 first half.  
Then his arm falls off.  
Joe Morgan and Tim McCarver have an open feud about who has the 
most obscure stories to tell today's young listeners, 
who have no idea what they are talking about and do not recognize 
any of the players that they mention. 
McCarver wins when he brings up Warren Spahn.  
The Rays eat chicken and drink beer in the clubhouse all season long and nobody cares.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Way cool, Rick, I agree with all your other predictions.
I did get my actual picks published before, but here is some more detail.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: Boston Red Sox, Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays,
Baltimore Orioles.
This is the year that Toronto and Baltimore stay in the race much longer.
The Yankees pitching falls apart at the beginning and end of the season,
and they COULD slip even further, especially as Jeter gets slower and slower
and slower, and A-Rod gets less and less "clutch" in his hitting. 
The Red Sox have a horrible start to the season (I was predicting that even
before they actually did...) but then Bobby Valentine eventually shows that
he can do more than invent wraps, build sports bars, do New York media shows
while managing in Boston, make more commercials than any other individual sports
person in America, and wipe his brow as he scowls at his team.
Andrew Bailey WILL come back before the end of the season, just in time.
And the Red Sox will start winning as soon as everyone dismisses them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central: Detroit Tigers win going away, they likely will win the most games
in baseball.  
They also may score the most runs, and challenge the magic 1000 mark.
Prince will gain weight, but still hit.
Cleveland Indians, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox, and Kansas City Royals
bring up the rear, but beat each other up enough so that no one challenges for
the wild card.
Wins the challenge cup for most boring division in baseball.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West: The Angels from whatever city they're from have the best rotation in
baseball and will show it throughout the season and playoffs.
They will battle with the Texas Rangers, though, for the division all year and 
stay sharp, sharper than Detroit.
Since everyone's finally forgotten the Seattle Mariners exist, they will be in
a three way dogfight all season, but don't have the horses.
The Oakland A's will start to wonder if Billy Beane is a genius any more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two Wild Cards: Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: I know it is a sacrilege, but I really don't pay much attention
to the NL, except for my favorite team, the Giants.  The Phillies either
are seen as juggernauts or fatally flawed, I fall in the middle, they win
the division, then make a charge and fall short just as they convince everyone
they have something.
Atlanta Braves, Florida Marlins, Washington Nationals, and New York Mets bring up 
the rear.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central: St. Louis Cardinals, with Milwaukee Brewers VERY close behind.
No one else matters much, but Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, 
and the truly horrid Houston Astros end up at the rear and go for 120 losses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West: My San Francisco Giants have the best pitching and it will show over the
season, the Colorado Rockies will surprise and finish second.
Arizona Diamondbacks will fade at the end, the Los Angeles Dodgers will finish
strong and no one will care what happens to the San Diego Padres.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two WCs: Milwaukee, Colorado.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Playoffs: I go with Rick's new model, I might pick games when we get closer, but
it is silly now.  Rays win WC match.  Boston Red Sox and Angels win the
Division Series games, Angels go on to win AL.
Milwaukee wins WC match in the NL.  Then St. Louis and the Phillies win the
Division Series games and the Phillies win the NL pennant.
The Angels win the World Series with their brilliant pitching, but the World
Series has stunning pitching and actually is worth watching.</i>

1) The FGR draw proposal was rejected again and is reproposed, 
please vote with your fall orders.
Remember that if you aren't voting, you are vetoing the draw.
I'm holding this game partly because I'm missing lots of orders,
and partly because I want everyone to please vote on the draw, you 
can veto it, but most people have just not been voting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We now have two medical replacements, as Buddy's son Jim (who some of us played with 
many years ago as James Alan) will be playing for Buddy as Eric is playing for Terry. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN): Whoever is vetoing the F/G/R draw, please show yourself 
so we can eliminate you and end the game.  
The original surviving players (Iverson &amp; Ozog) 
no longer wish to be subjected to this torture 
(well, I can't speak for Ken, but you get the idea).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ALL): Is Ken Iverson in this game? 
See how confused everyone is??
Anyway, I'm holding this and will more directly poll people on the FGR
to see if we can get things clear.
BUT, if someone is vetoing, I'm not telling who it is.

<b>1999D (Secrets) Endgame Statement: Bruce Linsey (Turkey, standby)</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm writing this mostly from memory, so considering the state thereof (and
the fact that I was in the game for over a decade of real time!), it will be
rather vague and hopefully fairly accurate in some places. I'm also copying
the other surviving players, so that they can comment on this if they like.
This was my final postal Diplomacy venture; I am now officially a retired
old hobby fart. Here are a few miscellaneous recollections from this game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I took over a strong Turkish position in 1906. The country had been allied
with Russia, and I tried to continue that. I proceeded to finish off a
helpless Italy and made an agreement with Mike Barno's one-center Germany that
I'd let him survive till the end if he would cooperate with me. He kept the
agreement beautifully and had lots of fun prancing around behind my front
lines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unfortunately the Russian position seemed to be manned by a series of guys
who kept corking off or otherwise vanishing, making lasting cooperation
difficult.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game came close to ending in, I think, the mid-1910s due to a stalemate
line that never quite gelled. I recall that Jim-Bob kept emitting rumblings
about there needing to be some sign of movement, which I kept trying
desperately to provide without upsetting the precarious balance of power on the
board. Someone kept proposing 4- and 5-way draws; I kept vetoing all
game-ending proposals, including an eventual proposed concession to me, 
as I hungered for a board victory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the height of stalemania, I actually considered drawing back from the
line and letting the other side break through, then trusting that my limited
negotiational skills would succeed in breaking up the opposition while Turkey
was still viable, all in the hope that I might get a second chance to
weasel my way into an 18-center win. The obvious risk was that I wouldn't break
them up, which would have led to my demise. Luckily, it never got to that
point (my deliberately collapsing the line), but it was close.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Eventually I managed to persuade Russia to concentrate on England and leave
me alone, in exchange for which I promised to make sure the game would end
with him in second place. Then communication picked up with Roland's France,
and I told him that as the game's only original player, he deserved to
survive to the end, though I needed some of his supply centers for the win.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The going was slow, excruciatingly so at times, but I tried to play
patiently, and negotiated hard and consistently. Bob Osuch took over Russia and
was, I think, wary of me; but ultimately he and I did work well together. Once
Russia finally finished off England, I was working with everyone on the
board - sort of a 4-way alliance with no opposition. At that point, probably
around 1920 or 21, I started to formulate a plan for how I'd like the game to
finish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My plan, which could have backfired in numerous ways, developed gradually.
I marched painstakingly to 17 centers, as I gently requested just the right
moves from the other players so that they'd be in position for the big
moment. (A side note here: I was aware all along that if the three of them got
together and cooperated against me, they could stop my win. But no one seemed
to have enough enthusiasm for the game to pull off such a coup; and Mike and
I had worked closely together for so long that I felt sure he'd stay
loyal.) The biggest threat wasn't that they'd all turn on me, but that someone
(possibly me!) would just carelessly screw up a move. I worked hard to ensure
that didn't happen. I'm sure that Roland and Bob probably thought me a pest
by game's end.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So with the help of three cooperative allies and a large dose of good
fortune, I got the ending I wanted: an 18-center win on the same turn that three
other powers each grabbed one of my home centers (France got SMY, Russia got
ANK, and Germany got CON). Definitely a sweet way to wrap up my fun little
stay in this hobby. I also have to add that not once did I stab or deceive
anyone to get this result. Everyone in the game knew all along exactly what
was going on, what I had promised to whom, and what I was building toward.
With patient, steady negotiation, there's almost no limit to what one can
accomplish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's fair to say that Turkey was the strongest power on the board when I
took over, so most of the credit for the win has to go to the original player,
whose name I don't recall ever knowing. Still, this was satisfying.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks, Bob Mike and Roland. I enjoyed working with you all. And thank you,
Jim-Bob, for running this game. Betcha didn't have any inkling what would
happen when you let me in!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Thanks, Bruce, for writing this detailed endgame statement.  
As you may or may not be aware, this outcome, conducted with negotiation rather
than stabbing, is usually referred to as an "Edi Birsan solo", since Edi
is one of the proponents of it as the ideal path to victory.
It really takes "diplomacy" to pull it off.
Since this game started in 1999, and ended in 2011, it was one of the longest
games in time as well as game years in history.
Thanks to all for participating!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) So far, Andy York is the only one interested in another game of this??
I'd like to get six again.  I will note this for one more issue like this,
before putting a call just at the front of the subszine.

For the last word this time, I'm going to fill up pages with press from the 
game Iliad that was played in <i>Europa Express</i> near the end of <i>EE</i>'s

This game was distinctive since it had at least one player who at other times
published and played under a pseudonym and another publisher who WAS playing
under a pseudonym.
If you think I'm going to tell you now which is which, you don't see the point
of what I'm doing.

[THE BOOB LEAVES PROVIDENCE, BOUND FOR THE PROMISED LAND]-(Via Germany). 
The Boob visits his favorite crooked travel agent to seek the cheapest way 
to Memphis. 
The following exchange occurs. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm sorry Mr. Boob, I can't get you to Memphis for less than $3,422.98 
plus tax... round trip.
"
"But... but... but..., I can fly on Eastern night coach to Seattle for 
$98 out of Boston through Houston, how come it's so expensive to get to Memphis, 
the Boob pleads plaintively."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Basically, because no one in the1r right mind wants to go anywhere <b>near</b> Memphis. 
People refuse to layover there for even five minutes," the agent sniggered. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Elvis Presley's mansion is there," the Boob volunteered hesitantly. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"See? There, you go!" exclaimed the overage hipp1e exultantly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hey, man, get serious. 
They've even got a real nice hotel to stay in with live ducks...
real cute ones... that's where I want to stay!" asserted the Boob. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Exactly! A hick town with a barnyard in the middle of the1r so-called luxury hotel. 
You think that's bad, don't even <b>mention</b> Little Rock, Arkansas. 
That would cost you a coup1e thou more!" the unflustered balding agent with his 
hair combed from the sideburn over the top of his head, flapped. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Boob's intelligence really was insulted now! 
He stormed out of the agent's office screaming, "You are the worst travel agent 
in the universe. 
The longest trip you've ever booked is from ear to ear on Long Hairways!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Memphis to the Boob] Am y'all insultin' our glorious Peabody Hotel,

How do you think we get our kicks here?! 
Now for the Virgin.... 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jerry Lucas had this other continuing series in Iliad on "the Virgin", 
but I don't want to start quoting that here, since I'm almost out of room.
Next time, I'll also pick up some of the Virgin press, probably my favorite 
installment by Jerry Lucas from Europa Express #38.  You can go look if you like.
