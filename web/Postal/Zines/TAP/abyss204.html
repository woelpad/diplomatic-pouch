This one's growing on me....

<p>
<p><br><p><br>First up, I have an announcement about the Breaking Away game opening.
The game's designer, John Harrington, will be playing and if he doesn't
win, he will give the winner a free copy of the game!
Come on, you don't need to own the game to play.
I want some people to join this game or I'll cancel all my other game
openings and just run the szine to a fold (these threats seem to garner
attention and action).
The game will cost you nothing except a commitment to play.
I'll publish the full rules again next issue.

<p>
Now, I get to the ``boring stuff''.
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous

That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 26 May 1998 19:12:41 GMT)</b>

<p>
Just got back from WDC.
The individual winner was Chris Martin, who had a solo win as England.  
John Quarto also had a nice Turkish solo.
Internet players did pretty well as a whole.

<p>
<b>Manus Hand</b>: Chris, John, and I (three of the top 5) are e-mailers, 
all there directly or indirectly because of <i>The Pouch</i>.  
Simon Szykman came 14th, and I believe there were some other e-mailers 
who ranked between my 5 and Simon's 14.

<p>
Yeah, I finished in 11th and Vincent Mous finished in 12th.  Maybe a
couple more.  (Was trying to figure out a way to get in a bit of
bragging!)  This was by far the most success I've ever had in a FTF
setting.  10-center Russia (3-way draw), 11-center France (3-way
draw), and 15-center Austria(4-way draw :( ) in the first 3 games.  In
my fourth game (Germany) I needed a 2-way draw or big 3-way draw for
the game not to be dropped, but when my French ally stabbed me I
abandoned the home for some Russian SCs which led to a 6-way draw with
only England eliminated.  Mark Franchesia, the French player, would
have won the overall championship had he won the game.  He ended up
taking a lot of flak for finishing with 16 SCs in a 6-way draw, which
I enjoyed immensely.

<p>
It was unfortunate.  I met many people for the first time and could
not hope to spend much time with any, except for those who I got to
play with.

<p>
<i>((I did really want to go to World DipCon and was sorry I didn't make it;
however, I don't really enjoy tournament cons anywhere near as much as
I enjoy more relaxed cons.  The great memories (the deep belly laughs)
always came at housecons. Still, I'm sorry I didn't get to meet Rick again
and Manus for the first time!!))</i>

<p>
Well, since we were at DixieCon, it didn't really have the feel of a
`big con' like Avaloncon did, and like I imagine Origins does.  I
liked it a little better than a tiny con where I have to face the same
guys in game after game.

<p>
<i>((Rick is running the demo game ``pouchtoo'' that picked up many
of the players from ghodstoo.
And although Manus is in pouchtoo, the two players you ``lost" from ghodstoo
obviously did really well!! (Fassio and Birsan).  I don't know the winner
but John Quarto vonTivadar, Mark Fassio and Edi Birsan definitely would be 
in my top five of players I have ever played with (I don't have the honor 
of playing in a game with Manus yet!).))</i>

<p>
I (unfortunately or fortunately?) did not have the pleasure of playing
in any games with John, Mark, or Edi.  I did get lunch the first day
with John and got the definite impression that he'd be a great FTF
player.  He said we'd met at an Incident, but that was a few years ago
and I don't have a clear memory.  Chris, the overall winner, has that
same feel.  I played a game with him last year at AvalonCon.  He's the
kind of guy who looks like he was on debate teams for 10 years.

<p>
<i>((Good job!  Gotta stop those winners!!  John Quarto is one of the
best players I've ever seen at manufacturing a win against good
players.  Analytical, persuasive, personable.  Hey, how come we
didn't get him in one of these demo games!?))</i>

<p>
Well, let's add him to the list!

<p>
<i>((Still, I'm glad the E-Mailers did well.  I might get an assist for pushing
John Quarto into going, even though I didn't go.  I think of John as first
and foremost a FTF player.  He plays a LOT by FTF.))</i>

<p>
John gets credit as somebody whose name I've been seeing in email
circles for years.  But I can definitely see dropping him in the FTF
bin.  He doesn't play the same kind of game that Vince, Simon, and I
play, if you know what I mean.  (Please don't press me for details,
I'm not sure I know what I mean.)

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
Then, I'm going to set a slate of 20 or so and DEMAND votes from
you out there.
I may get a bit obnoxious on that score as the great freedom to work and play
will generate a responsibility to offer some opinions as we near the end of
the century.
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English.

<p>
This issue, I took as my first task to select the best George Gershwin 
party song of all time.
This was really, really difficult.
I went back and forth and finally decided to choose ``I Got Plenty O' Nuttin' ''
from <i>Porgy and Bess</i>.
Gershwin probably wrote better love songs than this, but the essence of
black folk music here and the party down spirit is best epitomized by
this song.
Naturally, I must have Ella Fitzgerald singing it on the classic 1957
concert recording with Louis Armstrong blowing trumpet on Verve.
The composition of the stompin' tune builds with the tune played through
three times.
The first time Louis plays it on trumpet, then he sings it with that
distinctive voice, and finally Ella gives it that perfect rendition
that only she can do.
As most of you probably are becoming aware, 1998 is Gershwin's centennial
and there are lots of tributes going on this year, so in case anyone forgot
how essential Gershwin was to 20th Century popular music they will be 
reminded.
I already had decided that this song had to be in here.
You have to remember what an essential musical event it was when you had 
a Jewish guy write this black jazz opera (and it really is opera!) that
had just plain dancable party tunes.
Then, Ella of course is just such a sublime singer of this song.
It hesitates, it rocks, it swings, it gets to the heart of the inanity
that is the party song - yet it has deep meaning.
I'd actually appreciate it if anyone wanted to argue the choice of this
song and would rather choose another Gershwin.
There are some GREAT choices that I am necessarily leaving out, but
I won't name them.
It's up to you if you want to argue with me.

<p>
While we're thinking black jazz, the other essential party song here
must be Billy Strayhorn's composition for Duke Ellington, ``Take the
A Train''.
What I'm looking for are songs that transcend their genre or style and
speak to people directly in their dancing feet.
It is nearly impossible to say more about Ellington or this song that
would make sense.
As Benny Green has said, ``Duke is really not much use to the writer 
on Jazz.
There is nothing adequate to say about his music and it would be indulging
in extreme literary bad taste to keep floundering with superlatives.''
I won't try either.

<p>
Lastly, Frank Sinatra won some people's Dead Zone games for them in
going to join Ellington and Gershwin in the greatest band of all.
What Sinatra song goes on this list.
I have no doubt that it's ``New York, New York''.
Surely not his best pure song, surely way overexposed, but definitely
his best party song!
He also did a great song about ``Chicago'' - there is ``My Way'' naturally,
and there is ``Strangers in the Night'' and all manner of other songs.
Still, for what I'm hunting, ``New York, New York'' is it.
That song was really big in the late '70's and early '80's.
As a trivia question, what disco song about the Big Apple vied with
Sinatra for possession of the City during that same period?
Does anyone think that song or some other song should be the song
in this list about the Greatest City in the World?  

<p>
So, that adds three more songs to the list.
I intend to have a lot of fun with this, and hope all of you do too.
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
It will make a great New Millenium party tape.

<p>
Two quickie reviews and a comment for this issue before I turn 
things over to you.
First, the Mekons have a new album out, I'm even a bit slow in reviewing
it for all of you!
How could I do that to you??
Also, as long as we were talking about the general failure of crossover
music, I want to cite two recordings that epitomize the best of crossover
music... in each case talented classical musicians hook up with talented
popular artists and make classical music with real spark.
One is brand new, the other is ten years old.

<p>
First, the Mekons.
There is no doubt about it, <i>Me</i> is a very, very hard album that shows
the influence of working with Kathy Acker the last few years.
As they put music around Kathy Acker's sexually explicit and militant
verses, their own musical ideas naturally strayed to the same subjects.
This record is the result of that natural inclination.  
While it is riveting music, it's not pleasant, easy listening stuff.
Yet, it is an example of why this is still the world's greatest rock band.

<p>
Last issue, I started to make some comparisons to Sonic Youth and ran
out of time.
I'm not sure I have enough time to make my points this issue either,
but let me say this.
When rock bands ``make it'' and no longer live in the grime, dirt, and
uncertainty of an underclass life, they simply can't really make rock
music any more.
It has been argued by some rock critics that Sonic Youth are the exception
that proves the rule.
I disagree.
Corporate or crowd pleasing rock music can still be worth quite a bit, yet
it will never be the transcendent experience that comes from singing out of
real faith in the face of daunting uncertainty.
Sonic Youth are not bad, but they aren't anywhere near where a band like the
Mekons are, and they never will be.

<p>
Yet, this also does not mean that the Mekons always make great transcendent
music.
They certainly don't.
<i>Me</i> is a good example of the chances that a great rock band takes,
their successes and their excesses.
They take the sexual explicitness down a road with both subtlety and a hammer
far beyond anything I've ever heard on record that still hangs together as a
musical entity.
I don't count the ``shock'' boys like G.G. Allin, nothing here is purely
for shock value.
I honestly believe that hanging out with Kathy Acker took them on a journey
whose straightforward retelling leads them here.
Most of the record, like ``Whiskey Sex Shack'', ``Come and Have a Go If You
Think You're Hard Enough'', and ``Enter the Lists'' do transcend their
subjects to be great songs on their own.
There's a silly humor here when you ``pick up a map and look gorgeous''.
And ``what it is (definitely) don't come in a bottle''
(and they must have recorded this before Viagra actually came out...). 
For other songs, like ``Tourettes'',
at the least I found it difficult to get by their dark, dirty ugliness
to the meat underneath, even as I intellectually could see it.
To see where all this springs from, <i>Me</i> must be seen as part of a
piece with that last record with Kathy Acker.
Still, after I listened to it a few times, it kept growing on me.
And the denseness and composition of the music in places is the
best they've ever done, such as the instrumentals in ``Mirror''
that are totally hypnotic.
I'll let you know what I finally think of it at the end of the year.
If any of you are trying the Mekons for the first time, I still would
start with the Original Sin CD that includes all of <i>Fear and Whiskey</i>,
still their best and most essential album.

<p>
Ghod has teamed up with his old friend Philip Pickett to record some striking
16th Century English virginal keyboard tunes.
The start was some research by Philip Pickett and Sharona Joshua into this
music and they discovered catchy tunes, sexy harmonies, and foot stomping
rhythms.
Enter Richard Thompson, Dave Pegg, Simon Nicol, and Dave Mattacks.
Result: WOW!
Leaping off the keyboard to these multi-instrumental versions already
naturally brings them out of the dusty old bones where they have been
buried for the last few centuries (while classical music has more or
less ignored them).
They call the album perversely enough, <i>The Bones of All Men</i>.
Nope, no bones here!
Go out and grab this sucker!!
It illustrates what happens when an open minded guy like Pickett
(who, of course, already has done his English folk thing with the
Albion Band twenty years ago or so) reaches out to some old folk
pals when he sees the opportunity to make some real fine listenin'
tunes.

<p>
Brad quite correctly mentioned Wynton Marsalis' classical work as
a perfect example of what great music can come from first class
musicians in other genres when they take up classical pieces.
One of my favorite Marsalis classical records is his collaboration
with Raymond Leppard and the English Chamber Orchestra doing
<i>Baroque Music for Trumpets</i>.
They ``cheat'' and also play Michael Haydn's Concerto for Trumpet and
Orchestra, but who cares?
Marsalis is silky and sexy and Leppard keeps the orchestra rock solid
on for Wynton to wrap himself around.
More than that, through the magic of recording technology, Wynton
plays ALL the solo trumpet parts (up to eight layers in Biber's
Sonata for 8 Trumpets and Orchestra).
More than being a complicated technical exercise (making for fascinating
liner notes!), the result is the liveliest versions of the Haydn, 
Telemann's B Flat Major Concerto for Three Trumpets and Orchestra, 
and Vivaldi's C Major Concerto for Two Trumpets and Strings I've 
ever heard.
And the hackneyed Pachebel Canon gets a jaunty treatment that shouldn't
be missed!
This was a 1988 recording but well worth tracking down.
Now to Conrad von Metzke's take on Eric Brosius' Beethoven question....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Conrad von Metzke (Sat, 9 May 1998 15:37:50 -0700)</b>

<p>
Assuming you have not already dealt with your Beethoven situation, I would
suggest as my no. 1 choice the second of the two complete editions by
Wilhelm Kempff on Deutsche Grammophon 429306-2.  The copyright date is
1965 - don't be put off by that, sound is superb.   Price about $75 (my
local Tower has it marked $71.91 plus tax).  It meets your criteria very
well, and has the added benefit of being one of the ``great Beethoven moments
in recording history."  But do check date and catalogue number carefully, as
you do not want to get Kempff's earlier (early 50s) earlier run-through -
fanatics consider the earlier one superior, but the sound is less clear.

<p>
Have been trying to send an extended version of this, discussing many of the
available choices, but my computer keeps freezing on me and I haven't been
able to get the messages finished.  Will keep trying.  Will now send this
``basic" version before something happens.

<p>

<center>Conrad, metzke of incom.net</center><br>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Conrad von Metzke (Fri, 15 May 1998 05:41:19)</b>

<p>
Sorry for long silence, My computer is still having convulsions.  It is
again in the shop and this is the old one speaking....

<p>
Anyway.  In the short version of the message I suggested as a top version
of the B. sonatas the 1965 recordings by Wilhelm Kempff.  Deutsche
Grammophon 429306-2, approx. $75.  Since then I've done more looking and
researching, and talked to some people, and listened to a few things.  I
have not changed my mind.  But there are some other possibilities worth a
mention, and some things to steer you very clear of.

<p>
First, let me recommend three versions to AVOID.  

<p>
(1)  Artur Schnabel,
EMI.  These are among the great classic recordings of this music - they
have been issued at times in a ``Great Recordings of the Century" series,
and in this case that is absolutely accurate.  They are stunning.  Even
now.  Sixty years after they were first issued on 78 rpm discs....and
that last fact is of course the problem, the sonics are just not going to
work for your purposes of being able to hear everything clearly.  You
can't.  Electronic wizardry goes only so far.  Moreover, Schnabel was of
the Grand Romantic Tradition that was, shall we say, very flexible with
matters of tempo and dynamics - not at all comparatively straighforward
as you've indicated you prefer.  

<p>
(2)  Paul Badura-Skoda, Camerata. 
Easily identified by the fact that, except for the names Beethoven and
Badura-Skoda, everything printed on the album is in Japanese.  You aren't
likely to find this esoteric import anyway, but if you do, skip it. 
Badura-Skoda has used an 1825 piano to record a so-called ``period
performance," and for all its musical and historical interest, it won't
accomplish what you want it to - the instrument is just too different. 

<p>
(3)  The ``other" Kempff, also DGG.  I've recommended his 1965 edition;
this other one dates from about a dozen years earlier, and fanatics think
it's even better - but the sonics just aren't good enough to to the job
you want (and further, it costs $20 more than the '65 set for some
inexplicable reason).  On the '65, the copyright/issue date is on the
back of the box in tiny letters at the very bottom under the contents
listing.  

<p>
Now some other things:  These are the other sets known to me in current
circulation, with my thoughts based on having now heard at least some of
all but one of them:

<p>
Daniel Barenboim:  Well, I'm not sold on this set.  He's too heavy for my
taste, too - well, almost turgid at times.  I love Barenboim, and I love
him most of all as a pianist, but for some reason not in this set.  In
his defense, though, he is the model of clarity and technical quality.

<p>
Richard Goode - Rave reviews by some, lots of grumbles by others as too
eccentric.  This is the one I haven't heard, but I do know Mr. Goode's
work in Schubert, and frankly I find him rather dull.  But again, he is a
stunning player from the technical point of view.

<p>
Murray Perahia - I'm honestly confused by catalogue listings about
whether in fact Perahia has actually issued the whole set - if so, it's
apparently a bunch of single discs and not a boxed set.  If I were going
to send you anywhere but Kempff, this would be where I'd tilt.  His
Beethoven is my kind of Beethoven - slightly restrained, thoughtful,
lovingly and clearly played, never EVER eccentric.  

<p>
Alfred Brendel - Rather the opposite of Perahia, forceful and explosive
and deeply Romantic, very much in the tradition (though less blatantly)
of Schnabel, with whom Brendel studied.  This is ``gutsy" Beethoven but I
think you'll find it won't meet your needs of clearly-presented,
``straightforward" approach.

<p>
John O'Conor - He's an Irishman, and a firebrand.  This is the most
virtuoso, most flamboyant Beethoven I've ever heard in my life, fast and
driving and every single note stunningly individualized.  Everyone should
hear this - but I dare you to learn anything from it, you'll be out of
breath and blinded by trying to follow his fingerwork.  Personally, I
think he has twelve fingers and isn't telling us.

<p>
Jeno Jando - an interesting possibility for you to consider.  There is no
boxed set, rather ten single volumes on the budget Naxos label, and the
set includes the half-dozen early sonatas that aren't counted in the
published 32.  The tendency has been to ridicule Jando as a ``low'budget"
unknown on a low-budget label, but I find him considerably better than
these 'facts' would suggest.  Of all of these pianists, he is probably
the most literally faithful to the scores (except the ``period"
Badura-Skoda, of course, which is literal to the point of slavish), and
although Naxos' sound can be a little edgy at times, a slight twist of
the treble knob clears that up quite nicely.  (You have to do the same
for Kempff anyway, considering the '65 date of taping.)  Your only real
problem would be finding a shop that has all ten volumes in stock on the
same day - Tower in Boston might, but otherwise?  Note, Naxos are usually
kept by themselves in their own rack rather than mixed with all the other
stuff.  At $7 a disc, the `budget' set actually is about the same price
as the Kempff '65.

<p>
I gather from the catalogue listings that there are at least a couple of
other sets out there, but these are by people unknown to me, so there
isn't a lot of purpose in guessing at a recommendation.

<p>
I do hope this is of use.  In truth, with most of the sets above, you
won't be going wrong; most of my qualifications are at most slight tilts,
``gray area" things to keep in mind.  The fact is that there is not one
single set in the bunch that wouldn't be of great value to you, save only
the AVOIDS for the reasons given.  (And to be fair, even the earlier
Kempff isn't really a true `avoid,' it just seems stupid to pay more for
a version that will do less of what you want it to.)

<i>((Conrad's completeness overwhelms my ability to comment as
comprehensively.
Conrad's probably right about Brendel for the purpose you want, but
it is a damned fine recording!
Perahia's versions are the only other ones I know very well of the
ones he mentions.
My other recording is an incomplete boxed set of Ashkenazy on London.
It's also a stunning interpretation that doesn't meet your needs for
that reason, yet perhaps it does merit a listen - especially his
interpretation of #29 ``Hammerklavier'' - even if you can't play
it the way he does.
I like Brendel better than Perahia for myself, though you must remember
that I am not much of a Beethoven connoisseur (or much of a Romantic
classical fan at all).
When I do listen to Beethoven I usually am looking for his restrained 
Romantic side and that's what I hear when I listen to Brendel.
It shows you how point of view is everything in classical music.
On the other hand, Conrad and I agree completely about Havergal Brian's
brilliant Gothic Symphony that I intend to write about next....
but not this issue.
I only have one of Perahia's single discs and I think Conrad may be
right that it never has been compiled into a complete set.
You realize that you must report back what you bought and what YOU
thought of them, and how they helped or didn't help your playing!))</i>

As sort of a response to Pete Duxon's letter, I am sending you a compilation
tape called ``Calvert's Celtic Collection, vol. 1."  I made this tape from CDs
I had on hand at home and it was for putting in raffle baskets at SCA events
(Calvert is my name in the Society).  The tape includes:

<p>
``Gentle Breeze'' - Eileen Ivers

<p>
``Iain Ghlinn' Cuaich'' - Capercaillie

<p>
``Caoineadh Cu Chulainn'' - Davy Spillane

<p>
``There Was A Lady'' - Relativity

<p>
``Broken Wings'' - Cherish the Ladies

<p>
``Outlaws'' - Capercaillie

<p>
``Oran'' - Capercaillie

<p>
``The Wexford Carol'' - The Night Heron Consort

<p>
``Green Grow the Rushes Oh'' - Cherish the Ladies

<p>
``Dulaman'' - Altan

<p>
``Hi Rim Bo'' - Capercaillie

<p>
``The Carls o' Dysart''/``The Log Splitter'' - The Tannahill Weavers

``Fair Warning'' - John Cunningham

<p>
``Tae the Weaver's Gin Ye Go'' - Andy M. Stewart &amp; Manus Lunny

<p>
``Zeto'' - Wolfstone

<p>
``The Harvest'' - Eileen Ivers

<p>
``An Seanduine Doite'' - Relativity

<p>
``Beam Me Up'' - Rare Air

<p>
I chose these pieces because I thought it was a fair representation of what
Celtic artists are doing today.  The groups are from all the Celtic countries
except France and Wales.  (Capercallie, Andy Stewart, John Cunningham, the
Tannahill Weavers and Wolfstone from Scotland; Relativity, Touchstone, Davy

Jim,

<p>
Finally finished <i>TAP</i> over the week-end.  Made me feel rich to think of all 
the money I had saved not being as keen on music as you are.  Then again, 
think of all the musical experiences I have missed out on.

<p>
<i>((Yeah, you should see my music collection..... I haven't figured out yet
whether CD's or vinyl take up more volume per unit.... CD's are smaller
but fatter.  I have lots of volume of both, but still more volume in
vinyl.))</i>

<p>
There seem to be a lot of Anglophiles - at least in terms of music - among 
your readership.  Who'd have thought the Beat would still be referred to so 
often well over a decade past their hey-day?  In Britain although they were 
a successful band they always ranked behind the big 2: Madness and the 
Specials.  I wouldn't say they are forgotten but if they are remembered at 
all it is largely because they gave birth to the Fine Young Cannibals and 
one of the most irritating vocalists the world of pop has ever endured, 
namely Roland Gift.  He sings like his gums have been anaesthetised.

<p>
<i>((Correct.  I was a REALLY big Beat fan.  They did great concerts, we
especially loved how cool Sax was on stage.... none of those follow
bands were anywhere near as good.  I also loved Madness and the Specials,
but the Beat was transcendent.  The Specials have returned, of course,
with ska back on the charts.))</i>

<p>
Anyway, Dave Wakeling (guitarist/singer) with the Beat has got a new band 
called BANG! which is supposed to be more in the vein of the Beat than was 
his other band, General Public.

<p>
<i>((Yes, I remember, good to hear, I will check it out!  
They have a CD yet?))</i>

<p>
My most memorable ska moment was being downstairs at a party when they 
played ``Night Train to Cairo" by Madness.  A room full of about 40 people 
stomping away simultaneously upstairs don't half put the fear of god in you; 
I'm amazed the floorboards held out.

<p>
Jim,

<p>
I don't think BANG! have cut any records (do people still use that 
expression?) but they are playing live, more so in the States than over here 
in Blighty.  They do mostly Beat songs, plus a few BANG! originals and the 
inevitable General Public hit ``Tenderness".

<p>
On the subject of CDs and vinyl, I don't own a CD player but about 6 months 
ago after upgrading to Windows 95 it became a lot easier to listen to CDs on 
my PC so I went out and bought a few.  I resisted the temptation to 
repurchase my vinyl collection and bought a few newish albums (Merseybeast 
by Ian McNabb, Free Peace Sweet by Dodgy) and some well old (Cab Calloway, 
Duke Ellington, Little Richard).  One of these days I hope to be able to 
play a vinyl LP again but I reckon I will have to wait about three years 
before number 3 son (currently aged 4) is old enough to be trusted not to 
use them as frisbees or to jog the deck whilst a record is playing.  By then 
parts of my aged vinyl collection (The Undertones and The Rezillos anyone?) 
may well be back in fashion.

<p>

<i>((Ah yes, I love Cab Calloway too.
Have you ever seen the movie he did with all the dancers?

any bells.

<p><br><p><br><b>John Harrington (Mon, 27 Apr 1998 11:03)</b>
 
Jim,

<p>
We are now safely esconsed in our new house.  There's only 8 houses in the 
entire street and we've already met more neighbours in 3 days than we spoke 
to in 9 years at the previous house, which I suppose is the advantage of 
moving in to such a small community.

<p>
We currently have an electrician plus a carpenter-cum-handyman in the house 
making it fit for habitation - a process that entails initially making the 
house incredibly unfit for habitation.  On the Friday when we moved in the 
handyman turned the water off for a while, after which we could not get any 
water upstairs, due to an air lock.  I don't know if plumbers charge the 
same bandit rates in the USA that they do over here, but we had little 
option but to call out a plumber on Friday night, as the toilets were not 
flushing.

<p>
The ``60 minute" call-out plumber's charges were 55 pounds per half hour (or 
portion thereof), which meant if he worked 31 minutes he got paid 110 
pounds.  Fortunately for us, the 60 minute plumber took over 3 hours to 
arrive at which point we cancelled his services and waited till the Saturday 
when another plumber fixed the problem for an altogether more reasonable 60 
pounds for just over an hour's work.

<p>
<i>((We have called the emergency plumber on Thanksgiving Day when 
cooking and overusing our garbage disposal resulted in a jammed sink.
I forget exactly how much it cost ($75 for a half hour visit comes
to mind - which is close to your figure).
He said that holiday emergency rates were the way to make lots of money
really fast.
Everybody does what we did that day...))</i>

<p>
The rest of the week-end was spent in what my in-laws probably thought was a 
strange bit of role reversal; me looking after the 3 kids whilst Lin hacked 
plaster off the walls and put up shelves.  Lin thanked me this morning for 
doing an excellent job.  Hell, that's the sort of ``job" I could get used to 
- it does not get much better than playing football over the park with a 
bunch of kids and one or two other indulgent adults.  I noted, in passing, 
that the Asian father over the local park had brought a cricket bat and ball 
to keep his sons amused - cricket in England is hardly played at all by 
children now outside of public (i.e. fee paying) schools, although a gradual 
increase of indoor cricket clubs may reverse this trend.  Such is the way 
nowadays; it used to be that you turfed your kids out the front door and 
they made their own sport, whether it be games of cricket (using a lampost 
as a wicket, or with a wicket painted on a wall) or football or war games. 
Nowadays you pack the kids in to the family estate car and drive them from 
an indoor cricket centre, thence to a football workshop, thence to an indoor 
adventure playground.

<p>
Continuing the theme of community, I was out with the kids on Sunday and 
stumbled across a St. George's Day parade by the Scouts movement (beavers, 
cubs, scouts, brownies, girl guides, sea scouts, etc.)   In England, we 
celebrate St.George's Day with about the same enthusiasm with which we would 
greet the prospect of washing our hair in a bucket of warm spit.  On the 
other hand, many of us celebrate St. Patrick's Day with gusto because, as 
someone explained to me last Thursday (St. George's Day), St. Patrick is the 
patron saint of getting legless.  St. George, on the other hand, is 
associated with retired major-generals and Nazi nutters from the British 
movement.  Still, it matters not that we do not celebrate St. George's Day 
in any great way (other than vicariously through our children's involvement 
in the Cub Scout movement), because it's through rituals like playing 
football in the park with our kids on a sunny Sunday afternoon (with the 
raincoats nearby) that we celebrate being English.

``relegation" races at the end of the year in ``football" are such
a big deal.  The way I see it, if you're at the bottom of a Division,
you'd be better off dropping down, rebuilding and possibly winning
a championship at a lower Division, and then ``roaring" up into a
higher division on a roll after building a winning attitude.  As
I look at our larger leagues, I wish some teams had this ``opportunity".
I expect that otherwise, teams slog around in the bottom of a
particular division, just barely avoiding relegation, for years
with no hope of improvement and just the goal of not being relegated.
The sense I get is that the world ends when you're relegated.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>John Harrington (Thu, 14 May 1998 11:55)</b>

<p>
Jim,

<p>
Ah, relegation.  There's lots I could say about relegation but first I need 
to explain a bit of history about the structure of the football leagues over 
here.
Unlike, say, the NFL, we have 2 ruling bodies over here.

<p>
The Football Association (note, not the English Football Association, merely 
the Football Association, as when it was named it was the first of its kind 
- the same thing applies in golf, where the British version of the Open is 
merely called ``the Open" not ``the British Open" - well, you've got to be 
proud of your history when you can!) is responsible for football at all 
levels, which includes schools football, parks football, the amateur game, 
the national team and of course the pros.

<p>
The Football League is a slightly more recent organisation (still over 100 
years old) which, until recently, administered the top 4 divisions. 
(Divisions below these are called non-league and I presume are administered 
by organisations under the jurisdiction of the FA).

<p>
About 9 years ago, the FA decided to form the Premier League, which was 
basically what was previously known as Division One but with the number of 
teams whittled down from 22 to 20 (it was going to be 18 but the FA was 
mindful of the difficulties of getting turkeys to vote for Christmas).

<p>
The purported rationale behind this move was to reduce the number of games 
played in a season.  An English team that is successful in the numerous 
knockout tournaments during the course of a year can very easily end up 
playing over 50 games, compared with about 40 for the Continental teams, 
which tended to leave our players knackered when it came to international 
matches.

<p>
Lurking in the background as what many suspect is the real reason for the 
move was the threat of a breakaway by the big clubs.  The introduction of 
satellite TV had brought an unprecedentedly huge amount of money into the 
game and the big clubs believed that, as they have the power to attract the 
most viewers, they should get the lion's share of the money.

<p>
Previously TV money had been shared by all 92 league teams in a reasonably 
fair distribution.  Now the top clubs wanted to get their snouts in the 
trough big time and squeeze out the little guys.  This was only the 
continuation of a trend.  Back in the 70's clubs used to share gate receipts 
which meant that when a small club like Queens Park Rangers (QPR) visited a 
large club such as Manchester United, QPR would get half the gate receipts. 
The big clubs thought this was unfair and put a stop to it.  As you can 
see, the pursuit of ``parity" is not very high on the agenda of the leading 
clubs.

<p>
Anyway, the upshot was that the FA took control of the top division, renamed 
the Premiership, and negotiated a deal with Rupert Murdoch's Sky for an 
obscene amount of money, most of  which was distributed  equally among the 
Premiership teams.

<p>
Meanwhile, the Football League, left with just 3 divisions to look after, 
confusingly renamed all the divisions so Division 2 became Division 1, 
Division 3 became Division 2 and so on.  The Football League also negotiated 
a TV deal with terrestrial TV but the size of the deal was pitiful in 
comparison with the Premiership deal.

<p>
Thus we have a two-tier football society: the rich boys in the Premiership 
paying huge salaries to pampered continentals and the poor boys in the 
Football League hoping to make ends meet by selling their star players to 
the rich boys on a regular basis.

<p>
The disparity in income is so severe that there is a ``parachute" arrangement 
for teams relegated from the Premiership, so that in the season after they 
get relegated they still get a (diminished) share of the Premiership money 
to tide them over until they have got rid of all the players who were on 
Premiership salary levels.  In practice most teams use that money to finance 
their promotion efforts but it is a bit of a high risk strategy because if 
you don't secure promotion in the first season you are left with a huge wage 
bill without the revenue to support it.

<p>
So that's the main reason why relegation from the Premiership is a bad 
thing, quite apart from the fans' hurt pride.  Other factors apply, such as 
smaller crowds at lower league matches, a lower standard of football and the 
possibility of a continued slide down the leagues.  Back in the sixties a 
team rose from the 4th division to the 1st division and went back down to 
the 4th again, pretty much in successive seasons.

<p>
More recently one of the country's biggest clubs, Manchester City has just 
been relegated to Division 2 (i.e. the old ``Third Division") for the first 
time in its history.  When it slipped out of the Premiership everyone 
assumed a club with its massive fan base and highly paid players would get 
out of the division pretty quickly, which it did, only in the wrong 
direction.

<p>
The club is massively in debt, with lots of star players earning the same 
wages they were getting in the Premiership and were it not for the fact that 
some millionaire with more money than sense always turns up to bale out a 
club there would be a very real chance that the club will go belly up if it 
does not get promotion next season.

<p>
However, there are regular occasions when your analysis works out: a club 
goes down a division, regroups, regains confidence and the winning habit and 
comes back stronger.  I suspect that this scenario only really works for the 
big city based clubs. The ``cinderella clubs" who have put together a few 
good seasons to rise above their ``natural" level usually fall back to their 
natural level (or below it) if they get relegated.

<p>
This season, for instance, 2 of the 3 clubs relegated last year are coming 
straight back up and the third relegated club merely has to win a play-off 
to get promoted.  Meanwhile the 3 clubs promoted last season to the 
Premiership have all come straight back down again, suggesting there is some 
kind of limbo developing between the Premiership and Division One.

<p>
From a fan's point of view, getting relegated is a pain because it means you 
can't win the Premiership title (you can still win the FA Cup, which is a 
knockout tournament), and most of all you have to put up with constant 
jeering from your friends who support rival and, in my case, more successful 
teams.  On the plus side, clubs in the lower divisions are not compelled to 
have all-seating stadia, so you can return to the good old days of being 
able to stand and sing to support your team.

<p>
It's odd that a country the size of the USA has but 30 clubs in the NFL 
whereas a country the size of England has 92 clubs.  What this overcrowding 
in England means is that you are much more likely to come into regular 
contact with a supporter of a local rival and of course it is de rigeur to 
kick a rival fan's emotions when his team are down.

<p>
Despite all that, I would not have it any other way.  I'm not saying our 
system is inherently better than the US franchise based system, as there is 
a school of thought that says if the threat of relegation is withdrawn teams 
will play with a lot less fear, leading to a general raising of standards; I 
think this would be unlikely - it would just lead to a lot more meaningless 
games, and the British game is all about passion.  However, we have got used 
to it, the promotion/relegation format has been adopted virtually all over 
the world and one of the reasons why many of us are happy that the likes of 
Brad Martin (?) continue to reject football as a spectator sport is the fear 
that in the pursuit of the Yankee dollar (as the Skids once put it) FIFA 
might Americanise the structure of the game.  Vive la difference!

<p>
I used to think the US ``play-offs" style was an odd way of deciding 
champions.  Our system of having everyone play everyone else home and away 
seems fairer than resorting to a knockout format where an NFL team that has 
gone 16-0 regular season might go out of the play-offs to an 9-7 team 
largely because the undefeated team's quarterback and star running back got 
banged up inside for beating up their girlfriends, or whatever.

<p>
However, having watched the NFL for about 15 years and kept half an eye on 
the Pennant Race I reckon that there have been few occasions when the best 
NFL team has not won the Super Bowl (the NY Giants were maybe exceptions) 
whilst at least the baseball teams get a series of play-off games rather 
than one-off sudden death.

<p>
I've no idea how the NBA decides its champions as basketball is an instant 
turn-off for me.  I think it's the high scores that do it for me; in general 
US sports favour lots of activity (compare lots of overtaking in Indy car 
racing to minimal overtaking in Formula One) and scoring (basketball versus 
football - the concept of a thrilling 0-0 draw is probably completely alien 
to most Americans!)
<i>((You got it....))</i>
whereas European culture is more about foreplay with the 
occasional orgasm.  As such, it is a mystery why baseball has not caught on 
in a bigger way in Europe.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Not much action in this space lately, is that because I'm offering 
the wrong games?
You could ask me to run something you want to play here, you know....

<p>
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
I also would really like to open a game of Breaking Away.
Is there any interest at all??
Well, John Schultz and the game's designer John Harrington
are interested.
Others??
See the important note on this opening at the top of the szine!
You don't need to own the game to play, I'm going to use 
Keith Thomasson's house rules that include the ``how to play the game.''
I printed Keith's rules a few issues back, but some of the shaded parts
didn't reproduce properly.
I'll print the rules properly next issue. 
I thank John Harrington for encouraging me in this.
Hey, this game is free!!

<p>
Otherwise Conrad von Metzke is the editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Come and have a go if you think you're hard
enough;  Picking up a map and looking gorgeous;  There's a germ that needs
downloading;  Spread it all around.''
From the song title of the first line, off the new album <i>Me</i> by
the incomparable Mekons.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): <i>TAP</i> #203 with a deadline of May 9 arrived
on Wednesday, 20 May.
Here are my revised orders and press.
Please discard previous letters of orders and press.
Thank you.

<p>
(SPAIN to GERMANY): How are you? 
Have you been considering what Russia said 'cause so far he has been proving right in recent days.
 
(BERLIN to CREATURES OF THE EAST): Look, spare us the effluvia of your
overvivid memories of the past.  We're sick of hearing about what
happened 50 years ago, and worse, having to apologize for it.
Here we have finally reunited as a whole nation, and already you
seek to crowd us with your territorial claims and fantasies of 
``restitution".  
We will not give up an inch, and all we seek is elbow room to
allow our working with what we've got.

<p>
(SPAIN to GORGO): If Britain attacks me, can you please attack Britain for me?
For I'll stand no more from him!

<p>
(ENGLAND-SPAIN): And I thought Rich was good at getting people angry at him!

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): AND what's it to yah???

<p>
(ITA-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>TUR): Let's go check out those Great Pyramids...it will be just like
Dark Side of the Moon, man.

<p>
(SPAIN to TURKEY): Do you agree not to attack Italy or do I pass?

<p>
(ITA-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>UKR): Pope John-Paul-Ringo-George is pleased to announce the opening
of a new Hard Rock Archdiocese in Kiev.

<p>
(UKRAINE - GM): I forget your house rules.  Are all games completely
black press?  
<i>((Yes!))</i>
Not that there was any harm from it since it was a
lame attempt at impersonation, but the press labelled from Ukraine
to Poland last time was not mine.  Are there any reserved names?
<i>((Nope.))</i>

<p>
(PSEUDO-BOOB to UKRAINE): Okay you lame brain, where's all the press?
What's with this decrepit performance?  And don't give me any of that
crap about having kids, work, a life, this is a GAME here, get with
it.

<p>
(UKRAINE to PSEUDO-BOOB): But, but  I have a kid...um I mean I have a li...,
wo.., oh hell, I'm sorry, I'll try to do better, really, I will.

<p>
(ITA-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>SPA): So which one of us was going to get the Tunis ``Depot"?
	
(THE SHRINK to BOARD): The Spanish ambassador was recently diagnosed as
suffering from a rare form of megalomania.  His delusions of grandeur are
tempered only by his accusatory and suicidal tendencies.  Therefore it is
suggested that all invading armies carry a large supply of straight jackets
and happy pills in the event that this is a contagious disease. 

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): If you attack me, it will be light to pay.

<p>
(RUSSIA-ALL): And we're off!!!!! Some are just more off than others.

<p>
(SPAIN to POLAND): You have 'til Spring of 1998 to write back.
Otherwise I'll see to it that it will be your last days as the Pole.

<p>
(RUSSIA-POLAND): Ve only vant Belarus; ve vill make no further territorial
demands.
 
(SPAIN to RUSSIA): How friendly are you to Ukraine?

<p>
(RUSSIA-UKRAINE): Are we running? And where are we running to?

<p>
(SPAIN to ANOTHER MONSTER): Do be kind, attack France, especially if he
doesn't stay out of Spain.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-PLAYERS): And so it starts.
We have written each other cheesy letters, sent cheesy faxes and e-mail,
and made cheesy phone calls.
And now... ``these orders to the armies and fleets are all exposed at once.''
I've always liked the sexual overtones of that word ``exposed'' in the
rule book.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): When we are few we will have unresistible pull to a far
away land, waiting for the time of the gathering.
You never knew we were among you until now.... (there can be only one.)
It just won't be me.
Where is Conner Meclude when you really need him?

<p>
(RUSSIA-SPAIN): !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<p>
(SPAIN to G.M. AND BOARD): You all familiar with <i>Highlander</i>?

<p>
(BOOB to SPAIN): Ummm, not me...

<p>
(MADRID-PARIS): Boy, you DO have an interesting sex life.
I e-mailed your automobile repair mechanic last night, and he
informed me that you had just blown a seal.
And we all know why you Highlanders wear kilts.... because the sound
of zippers makes the sheep nervous.

<p>
(FRANCE-SPAIN): I still wish you would explain why you sent me
FOUR postcards, made THREE phonecalls, and wrote ONE rambling letter
to inform me that you intend to attack me.
I have never had the slightest intention of attacking you, but if you MUST
force me to defend myself in the south, so be it.
I still think you are making a MAJOR strategic blunder.
However, to paraphrase the philosopher Robert Ingersol, in Diplomacy
there are no rewards or punishments.... there are only consequences.
(Had to work in at least one philosopher to keep the GM happy.)

<p>
For the record, my fleet move is NOT to fight for Portugal.
Portugal is yours.
Just stay there.
The fleet in NAV is powerless to attack MAD or BAR.
It just makes sure your fleet in Portugal doesn't get
ideas about Bordeaux.
My Paris Army is moving into Marseilles next season for more defense.

<p>
(SPAIN to THE TERMINATOR): Destroy ummm, ah, just um uh, destroy, well,
ich wiess nicht.
 
(ANDRUSCHAK-MUSIC LOVERS): The <i>Doctor Demento</i> show has moved to 
11PM-1AM on Sunday evenings, far far too late for me to stay up and listen
to as I need to get up at 5:30AM every work day.

<p>
(ASIDE to GM): Yes, I have heard ``Cows With Guns'' on this show.
Also, ``I'm a Werecow''.

<p>
(SPAIN to THE GM): We will be back at the same time, same place, same 
mailbox, tschuss.

<p>
(PALACE OF VERSAILLES): Prime Minister Andruschak sat at the head of the table.
His subordinates awaited his opening statements.
``Ladies and Gentlemen, I have grave news.
Britain has informed us that a Triple Alliance of Spain, Germany, and Italy
will attack us soon, but that Britain will stay out of it if we give them
Belgium.
Germany has informed us that a Triple Alliance of Spain, Britain, and Italy
will attack us soon, but that Germany will stay out of it if we give them
Belgium.
Italy has informed us that a Triple Alliance of Spain, Germany, and Britain
will attack us soon, but that Italy will stay out of it if we give them
Switzerland.
Spain has informed us that a Triple Alliance of Britain, Germany, and Italy
will attack us soon, but that Spain will stay out of it if we give them
Monaco.''

<p>
``All our diplomatic resources have been devoted to this problem, and all have come
to the same drastic conclusion.
Like it or not, SOMEBODY is telling the truth!''
A gasp of horror filled the room.
``I will, of course, write a stiff note of protest to Jim Burgess of the International
Court about this severe breach of diplomatic protocol.
Telling the truth is unheard of in Diplomacy, so we must be prepared for the worst.
If this vile idea of telling the truth spreads, it will mean the end of international
relations as we know them.''

<p>
A voice at the bottom of the table inquired, ``But what of the eastern powers?''

<p>
``To date, we have only had minimal contact with the Five Eastern Powers.
Indeed, Russia and Egypt refuse to communicate at all.
As such, we cannot tell if this concept of telling the truth is spreading to them.''

<p>
(SPAIN to G.M.): Thanks again for the help and let's have a good game. 
Maybe my gramar will get better near the end??????

<p>
(SPAIN to BRITAIN): Remember fall is the deadline. 
Till then I'll be building in neutral.

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): Alliance??

<p>
(MADRID-ROME): ``Patre Troiae X Annos Longos Proeliato Nihil Mihi Datum
Nisi Haec Tunicula Pediculosa.''
(Translation: My Father Fought 10 Long Years at Troy and All I Got Was This
Lousy T-Shirt.)

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): Was up?

<p>
(GLORIOUS VICTORY DEPARTMENT): Wyoming's American Legion, in a unanimous
vote, demanded that the two ``Bells of Balangiga'' remain in the US.
On 28 September 1901, Philippine guerrillas used the tolling of the two
bells to launch a surprise attack on US forces, killing 45 Americans 
and wounding 22.
Then they left the town of Balangiga.

<p>
Brigidier General Jacob Smith told his troops, ``I want no prisoners.
I wish you to kill and burn, the better it will please me.''
US soldiers proceeded to kill every person over age 10 in the town,
about 5,000, and the two bells were brought back to the USA as a 
prize for this Glorious Victory.
Repeated requests by the Philippine Government for their return have
been refused.
(Source: <i>LA Times</i> newspaper for 8 May 1998.
Submitted by Harry Andruschak to explain to one of his <i>TAP</i>
correspondents why he refuses to have anything to do with the American
Legion.)

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): Remember I still want TUN for the two reasons I told you 
about and I'm not making it much of a secret I want to be there for 
probable cause to aid you and as a way to attack Britain which between 
me and him that's no big secret either. 
And when I take MOR I'll convoy an Army into WSA that way I protect my 
back and yours. 
Me and Jeff been playing tactics against each other, him as Egypt I as Spain, 
and WSA is a major key to conquering him, but we must act fast for he knows it too.
<i>((And now, if they didn't already, so does everyone else.))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY): I hope that it wasn't necessary. 

<p>
(MAP MUSINGS II): Uhhhh, haven't you ever seen Portugal in the standard variant?

<p>
(GORANSON-ANDRUSCHAK): You? A Tour II slime? Do you know how many people I'd
have to kill off to get a Tour II bid?

<p>
(GORANSON-ANDRUSCHAK II): Dr. Demento? We haven't seen him in years here in
Buffalo. Fortunately we do have ``Schickele Mix." My fav DD song was Julie
Brown's ``Everybody Run; The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun." Somehow it's just
not as funny as it used to be.

<p>
(GORANSON-ANDRUSCHAK III): Make that the 33 cent stamp. Oh, on FTF players,
doesn't Hohn Cho live in your area? I hear that chofak is pretty good. 

<p>
(GORANSON-BURGESS): He'll know what it means.

<p>
(RUSSIA-FRANCE): Are there Russian speakers in Belgium? I knew we didn't get ALL
the safe houses cleared out.

<p>
(FRANCE-POLAND): Thank you for your letter of 12 May.
We must keep an open mind about the possibility that Spain honestly thinks I
will roll over and play dead once he attacks me.

<p>
(RUSSIA-FRANCE): Horsewhip? Now you're talking my language!!! But I was saving
myself for Wendy the Wonder Sheep.

<p>
(RUSSIA-UKRAINE): The IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you've got.

<p>
(PBEM PLAYER-PBM PLAYER): ``Hello there!
I'm calling to make sure you got my voice mail message.
I left the voice mail to make sure you knew I'd sent an e-mail.
The e-mail was to make sure you had received my fax.
The fax was to make sure you had seen the letter I wrote.
You did?
Wonderful!
What did you think of my proposals?
Yes, I know the deadline is past.
Why are you laughing?''

<p>
(AMBASSADOR ATATURK POLLARD): I would rather not seek GunBoat Diplomacy,
but certain Powers have not given my nation the simple courtesy of a word,
letter, or even a sign.
The Turkish military has taken steps which is hoped will bring forth some
small measure of action....
It has begun.

<p>
(FRANCE-TURKEY): Thank you for both letters.
Alas, you can expect no help from me for a long time.
You will have to deal with Egypt all alone.
Lotsa luck.

<p>
(RUSSIA-ONLINE FOLKS): Check out the Modern Dip site at:

<p>
 http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm 
written by the creator of this
variant, Vincent Mous. This is where I get all my best strategy
from the excellent Russian articles that have been published. 

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-RICK DESPER): Thank you for your statistics about the
results of Modern Diplomacy to date.
But I think you have a vastly overrated opinion of France's position.
France does NOT have reasonable access to any set of SCs.
Monaco, yes.
But Italy and Germany will battle for Switzerland, Britain and Germany
for Belgium, and Spain and Britain for Portugal.
What else is there?

<p>
Actually France in Modern is very much like Austria in Standard.....

<p>
Standard vs. Modern: Austria = France; Turkey  = Spain; Russia = Britain;
Germany = Germany.

<p>
Furthermore, the reduced vulnerability to Britain does not make up for the
increased vulnerability to Spain and Italy.
Any multi-power attack on France should have no trouble tearing it apart
in the short run.
True, Spain will get more out of this than Britain and/or Italy, and Germany
will cop it next, but the hobby is full of players who think in terms of
short-term dot grabbing over long term balance of powers.

<p>
What surprises ME in your listing are the poor ratings for Italy and Britain.
Heck, I would have rated Italy as the strongest power in Modern, with Russia
as #2 and Britain as #3.
Yet, it is Ukraine which is #2?

<p>
And now THE questions that need to be answered by an authority.... how many SCs in this
game and how many required to win?
<i>((64 and 33....))</i>

<p>
(POLAND to NEIGHBORS): To borrow a term from the German lexicon, all I really
want is a little Lebensraum for my people.  Rest assured that all ethnic
minorities within my borders will be treated fairly thus there is no pretext
for any invasions.  International Red Cross volunteers are welcome any time to
verify Poland's open and Democratic government.

<p>
(SPAIN to UKRAINE): How friendly are you to both Poland and Russia.

<p>
(RUSSIA-BRITAIN): I didn't know what the Germans were going to do, which is why
I made the A FIN move. If I was attacking you it would have been A LAP. So
don't panic.
	
(ROME-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>WORLD): Italy is offering well wishes, as well as several neutral
centers within the Roman sphere of influence, to all its neighbors who
are friendly to the Empire.  To its enemies we offer condolences, and you
will get nothing else but a horse head in your bed.

<p>
(ITA-<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>EGY): Our purpose of moving to the Maltese Sea is to conduct military
exercizes and keep watch over any suspicious dealings of the despot
Momar.  I mean you no harm (said with a Yoda voice).

<p>
(SPAIN to UNCLE JEFFY POOH): Tell me again why Uncle Chip stopped playing
you in tactics in Diplomacy?

<p>
(EGYPT): Just to set the record straight, Sean O'Donnell is my older brother
Rick's second son.
However, the rumor that has always spread silently through the family is that
Rick was adopted! ;-)

<p>
(ENGLAND-ITALY): Good luck Eric. Being stuck between the Ohio duo cannot be
easy. Then again, maybe it will be.

<p>
(MADRID-LONDON): ``Prithee, sir, if 'tis forthright delivery of thine soul into 
the hands of Beelzebub thou seeketh, methinks thou hast divined a method of 
unfailing certainty.''

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): I hope you don't mind, but I need to build.

<p>
(MUNCHEN to DIE HINDERTUR IN SPAIN): Smile widely when you start
talking about entering the Ruhr.  We hate foreigners coming here,
stealing the jobs of good honest native Germans.  We hate foreigners
coming to steal our seats at movie theaters, or speaking loudly to
steal our thunder.

<p>
(DAVE - JIM): Well, another two szines that I subscribe to have announced
folds (<i>CCC</i> and <i>CtR</i>).  
We really are winding down at an alarming rate.
Anyone want to buy a subszine, cheap?

<p>
(JIM - DAVE): Well, you know you're always welcome here, but I hear that
you are trying to work something else out.
Good luck, I am feeling very lonely....

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Don can only build in the four centers that were among his ORIGINAL
holdings.
In particular, he can't build in Tas.
I double-checked this in the rules.
You can only build in centers that you originally held.
To make this clearer in future Supply Center Charts, I'll capitalize the
centers which are ``buildable''.

<p>
2) Since someone asked, let me remind people of the security measures I
use on orders.
For E-Mail, I always send a ``confirmation'' of orders received back by
E-Mail.
If you don't receive said confirmation, I didn't receive the orders.
Likewise, if you receive confirmation for orders you didn't send, 
you should worry.
For phone orders, I do not use ``codewords'' as some people do, but you
will find that I will do little double checks when people call me to
ensure I am speaking with the person who says they are speaking.
Lastly, for postal orders, I always look at postmarks, I always check
signatures carefully and I take careful note of the style used by
all players postally (type of typewriter/printer/handwriting, ways of
writing orders, etc.).
I also save ALL past orders to compare.
If you send me orders in an ``unusual'' style, you would do well to
make note of it.

<p>
(CHINA-RUSSIA (aka the Tim Rice Quote of the Month)): ``Well done, Judas...Good
old Judas" - ``Judas' Death" from <i>Jesus Christ, Superstar</i>.

<p>
(SCULLY to MULDER): Large numbers of UFO reports have been coming out of
Russia in the past week.  We must fly there quickly and investigate.  Is it
possible that the Russian government is under alien influence?
	
(MULDER to SCULLY): You know I do not believe in all that any more.
	
(SCULLY to MULDER): You will believe again someday.  Watch your back!

<p>
(ANONYMOUS):
``Legio Patria Nostro" These were the words heard as French Foreign Legion
troops continued the march through China.  After defeating the indomitable
General Tso and eating his chicken, the French commandeered the services of
ancient leader Sun Tsu to help them achieve victory over the Chinese dogs.

<p>
(CHINA-BRITAIN): You know all those bad things I said about you. Well I'd like
to take them back so I can use them all on Don.

<p>
(CHINA-HOLLAND): Uhhhh...you are still here, right?

<p>
(CHINA-JAPAN): I think Russia has given us a little hint. Time for us little
guys to band together. My forces (what's left of them) are at your disposal. 

<p>
(CHINA-TURKEY): You know, since Vladivostok is occcupied that means three of the
wicked witch's builds are heaaded in your direction. I think its time we
reevaluated our strategy.

<p>
(FRANCE to JAPAN): ``Luke, use the force" Congratulations on your graduation. 
As a present I solemnly swear this oath.
``I will not sally forth from my island bases
at Formosa and into Japanese waters", as long as you realize that any southern
expedition would be foolish. 

<p>
(ME to JIM): No one gave me a good enough reason to change, but I am glad to
know I can.

<i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Is the game over or is in not?  Check in next time.

<p>
2) In the meantime, a slight adjustment of Randy's address.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SHERWOOD to BARNO): Common roadkill varieties in Hermit: Sasseville,
Kinney, Emmert and Pollard.

<p>
(ELLIS to BARNO): The roadkill that Asheley seemed to prefer was dogs.
Indeed, I have a photograph of a rather grisly one still; to remember
her by.... I'll always think of her when I see a roadkill... (tiny 
violins playing in the background...)

<p>
(SD to VB): Unfortunately, you will not live to see the end of this game.  I
know our deal was for me to let you survive as long as you fed me France
and Austria's moves, but quite frankly your intelligence hasn't been
worth much of late.  Are you sure they are writing you?

<p>
(AUSTRIA to RUSSIA): I don't blame you for not writing.
Why should you?
What would you say??
It appears that no one in this game will be writing soon.
Sigh.
Gentlemen, you can blame this one on me.
I allied with him.
I got stabbed by him.
I NMRed....
Least Valuable Player....

<p>
(SD to YELLOWSTONE): Trying to get a local, in-state vacation going this
year after last year's circle trip through the Southwest.  Maybe just a
week in the mini-van in June to visit the Sierra's ignored national
parks, Sequoia and King's Canyon.  Lot of snow up there this winter,
though.  We'll make it to Yellowstone eventually.

<p>
(AUSTRIA to GM): Looks like I'd better get one last COA in before....
it would be interesting to look back on 1995IH and see how many total
COA's I had.  I bet I set some sort of record....
<i>((I think you may be right.
I'll try to remember to do that as I gather endgame stats....))</i>

<p>
(SHERWOOD to COMMUNICATIVE TRIO): I know you guys are bored with only your
own mundane scribblings to entertain you now that I have stopped
blessing you with my thoughtful, insightful missives, but you must admit
this is nothing more than a chess game for me now.  Rather than pine for
the good old days when I deigned to write you, I respectfully suggest
you write one another to avoid the rather embarrassing ``OTM" suffix the
GM keeps affixing to your futile orders.

<p>
(WESTERN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY): Amidst flaming houses, dead men and horses,
and artillery booming in the not-so-distant hills, Hungarian peasants
make their way West towards Italy.
Others, more solemn, opt to stay.
``No sense in leaving'', a white-bearded, old man mumbles, 
``The damn Russians will be in Rome too before long.''
Rumors that the famed Von Steuben would return appear to be false.
A nurse in North Africa, where he was in treatment for alcoholism,
reported that the General left the hospital suddenly, saying,
``Rehab is for quitters!''

<p>
(SHERWOOD to GM): Respectfully suggest, since there are no retreats this
summer, that should you get orders for everyone for the fall by the
deadline, you adjudicate fall as well.  Prolonging this game further
would constitute cruel and unusual punishment for my victims.

<p>
(GM to SHERWOOD): Yeah, but don't you think they need all the time they
can get to fashion a defense??
You never know, it might help.
I also don't think they're ready to give in...

<p>
(YELLOWSTONE to SAN DIEGO): Then I shall die, for concession is not an option...

<p>
(TURBOTAX): Yes, it is a shame the IRS won't go paperless yet.  And you
know they have copies of your W-2, so why must you send in copies as
well.  'nuther couple of years and the IRS will catch up.  Further in
the future is electronic clearing of W-2s, where your W-2 is sent to you
in electronic form, and you feed it to TurboTax in electronic from. 
Whole lot less...taxing.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is STILL
missing... someone find him!).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Oh, I give up, should I just drop the requirement that
anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!?
Don, of course, dodged the bullet by not moving (technically breaking
my edict) but supporting instead.... pish, posh!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
 
(LONDON to WORLD): Germany has invested his last real stab at 
unpredictability for naught.  His flimsy plans to support A Mun-Kie and
another army into Mun lend him an air of futility, rather than an outlet
jet for his pent up rage.
     
As the Hun surrenders his possessions in the East, he invites the
Sultan to further cut his forces in half while the West crunches up
what remains.  He has brought himself to a sorry end.

<p>
(PARIS to ANKARA): Doing this is not our first choice, but it runs a strong
enough second....  While things are getting too easy for you on land, we
can't simply roll over and sink in the Southern seas!

<p>
(KEITH to JIM): After all of Terry's felonious attacks on press-less Don,
I doubt your misdemeanor slap on the wrist will even register.  Duck's
hide is thick.

<p>
(BOOB to TRO): You got it..... since he sent in an order to support you,
I was thinking of voiding it, but I looked carefully at what I said.
I just said he couldn't move.
Supporting isn't moving, so you get your support!!

<p>
(ENGLAND-ALL): Just so you guys know, I'll be on vacation June 24 - July 8.

<p>
(HERMIT RUSSIA to COVINGTON CROSS FRANCE): Those of us sprinting to the
finish in '09 can only admire your stamina in the 10k.

<p>
(GERMANY - ALL): My fave disc now if <i>Go!</i> by Letters to Cleo.  
Of course they 
are not without a label, so I don't know who will release their fourth album.
<i>((Yeah, I like that record too, it's deceptively interesting!))</i>
I have a nice crush on Kay Hanley, too bad she just married Mike a few months 
ago...boo hoo.....I also love their first album, but find the second a bit 
boring.

Failure to vote vetoes both proposals as usual.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY THE turkey - GERMANY THE Germ): Your press repartee is the most
entertainment I've had in a Dip game in years.  Why would I want to stop
this game early?

<p>
(FRA-GER): I have no problem with you taking my centers.
I will withdraw my units as you take supply centers so that the 
stalemate line that I have developed remains intact until you win or we
get a three way draw.
I can safely withdraw my units in the following sequence and still keep
the stalemate line intact: 1) A Burgundy, 2) F English Channel.
If you can move your fleets around England, we can then exchange
one of yours for mine in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean, and then I
can eliminate that fleet.
That will give you three more builds.
Will that be enough to force the issue, do you think?

<p>
(TURKEY THE turkey - FRANCE THE Fannie (and that's putting it politely)):  
I am prepared to flat out lose.  I will vote yes on the 4-way one more time
and forever no on a 3-way.  If you really want the game to be over by
giving your SCs to Germany the Germ, exercise your <i>best ((sic))</i> 
judgment (Boob,
probably ``best" should be italicized with ``sic" after it, as one would if
one used ``intelligent" as an adjective around your name.  So, as you
usually edit for correct English usage anyway, feel free about the ``sic.")
and lose also.  Remember there is still a lot of fun that could be had in
this game.

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY THE turkey): How was that?
My <i>best ((sic))</i> judgment, using all my vaunted <i>intelligence ((sic))</i>
suggests that there aren't good removal choices for France which will hold
the stalemate line.
But who said I had judgment or was intelligent?

<p>
(FRA-TUR): Your press in the last issue leads me to believe that you
think I place some value on your opinion.
Let me assure you that is not the case.
I played this game poorly, and Charles was the only true ally I had.
I will support him in any moves he wishes to make to the fullest extent
possible.
I believe that my reputation in the other games that I have played in
speaks for itself.
Beyond that, I have nothing more to say to you.

<p>
(GERMANY<font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>TURKEY): I promise you will lose in your sleep.  It won't hurt.

<p>
(MIKE B to HAROLD Z.):  Would you prefer to cede your position to someone who
is interested in playing Diplomacy?

<p>
(TURKLELURKLE<font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
>BOOB): Why is Russia listed in the players' section but not
England or Italy?  Have you forgotten (again) to put the ``R's" on the map
and in the orders?  Is this a variant of your black hole, Reynolds variant
one part of the game is Fog of War?  Come on Dumbo).

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Is the game nearly over?
We could be looking at a series of wins in the szine, or perhaps not.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): In response to your comment on Karl Hoffman's change
of area code, I enclose a newspaper article on the subject of the
proliferation of area codes in southern California.
Yes, the day may come when I have a separate telephone line for my 
internet connection and it will have a different area code than my
voice phone, even though both lines enter the same room of the same
house.
<i>((See article reproduced herein, since I had an extra page
available.
Lucky for me, I already have my second phone line (the fax line 
doubles as the internet line) so they're safe in the same area code,
I hope.))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): Since this game should end in Winter 1912, (IF France
gets his act together)
<i>((Count again, dear sir, having 17?
Aye, that's likely.
The magic eighteen?
Perhaps, but not bloody likely.))</i>
I think we need to remember that I was not the original player of Turkey.
<i>((We remember.))</i>
I was just a mere standby to rescue it from CD.
I mention this in case you want to encourage the original player of Turkey
to submit an endgame statement.
Perhaps you should start listing his name and address gain, with myself 
being Turkey II.
<i>((Just who was Turkey I??))</i>
(Which brings to mind an old joke about the Hollywood craze for sequels.
A sequel too Rodgers and Hammerstein's <i>The King and I</i> is being planned
under the title of <i>The King and II</i>.)

<p>
(PIRATE CAPTAIN ANDRUSCHAK-VOCABULARY CHALLENGED HERMITS): My source for the
nautical explanation of ``the bitter end'' comes from one of the finest reference
books you can buy for your library.
This is <i>The Ashley Book of Knots</i> by Clifford W. Ashley.
Illustration #1660 comes with the following written comment...

<p>
(CLIFFORD W. ASHLEY-VOCABULARY CHALLENGED HERMITS): A cable is always ``turned''
around the bitts as pictured here, a turn in the starboard bitt being the 
reverse of a turn in the port bitt.
The end of the cable abaft the bitts is the ``bitter end''.
The common expression, ``reached the bitter end'', refers to a situation
of extremity and has nothing at all to do with lees and dregs and other 
unpalatable things.
It means literally that someone has ``got to the end of the rope''.
<i>((And how fitting for the last words I'm typing and last words physically
in the szine!))</i>
