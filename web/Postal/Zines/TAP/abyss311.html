<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, what can I say?  I was REALLY wrong about the szine being able to stay on schedule.
So we lost two months.  I think that was just "this two months", at least I am going
to try to ensure it becomes only these two months.
As a result, it sent all the subszines behind and this issue is huge in subszines, if
a bit light on me.
Still, the main point is to get the games back on track, which I think it does.
I've set what should be reasonable deadlines for the next two issues, with some adjustments
so that they aren't the usual three weekers, but focused on when I actually can 
produce it.
Enough of that. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the GOOD side, I helped Doug Kent get one issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i> out,
and we are well on the way to a dynamite second one, so I think we will reach
the century mark very shortly.
I helped do the testing so that we move to the next step so 
the new Diplomacy National World Cup is recruiting players, interested?
See below.
And, I've been having fun actually playing Dip again.
So I have been busy, just the szine hasn't gotten to the top of the list.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games.
And Andy York has been my most frequent subszine guest lately!!!
He's been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And so has Doug Kent, so we have a full stable of subszines.
And Michael Lowrey gets his in every few issues too!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As I should have known, Jeff Key knew how to find Eric Just, so
Jeff wins the fifty dollar prize.
Jeff, anything you want to do with that that I can help you with?
Or you can follow Edi's lead and donate to my travel fund, 
which NO ONE has claimed yet!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also recall that you played this version where the armies and  
fleets were numbered
and if the unit was destroyed you could not bring it back and played  
one unit short forever or
maybe it was that you had only 8 Armies and 8 fleets and regardless  
of your center count you could never get more
that those on the board...
What was the exact weirdness around that anyway?

<br /><br /><b>Jeff Key (Sun, 22 Apr 2007 11:49:33 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Edi,
You have it partially right.  My 1959 Edition of Diplomacy 
did have numbered units and legal orders could be written such as 
3A to Bulgaria and 1F (S) 3A to Bulgaria.  
That set came with 10 numbered armies (70 blocks) for each Great 
Power and either 9 or 10 numbered fleets apiece (66 blocks).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The only "odd" rule that we played was that one could win by having 
a majority of the pieces on the board.  If I remember the details correctly, 
I won my first postal game because of that rule.  
Eric Just and I had agree to a 17-17 split of the centers on the board.  
I reached my 17 first.  On a Spring turn Eric attacked Jim Bradley's 
one remaining German army in Belgium from the Ruhr and Holland.  
I moved into Picardy and Burgundy blocking Jim's retreat and 
forcing the death of his army.  As a result, I had 17 centers and 
17 units while Eric had 17 centers and only 16 units on the board.  
I could therefore declare a victory while maintaining 
the letter of my agreement with Eric.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have three regular Diplomacy sets:  that original 1959 
Allan B. Calhamer edition with a boxed set of numbered armies and fleets 
(I got my board autographed by Allan Calhamer on July 23rd, 1972), 
a 1961 Games research, Inc. edition which still came with 
wooden armies and fleets in a tray but sans the numbers, 
and a copy of the 1958 edition that Allen sent me.  
Unfortunately, those rules were thermofaxed and are almost unreadable in places.  
There were differences in the board as well.  White Russia (Ukraine); 
Transylvania; Montenegro; Pontus; Anatolia; Erzurum and Persia (Armenia); 
Mesopotamia; Calabria; The Sea of Marmora; The Bay of Tunis; Algeria and 
Morocco (North Africa), Cape Saint Vincent, Cape Finesterre, 
The Bay of Biscay and Point Saint Mathieu (the Mid-Atlantic); Lorraine; 
Flanders;  Cologne (The Ruhr); The Palatinate and Bavaria (Munich), 
The North Baltic (The Gulf of Bothnia); Wessex; Clyde; and The Kattegat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There were thirty five supply centers:
Austria had three centers (Vienna, Budapest and Trieste) plus Tyrol, Bohemia and Galicia.  
England had three centers (London, Liverpool and Edinburgh) plus Wessex, Wales, Yorkshire and Clyde.
France had three centers (Paris, Brest and Marseilles) plus Burgundy, Gascony, Flanders and Lorraine.
Germany's three centers were Berlin, Kiel and Cologne.  Its other provinces were Bavaria, Silesia and Prussia.
Italy had Rome, Naples and Venice as centers.  Other provinces were Piedmont, Tuscany, Apulia and Calabria.
Russia had four centers (Moscow, Warsaw, St Petersburg and Sevastopol 
plus Livonia, White Russia, Finland and Caucasia.
Turkey's centers are Constantinople, Ankara and Erzurum.  Other provinces were  
Smyrna, Anatolia, Pontus, Syria, Mesopotamia and Persia.
The thirteen neutral centers are Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, 
Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Serbia, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We did have numbered armies and fleets, which simplified order writing  
somewhat, but the rule about not bringing a destroyed unit back in was not our 
rule.  We did some things strangely, but not that strange.  We were the only 
game I know of to have had the gamesmaster playing in it.  That was for two 
reasons: first of all I wanted to play which was why I started the game; and 
second, because I barely knew six other players at the time, let alone seven!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cool venue AND free parking on site!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who? The Windy City Weasels is a Chicago area club dedicated to the play of 
the classic boardgame Diplomacy. We’ve been organizing games since September 2005. 
This is our club’s first annual (we hope) tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Traveling Diplomacy players Jim O’Kelley, Greg Duenow and Jeremiah Peterson, 
along with Chicago’s most honest lawyer, Thom Comstock, comprise the 
Tournament Committee. O’Kelley will serve as Tournament Director.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How Much: The preregistration fee is $35, payable by PayPal to Thom Comstock at 
Redpawn3 of yahoo.com. Just provide your name and mention Weasel Moot 
when you send the funds. We’ll charge $40 at the door.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Schedule:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Saturday, June 9;
Round 1;
Registration: 9 to 9:30 a.m.;
Round Begins: 9:45 a.m.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 2;
Registration: 5:15 to 5:45 p.m.;
Round Begins: 6 p.m.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 1 and 2 games must be completed by a time known only to the 
tournament director between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sunday, June 10;
Round 3;
Registration: 8:15 to 8:45 a.m.;
Round Begins: 9 a.m.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Round 3 will end at a time known only to the tournament director between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.
The awards ceremony will begin 15 minutes after the end of round 3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Speaking of awards, what can I win? We’ll award plaques for first through seventh 
place and some of the coolest Best Country awards you’ll ever see. 
Plus, there might be a few surprises…

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And how will said awards be determined? We’ll be using a draw-based 
scoring system with a center-count component. It will be either 
David Hood’s time-tested DixieCon scoring system or a modified version 
to give more weight to solos. Each player’s two best rounds will count 
for score. Players need only play in one round to be eligible for awards.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Housing? We have a limited supply of rooms at the Days Inn Lincoln Park North, 
which is two blocks from the tournament site, for the evenings of June 8 and 9. 
These rooms range in price from $162 per night to $180 per night 
and can hold two to four people, depending on the room. 
To make your reservation, call 1-888-LPN DAYS by May 14. 
Our rooms are being held under the name Weasel Moot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you’re looking for a cheaper housing alternative, contact 
Jim O’Kelley at jimthegrey1013 of yahoo.com. He has space available 
in two junior suites at the Best Western Hawthorne Terrace Hotel, 
which is about five blocks from the tournament site, 
for the evenings of June 8 and 9. Each suite can accommodate 
up to five people. 
Space will be available for $55 per person per night, assuming five people per suite.
And if you want something even less expensive, contact Jim. 
He’ll attempt to connect you with a local host. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anything else? Well, if there’s sufficient interest, 
we’re going to organize a White Sox outing for Friday night. 
So, let us know if you’re interested! Also, we’re probably going 
to serve Chicago-style pizza in between rounds on Saturday.

I'll only be at the game on Sunday, June 24.  You can find info about Weaselmoot, 
Boston Massacre, the upcoming World DipCon in Vancouver, and all other manner of
tournaments on the Pouch tournament web site that David Norman set up.
Visit the FTF section at http://diplom.org or E-Mail me for more info.
The Diplomacy FTF Tournament schedule, both here in North America and worldwide,
remains VERY, VERY active lately.
If I had only one slight negative thing to say about it, there is a tendency toward
inbreeding and usual suspects showing up at most of the tournaments.
That's GREAT in some ways, but I worry about attracting more FTFers in the future.
Go check out a tournament near you soon, you won't have to travel far.
Ask me if you need help (including financially).

We're running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I hope by starting this up, we'll get more to join, five songs required to enter
late.
Playing this issue (guess who is whom by number, scores are in parentheses) 
is, in alphabetical order, 
Jim-Bob Burgess, Rick Desper (1), Dick Martin, Richard Smith (3), Joakim Spangberg, and Brad Wilson (4).
The linking theme thing didn't seem to go over too well.
No one really figured out the true linking theme.  
Rick Desper was using Underground tube stops and songs with that as the title,
they were things like that.  
I'll let you guys talk a bit to each other on that with your guesses.
I have added some kind of comment on each tune.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: two more tunes (seven if you're joining up new, four if you NTRed (NO TUNES
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.

Just saw the English sci-fi film "Sunshine" a few weeks ago.  Very nice.  My review at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://chalant.blogspot.com/2007/04/sunshine-is-best-sf-film-ive-seen-in.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was interested to see Doug Kent's subzine called <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>, 
since that was recently on Channel 4.  I posted a brief response to the film 
on my blog titled "Meet me in Montauk," just a few days before reading the 'zine.  
Didn't realize that Doug's zine grabbed its title from the film, 
and that his film review bit was also titled "Meet me in Montauk".  
Part of my thinking about what I'm looking for in SF.  
(And not just Kate Winslet, who is probably the best actress of her generation, 
though I wish she would do more films like ESSM and fewer period dramas - but 
her latest film "Little Children" was also good.)
<i>((I thought in particular the child actors in "Little Children" were
excellent in doing what they needed to do and staying out of the way of the
other action.
The actress who played Kate Winslet's daughter was especially noteworthy,
I really liked when she was staring up at the lamplight.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've got "Good Will Hunting" on TV in the background.  
I want a posse with a guy like Morgan to say "my boy is wicked smaht!"  
One of my grad school colleagues, Tom Bohman, was at MIT when Affleck and 
Damon were researching this film.  
He was fairly dismissive of them, and they later included a postdoc character 
"Tom" who was a bit dweebish.  Anyway, I'm digressing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You're a Helen Mirren fan, aren't you?  I've been watching the Prime Suspect DVDs.  
If you haven't seen them, you must, esp. the first one.

<br /><br /><b>Mike Barno (Wed, 18 Apr 2007 22:07:26 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim, I've mailed you a CD copy of <i>Live from the Studio</i>, 
the second album from the Morgan String Band.  
<i>((Thanks very much, this is way cool, it's been good commuting music in my car.))</i>
This is the five-piece group that I named as 
"the best band I heard in 2005" in <i>TAP</i> issue 300.  
Flattop guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, standup bass.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was never a bluegrass fan until I got turned on to these folks.  
As a kid, I would watch entire seasons of <i>Hee Haw</i> on TV and 
only hear one or two performances that made me say "Wow"; 
the rest of the music seemed as lame and corny as the jokes.  
<i>((I like the "Car Talk" theme song too, that's really cool.))</i>
Occasionally one of the "Wow" songs was Buck Owens in the 
studio looking twenty years younger than he did in the same episode's 
"Pickin' and Grinnin'" segment, 
which is probably one of the thousand reasons I grew up so cynical.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MSB, though, really kicks it up.  The album is fine but their live 
shows are what really do it for me.  I attended seven or eight full shows last year, 
most at different locations, and caught the tail end of a couple of 
other gigs after all-day trail hikes.  
After a winter break, they've returned with several new songs 
(both originals and covers), and I've heard three more gigs.  
The worst I've heard them was maybe a seven on a ten-point scale; 
most were nines or tens.  Even if I've been hiking or snowshoeing for 
three or four hours, they get me dancing.  
The stuff rocks more than anything I hear on any genre of commercial radio.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can't tell you more about their first disc, <i>First Cut</i>, 
than you can find on their website at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.cfmsites.com/morganstring/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 the self-produced album is sold out and apparently won't be reissued.  
Nor can I tell you about their third CD since it hasn't been recorded yet.  
So I guess I have to tell you about this one.
<i>((Sounds like a plan, let's go to it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They definitely lean toward bluegrass traditions in general, 
and they went hardcore in that direction by recording all of 
<i>Live from the Studio</i> around a single microphone, 
the way it was done in the good old days before you or I were born.  
It really feels like you're sitting around a crystal radio set; 
the downside is that it's often tough to pick out the fourth 
and fifth instruments unless you turn the volume up to eleven.  
That's why I sit or stand up front at live shows, 
to hear all the richness of these well-orchestrated songs.
<i>((I've been listening to it in the car, the energy comes
through, but I'm completely losing the background.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are bluegrass classics here: Doc Watson's "Wild Bill Jones", 
Millie Clements' "Lonesome Fiddle Blues", the public-domain "Old Joe Clark", 
and so forth.  There are also some fine originals: 
mandolinist Chris Brown wrote "Stop Rocking the Boat" and 
"Guess You Should Have Known".  Both are among my favorite MSB tunes, 
even if both are among their more "accessible" 
(i.e., melodic to a mainstream lister) songs.  
The other original here is the instrumental "Jones Road", 
by guitar player Dave Carey (son of Mark the bassist).  
It's good here, but when they played it eight to ten beats-per-minute 
quicker at one early-2006 show, my fifteen-pound heavy wooden chair 
started jumping three feet side-to-side because my butt wouldn't hold still.  
(There were other fine originals on the first album such as Chris' 
"That's Right" and Mark's instrumental "Carey Breakdown".)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of my favorite song types is well-represented on this album: 
fun songs that feature a violent death.  
From "Wild Bill Jones", over a lad trying to put the moves on the 
narrator's girlfriend: "He said `My age is twenty-one, too old to be controlled.' 
/ I pulled my revolver from my side, and I destroyed that poor boy's soul."  
From the public-domain "Duncan and Brady", over a sheriff 
who tries to arrest a bar's big-shot: "White-tailed carriage 
just a-standin' around / to carry King Brady to the buryin' ground / 
Them rubber tired buggies, them rubber tired hacks / 
They took him to the graveyard, never brung him back."  
I'll bet if the Mekons played either song you'd be bouncing off the ceiling, Jim.
<i>((Indeed, they are cool songs.
I can like how these guys play too!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are a couple of modern songs here: the Bruce Hornsby/Don Henley collaboration 
"The End of the Innocence" is way too Eighties for my tastes, but they do it well.  
Don't overlook the encore that doesn't appear on the track listing.  
And at live shows, they do fine cross-genre reworkings of Rolling Stones and 
Grateful Dead tunes among others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are some AVI-format videos on the website, and they have 
something on MySpace that I haven't checked out, but most of the magic is in 
hearing them rather than watching them.  One notable exception 
(not on the first two albums) is "Nashville Cats", as they constantly circle 
around to get the right instruments highlighted as they swap focus every 
two or three seconds.  I'd better not write much about 
fiddler Carol Simek being the most fun to watch on most songs, 
as she's married.  
<i>((Why not, I suppose you might be afraid he'll google her and find this???))</i>
(Her husband's a musician in a different band.)  
Quite often she gets the most graceful dancing-in-place going, 
not for show but just for her own feeling.  
If you don't want to be a lecher, you can just watch her ankle, 
and on that alone you'll want to get out on the dance floor.  Day-yam!
<i>((I don't know about everyone else, but I think an ankle fetish
is, well, more weird.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the music.  
I've never been inspired to follow a band around this much, 
even when I lived with members of two hardcore punk bands in 1989.

Jim-Bob,
The good news is: it appears that what was on Curt Schilling's sock in 
Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS was blood.
The bad news is:  it was Jimmy Hoffa's blood.
<i>((That was Goz's reaction to the Boston brewhaha of a month
ago about whether or not the "sock blood" was real.
This was because of the incredibly stupid commentary by Gary Thorne,
the Orioles broadcaster about this on a telecast.....
for those of you who never saw the story, you didn't miss anything.
Anyway, in Goz's letter I'm missing he commented on how much he
is getting "into" Thomas the Tank Engine, to which I replied: 
"Cool, my granddaughter (now 2.5 years old) also loves Thomas the Tank
Engine, do you also have all the "kid Lego" track for him?  We've given
Emily three sets so she has lots of track and trains."))</i>
Nathan has a mile of track, but not Thomas scale.  He's got some 
Fisher-Price set, with something like 10 remote-controlled engines and 
enough cars, scenery, etc. to cover maybe half a state's worth.  We can't 
set the whole thing up in any one room.  We've been able to connect the 
entire upstairs with it before Carol caught us once.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) As someone asked, in this particular game EVERYONE now has E-Mail access, see the 
addresses above.
I think they are all up to date, aren't they??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND): Gee, guy!  Did you think I would make you go down in 
flames so soon?  Sweat it out.  I have bigger fish to fry such as the Turk.  
Frankly, I hate the smoke from all of those burning bridges lit by Austria.  Be 
realistic!  Ally with Germany, Russia, and France while you are somewhat of a 
force.  You might be allowed to survive the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GAME): The above press was sent first.... and then....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND): I wonder what squashed Englishmen look like in the 
Portuguese surf?    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GAME): Hmmmm.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS - 7 OF 9'S LOG): Having sent a tactical
plan to the Andorians and the Ferengi for our joint
effort against the now crumbling Cardassians, the plan
was analyzed by the Ferengi ally, the Packletts, an
annoying race who are much smarter then they led
everyone to believe. They noticed a flaw in my plan
suggesting that it would put the Enterprise at risk
and that could be long term critical as we are the
only allied starship this deep into Cardassian space
other the Cardassian's Dominion allies. 
It's possible we may have turned a corner here. 
Too bad we don't possess a cloak.
We have adjusted our stratagy thanks to the Packletts.
7 out...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): My idiot Indians were in New York against
the Evil Empire this week.   The winning run is on 2nd
base with first base open in the bottom of the 9th
with A-Rod up. 
Our genius manager Eric Wedge 
<i>((Actually, I think Eric Wedge IS a genius manager, the
best of the current young managers.
The Red Sox just beat up on the Indians this week though,
sorry about that.))</i>
decides to let our journeyman closer Scott Borowski pitch to
A-Rod rather then walking him and he hits a walk off
home run. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I mean what in the
name of Mike Hargrove iz goin' on here?! 
Have I ever mentioned that I hate the Yankees...
<i>((Uh, yeah...
we're all vicariously enjoying the Yankees failure.
As I've been saying for years now, this is just the 
continuation of losing the character guys like Paul O'Neill
who really were responsible for the Yankees' success a decade
ago.
Jeter is presently the only one left, after Bernie Williams
was forced out.
I still think that you can't make snap judgments about
managers, hey criticize each decision all you want, but
Eric is still a great manager.
You do well to get more than half of them right.))</i>
Hey Jim, I have an idea for the name of the new Modern
game: "Fear and Sleep Deprivation".
<i>((I'll take it under advisement.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Wow, as many of you predicted, EVERYONE replenished with a three.
So one thing that everyone has is threes..... we'll see how many people
play a three next turn.
