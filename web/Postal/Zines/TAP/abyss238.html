<p><br><p><br>John Caruso is looking for people RIGHT NOW who might want to take some
spots in our Postal/E-Mail Baseball League.
It is a great system for people who don't like Rotisserie Baseball,
but really want to MANAGE their own teams, right down to styles of
play, setting balanced lineups, making pitching rotations, and 
trading with some wonderful GMs!
You can check out the structure of the league at http://www.szine.com,
though David Wang has not kept the Web Page totally up-to-date.  He has been
too busy battling Kathy Byrne Caruso's Mets team for the National League
spot in OUR World Series.  My team collapsed this year, but as always
there are hopes for next year.
I think there are three team slots open to be taken: Seattle, the Cubs,
and Arizona (you can look at lineups, etc. on the web page).
There are lots of Caruso family members in the league, plus people
like Woody Arnawoodian, Don Ditter, Dick Martin, Gary Behnen, etc..... yes, where
those old warhorse Dippers go away to die.
But seriously, we have a great deal of fun.
E-Mail John at: poppopjohnc of juno.com if you're interested.

<p>
Yes, we're late again.  This all has been work related as the pace of work
this fall for me has been horrendous.
<i>Diplomacy World</i> also likely will be a little bit late being released.
Luckily for me, today things seem to be lightening up.  I had four 
presentations to make in three different cities this week, plus I had to
finish rewriting a paper.
But that is now the worst of it.... I hope.
As usual when late, I am holding a few things for next issue that I have in hand
already.

<p>
We have a <i>Tinamou</i> and an <i>Octopus' Garden</i> in here, but no
final <i>Dead Poets Society</i>.  
DO I HAVE to go to California personally and sit on Don Williams until
he finishes his endgame statement and then carry it personally to
Pete Gaughan to get this done???
If I have to, I will, but....
Don should look at the descriptions of the first Diplomatic Incident game
below....

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
This will finally be going up soon as the amount 
I lose on every paid subscription rises.
Get your resubs in now and then I'll go up by 50% starting with issue #240.
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the new game start announcements below!
BUT, I really won't
start any more until the Modern game ends (then I will start 
another Modern with the Wing rule).
Some other options are out there.
Mark Kinney is trying to get his dipszine going again (one game is
already filled), but he may have other openings.
Mark is looking for standbys too.
Contact Mark NOW at 4820 Westmar Terrace #6, Louisville, KY  40222, (502) 412-3079; 
alberich of iglou.com and get on his subscription list.
I'm in the game and you CAN'T miss watching ME play....
there or somewhere else.

<p>
Tim Haffey's ``Who Do You Trust?'' has already folded!  My personal opinion
is that Tim didn't know enough people to get started and should have hooked
up as a subszine with someone perhaps.
He is DEAD wrong that there are no people out there looking to find
slower Diplomacy games than the E-Mail turbophreaks.
But it has NEVER been true that blind mailouts of samples brought back
a great return.
Please, Please, Tim, reconsider!!  
I've got lots of pent up game demand in my szine and perhaps I could 
help you get started.

<p>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
 
<p>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/

<p>
Through Stephen Agar's (who is still
in charge here) Postal portion of the Pouch:

<p>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen's more extensive efforts at (note the new address):
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com

<p>
The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (VERY, VERY badly) John Caruso's postal
baseball league that I am in.
John and Kathy Caruso are now up on E-Mail and if David doesn't
get off his butt soon and start updating the page more frequently, 
John probably will go invent his own web page.
This is a problem at the present time....

<p>
2) For the most recent issue of Pete Sullivan's subszine 
check out (this address will be changing shortly):

<p>
 http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR GREGORY STEWART</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Come on, I know we have some BIG Gregory Stewart fans around here.
Even some reminiscences about Mr. Stewart's infamous press style
would be nice.
Fifty bucks for finding him before the deadline for issue 240.
A rumor exists that someone DOES know where he is, but nothing from Gregory yet....
check in next issue for a further update.
Get crackin' on this one!!!

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com or johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

We are still trying to sort out the old subscription information and so I will
tell everyone more about that yet one more issue after next.....
But go look at the new issue there now.
It WAS released in July.
Why haven't YOU seen it??

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Dave Partridge has a good description of the latest Diplomatic Incident
in <i>Tinamou</i> elsewhere in this issue.
I just want to add one thing to that.
David Wang (as Italy) and I (as Germany) pulled off the "Don Williams"
attack on France, by having an Italian army end up in Munich in Fall 1901.
This was totally planned by David and me from the beginning and the two
of us working together were the right mix of personalities to pull it off.
Unfortuately, Nick Parish (in England) didn't quite believe what was happening
OR preferred to stick with John Power (France) as an ally, so we didn't
sweep the board, but here's some of my exchange with John about the weekend:

<p>
<p><b>John Power (Wed, 4 Oct 2000 12:28:53)</b>

<p>
Hi Jim,
Glad we got to meet last weekend.  It was good to finally put faces to
some of the people I've been writing to for several years.  Also congrats on a
piece of the draw in the first game.  That would have been an interesting
one to play out, but definitely was going to take more time than anyone
seemed interested in investing.
 
<p>
<i>((It was great to meet you too, even if we did a lot of butting heads
in the game.  You played Nick VERY well in getting him to support
YOUR move to Burgundy and NOT Italy's in Spring 1902..... David Wang
and I had that plan in place from the very beginning of Spring 1901
negotiations and you messed it up ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
I wondered about that when you weren't all that interested in retaking Mun,
but after you voluntarily left Bur I wasn't sure.  That's a great
anti-French strategy as David's 2 new fleets really bottled me up.  Lucky
for me Austria stabbed before you guys could break through.  As for playing
Nick, I'd say he played the three of us quite nicely.  Kept us banging heads
while he marched around and gobbled up centers.  I was worried when he built
nothing but fleets, but what are you going to do?

Hi Jim-Bob,

<p>
Far be it for me to criticize your excellent (*cough cough*)
photocopies of my digi-pictures, but your readers, if they want to
see the originals in shiny color, can view everything in the

<p>
http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/tbi/people/desper/images/WDCX

And, if they are bored, they can pop up to the images directory
and look at the other 500+ photos from my summer travels.  I suggest
checking out the Holstis in the Schleswig-Holstein directory.  Or the
Jungfrau in the Interlaken directory.  

<p>
If this draw doesn't pass soon, I'll have to start clipping photos to
my press releases for SMTM!  I'll make the game into a slide show!

find gamers whose tastes in games are similar to your own.

<p>
This service is ABSOLUTELY FREE to ALL gamers.  PLEASE stop by and input
your data:

The hobby has long been in need of such a database, and now it is
available.  However, the database will only be useful if the number of
people listed is large, so please input your data NOW!

The tape thing has become a CD thing and still going very slowly. 
I need some uninterrupted time to do it....
I think I'll end up doing this over the Christmas vacation this year.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.
For now, I'm going to stop reprinting all the rest of the header stuff
each issue.
The way I do things, I was sticking it in my face so I noticed it
and kept it on my to-do list, but obviously it was way too repetitive.
Thanks VERY much to Paul Rauterberg who has given me a whole bunch of info
that will be invaluable in converting songs from vinyl records to CD.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Sun, 1 Oct 2000 19:18:45 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<p>
PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS:

<p>
A's vs. Yankees - Considering the Yankees couldn't win even one game
in the last week, against the lowly Devil Rays and Orioles, it's hard
to imagine them winning three of five from the red-hot A's.  Are they
supposed to take comfort in Roger Clemens starting game 1?  Against
the A's?  Well, at least he doesn't have to face Dave Stewart again.
Clemens has never been a great postseason pitcher, and the A's
have great hitters.  Meanwhile, the Yankees are playing the worst
baseball in the majors.  A's in, hmm, 4.  (But a sweep would not
be surprising).

<p>
White Sox vs. Mariners - an intriguing matchup.  Mariners trade away
the best player in the AL, and suddenly they are a playoff team?
Just goes to show that the few players who are making the really big
bucks are almost certainly overpaid.  Mariners have been hot lately,
not as much as the A's, but almost.  White Sox were the best team in
the majors in the first half of the season, but have looked quite
beatable lately.  (They were just swept by the Red Sox!)  Problem for
the ChiSox is that their best pitchers are hurt.  And they don't play
great defense.  I figure ARod, Edgar, and Olerud will be enough
offense to get the M's to the ALCS. M's in 5.

<p>
NL:
Mets vs. Giants - Mets have no hitting and great pitching.  Giants
have decent pitching and decent hitting, including the top two MVP
candidates in Jeff Kent and Barry Bonds. (Piazza would not be
considered a candidate if he didn't play in NY.)  Plus, the Giants
are great at home.  At least one Met starter will make noise.  Giants
in 4.

<p>
Braves vs. Cardinals - very interesting, we've got always-revered
Tony La Russa vs. the always under-appreciated Bobby Cox.  The two
best centerfielders in the NL in Jim Edmonds and Andruw Jones.  Cards
have home field advantage - a big plus since St. Louis is possibly
the best baseball town in the country.  Big Mac will certainly make
some noise.  This is a tough one to call - the Braves have the
experience, while the Cardinal pitchers are relatively young.  I'll
take the Cardinals in 5, but with little confidence.

<p>
ALCS:  Going to keep riding the hot team.  A's in 6.  
NLCS:  General Dusty makes his mark.  Giants in 7.  

<p>
Which brings us to a second Bay Series, a rematch of the famous
'89 series which featured the earthquake during the pregame show.
In my extra-special prediction, I say that The Big One hits during
the
9th inning of game 7, when the Giants are down by 2, they have the
bases loaded, and Jeff Kent is batting.  California falls into the
sea, and it is revealed that a billionaire named Lex Luthor now owns
beachfront property.  

<p>
After Superman turns back time, the Giants win in 7.  
<i>((This is what ***I*** wanted to happen....
the Giants are my team even more than the Red Sox, but
at least Dusty was re-signed, so they'll be back.))</i>

<p>
Overall odds:  (assuming I guess wrong at least once)
Giants 2:1;
A's    5:2;
Cardinals 3:1;
Braves    3:1;
Yankees   6:1;
Mariners  8:1;
Mets      8:1;
White Sox 10:1.

<p>
Yes, I'm a bit negative about the ChiSox.  The Yankees have lower
odds, since I figure if they play like they did in August, they can
beat anybody.  But they probably won't.  

<p>
For the teams who didn't make it - the Indians are probably kicking
themselves for trading away David Justice.  I just didn't understand
that move at all.  How could they, of all teams, give up so early?
I predict they will resign Manny Ramirez, no matter what it takes.
They cannot let all of their outfielders go to the Yankees (I know,
the Bombers aren't interested in Lofton.)  The Jays?  Well, they
have hitting, but need more pitching than just David Wells.  Pat
Hentgen?  Well, he's starting for the Cardinals (who, not
coincidentally, are in the playoffs.)

<p>
The beloved Red Sox?  Well, looking at the paper today, I saw the
list of all the AL hitters who had enough plate appearances to
qualify for the batting title.  While it was nice to see Nomar's name
at the top for the second straight year, four of the bottom fifteen
were Red Sox.
Varitek, Offerman, O'Leary, and Daubach.  There is your problem. 
There are too many outs in the lineup.  Offerman and Daubach can
blame injuries, and Varitek is only a catcher, but O'Leary has little
excuse.  You've got to get a lot more hitting from left field. (And
don't get me started about third base.)  After watching Carl Everett
act like a 2-year old in the final weeks of the season, Sox fans are
pining for Mo Vaughn more than ever.  Mo would never have
disrespected his manager.  About all you need to know about Dan
Duquette is that he stands behind Everett and runs Mo out of town as
fast as possible.  
<i>((I agree with this entirely!))</i>

<p>
I've heard the Sox are interested in Mike Mussina.  Of course, who
wouldn't be.  But the Sox had the best pitching in the AL this year,
in spite of a host of things going wrong (Gordon, Saberhagen, and
Juan Pena all gone before the season started, for example).  Pedro
will anchor the staff again next year, with Okha (3.16 ERA with no
run support this year) looking like another good starter.  After that
your guess is as good as mine, though there are a lot of pitchers
drifting around.  You've got to figure Joe Kerrigan will keep the
staff in order.  Won't matter if they can't hit the ball.   Who would
have ever thought this would happen to the Sox, who got 100 RBI from
Butch Hobson in the #9 position in 1978.  Where are Rice, Lynn,
Evans, Fisk, 
Yaz, and their like?  Why doesn't their farm system produce hitters
anymore?  To really fix the problem, the Sox need a new owner,
somebody with more money who will fire Dan Duquette just because
Duquette is a weenie.  He'll then hire a big-time GM (Pat Gillick
type), who will retain Jimy Williams, Nomar, Pedro, and half the
team, 
get Everett into anger management or on the bus out of town, and
restart the farm system so they start getting decent position players
again.  The Sox had a great farm system as recently as the 80s (even
if sometimes they were bad judges of their own talent [Jeff
Bagwell]).

<p>
Well enough about the Sox.  I see that the US men's 4x100 team
made total asses of themselves yesterday.  I think they were a bit
misled by the whistling.  In the US, whistling is normally positive.
Many other places (including Australia, apparently), whistling is
derisive.  They mis-interpreted the whistling and hammed it up,
embarrassing the country in the process.  Oh well.  My TV was fried
by lightning last week so I basically missed the whole Olympics.  

<p>
Hope you had fun at the Incident.  I ended up having a cold this
weekend, so it was a good thing I didn't try to come.  Besides, I've
been suffering a bit from disorientation (too much travelling) so I
wanted to just stay in DC and relax.  

<p>
Did you ever get a team together for the WM00 tournament?  I ended up
joining Team Canada at the last minute and was assigned A-H.  Yippee.

<p>
I know, I owe you stuff about Ruffians, and I'm trying to organize
a demo game.  I see you grabbed some candidates for the Boasters

I must say I'm really fascinated by Toby Harris' playing style.  He
has to be considered the favorite for the Finals of 99.  Oh - and our
li'l Dave P. is having a great tournament too.  Just think - we knew

Sorry I didn't make DonCon to be see WDC, however that weekend the contract
ran out here at work and all non-union employees like me were REQUIRED to be
here till about noon on Saturday of the last weekend of DonCon. I probably
could have gotten there by midafternoon (as the plant I work at is just off
95 in northern Delaware) but I didn't know who all would be there so I just
blew it off. Had I been able to come down on Friday night I might have come.

<p>
I will definitely be out at some cons next year as I will have three weeks
of vacation (two for next year and one carried over from this year.)
Unfortunately this year I didn't get any vacation time till May 1st.

<p>
Anyway, I was very sorry to hear about Robert Sacks, we had our
disagreements but I will miss him. I'm not sure I think he was the impish
elf that some of your readers think he was but he was a loyal friend. I
hadn't seen much of Robert the last few years as when it AtlanticCon went
under he switched to the supercilious BDA thing of Greenwood's. I didn't
then, and don't know, have much use for anything run by Greenwood. Having
said that I will come to DonCon next year simply because I trust most of the
GMs and I enjoy the open gaming immensely. I did send his parents a sympathy
card.

By the way, thanks for sending me a copy of <i>DW</i>. Very slick. I have to say
you're much more impressed with Edi Birsan than I am. I wish Edi would
spend more time on actual playing or GMing than all this ``hobby empire
building".  Even from your article, other than help with the website, the
guy doesn't seem to have done much since the early 70's. 
<i>((The ghodstoo game, which is preserved for posterity at the

<p>
I watched the first episode of ``Survivor" because the girlfriend wanted to
but I never watched it much after that. I wasn't that enthralled with it
myself. While there was the ability to do some ``Diplomacy" type stuff, from
my limited exposure to the show, it looked to me like standard novice
stuff-everyone allied with the person they ``liked" the best.  Real
Diplomacy is allying with people you don't like but need.
<i>((See below, and the next game will see MUCH more of that.))</i>

<p>
By the way, Tom Swider and I  have been trying to get Diplomacy going at
EPGS (Eastern Pennsylvania Gaming Society, if you're really interested you
can go the website at www.epgs.org.) We managed to have one game where I
managed to get eliminated TWICE! You can stop laughing now, ya Boob! I was
France and then some people had to leave early so I took over a rather
pathetic Austrian position. There was only one other person besides myself
in the game who had played, but we did get Tom Mainardi involved by the end
of the game as well as our GM Tom Swider. 

<p>
I got crushed as the two Toms kept saying ``you stab your ally first and
then I'll make my move...." to each other over and over. Basically I grew
France too big, too soon (+3 in '01)  and the board panicked and attacked
me.  I knew it was a bad move but the novices were boring my standing around
and doing nothing....I should have given my dots away and forced them to get
bigger, but being a good Dip player I'm a greedy bastard and I was stupid
enough to show it in this game.

<p>
I was glad to see Mark Lew check in, besides Brad Wilson holding court in
<i>Vertigo</i>, he's my favorite American zine writer. I agree with him about Michael
Moore except he forgot to mention that Moore likes to ask ``Tell me, do you
still beat your wife and molest your children?" type questions of the
``villain" and then acts like the villain is a fascist for telling him to
take his camera and ram it.

<p>
I do disagree with Mark on why people don't vote. I think people don't vote
because our winner take all system discourages people from voting. Why vote
if neither party speaks to your needs? Countries that have some sort of a
percentage based legislator, like Germany or Israel, generally have a better
turnout then we do. Having said that I think turn out tends to go down in
times of peace and prosperity.

<p>
Personally I'm going  with Libertarian Party from now on. The only thing I
really don't agree with the LP is gun control. I'm completely for gun
control. My attitude is if I trusted other people with weapons we wouldn't
need a government. We do need a government so I don't trust my neighbors to
carry guns. 

<p>
I also see our medical system becoming increasing socialized. Unlike most
Libertarians I don't have a problem with that because I don't see medicine
as being a normal economic good like housing or computers. No one skimps on
health care if they have a choice because the risk at the individual is so
drastic-death. It makes little sense to maximize your economic wealth when
you might die since you can't use any of the wealth if you're dead. I find
it bitterly ironic that the party that screamed at seniors about ``having the
government in your medicine cabinet" five years ago when Clinton was trying
to put together National Health Care now can't wait to give away
prescription drugs to seniors. Guess it's okay if to have SOME government in
your medicine cabinet. Of course, those of us not part of the targeted
interest group, won't get squat and our prescriptions will likely cost more.

<p>
It's not hard to see why people don't want to have children anymore. They are
a luxury that those of us working age can increasing NOT afford.  The
supposed ``surplus" is thanks to our 33% social security tax....when the hell
is someone besides the Libertarian Party going to talk about giving that
back? And then the elderly moan that they are stuck paying the social
security tax if they work? Well boohoo...they already get much more than
they ever put. We need to get real and raise the age of retirement to 75
already and stop this shame that people can afford to retire at 65. They
can't, unless they have their OWN savings. Even with all of our increasing
productivity our economy simply cannot afford this large class of retired
workers. It is breaking the backs of those of left working.

Dear Jim,
I note that some of your readers are interested in Survivor as a possible derivative
or parallel to Diplomacy.
I didn't watch much of it but read something about it in the papers.
The proprietors are undoubtedly delighted beyond their wildest dreams by the
viewership it got.
I suspect, based on the rules, that the proprietors actually expected much more
alliance activity, and probably more romantic activity, 
<i>((They were especially hoping for the latter....))</i>
than actually took place.

<p>
Here's a hypothetical question that might be interesting: if you had been in the
Survivor cast of sixteen, and the other fifteen had all had significant Diplomacy
experience, what strategems would you have attempted, and what situations would
you have expected to arise?

<i>((I've expressed some of my thoughts on this already.
I would be making ``cross-team'' efforts from the very beginning, where I could
in order to set up for the second half of the game.
Early on, the goal would be to avoid a ``tit-for-tat'' situation and try to be
the go-between within the groups.
In other words, don't start off from the beginning as the ``escalator of the level
of the game''.
BUT, I would want to be anticipating and watching as this was occuring (when the
levels of deceit start to rise) in order to stay on top of it.
I don't have Richard's personality, but I think Greg did a good job for awhile
of playing somewhat how I would have played it.
Greg of course, also is a Brown Univ. graduate....
but above all, I would want to be leading STOP THE LEADER alliances.
That was really frustrating to watch in the first edition that will not happen
again.
You don't want to be part of the initial strongest alliance, because that one
can be beaten back.
I also thought that Richard was cagey in losing challenges on purpose.
This is not usually part of Diplomacy (though Jack McHugh mentions that
tactic precisely just above), but it is essential here.
You need to lay low at times to keep sailing toward the final two.
Other thoughts would be welcome!))</i>

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>ONE OTHER GAME OPENING:

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The other Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings''
rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
I have one person signed up, but I've still forgotten who it is.

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

He does report that he is out of the hospital, back home, but in quite a
drug induced haze.
As a result, I have chosen to delay the game.
Pete Gaughan should be pleased that he did not have to assume the role
of ``designated ToadFather standby" by this decision.
A contributing factor to this was the vacation that Buddy was on right
through the deadline.
If I already had orders from you, they are still on file, but they may
be changed if you wish.

1) I wanted to go to 11x17 paper for the maps, but the place where I
do my copying doesn't support that paper size and I have to stay
with what is cheap.
Comments are still welcome, but I'm not sure what else I can do.

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Everyone except Heath is still more or less in the game, should be
an exciting last year!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(WEISS to BOOB): Seems like there are two nominations for the Father of the Atom Bomb for
the next Yuppie game.  How about the press/survivor voting option being
included?
<i>((Ummm, yeah, how does that work now???
I know, I know, I'm dense.))</i>

<p>
(BLACK PRESS PRODIGY - REST OF YOU SUCKERS):  Hit me if you can.  Nah-nah-nah
yah-nah.  Bet you can't find me!  Come on, make my day and hit me.

<p>
(RUSSIA): Build 4 upgraded nukes with 10 MIRVs each.

<p>
(WEISS - ALL):  I do like bad attention better than no attention, but
whomsoever is deluded enough to believe that I write black press qualifies
as 295.3 (acute psychotic break in a chronic schizophrenic according to the
International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition).  With a name like
mine, come on, ``Weiss" = White in german.  White press.  White press.  Weiss
is nice press.

<p>
(MIKE to ALL):  You really don't want to nuke me.  Everybody who nukes
me gets their name smeared across the Internet through the Diplomatic
Corps site.  Everybody who instead nukes the GM gets promoted worldwide
as swell people worthy of awards and praise.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): I will be on vacation 22 October to 13 November. Three 
nights in Vienna, 14 nights on a deluxe river boat cruising from Vienna to 
Amsterdam, and three nights in Brussels.  My plans for Spring 1907 are to 
once again nuke Heath Gardner.  However, I am hoping that Richard Weiss is 
reading this press and understands that I need a commitment from him not to 
nuke me in Spring 1907.  Otherwise I shall send the nukes towards Richard Weiss.  
But I'd rather not.  Richard, are you reading this?  Do you understand?  

<p>
(AUSTRIA-ENGLAND):  I was watching your strategy this time. I'd adapt it, but
it stinks, like the rest of your strategy!

<p>
(HEATHBAR-WEISS):  We know you are about to get it, now that I clued the
clueless Jody Mac into your true identity.  Why do you do this shit anyway?

<p>
(BARNOVIAN STRATEGIC PLANNING HQ):  ``Guile and deception were all very
well, but a good, heavy bombardment beat hell out of either of them." 
- <i>Crusade</i>, David Weber &amp; Steve White.

<p>
(PREMIER OF FRANCE AND KING OF THE BOBBY KNIGHT SCHOOL OF BASKETBALL COACHING
FOR PRISON YWCA PROGRAMS - EASTERN CAC WIMPS): Why do you guys still think
UMASS and Rhodey Islands are something on the round court?  Did you see my
man Knight, oops, Mr, Knight to you, teach manners and moves to Indy
Freshmen!  I dig that dude.

<p>
(SARA/HARRY):  Bush has hired a personal trainer.  Did you read that?  Bobby
Knight!  He can handle anyone now.  I only worry why Gore installed a mole
on his wife's face and in the Bush camp?  Does he think he's looking for
Marilyn?

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Some adjustments and some press.... and life goes on.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MIKE B to JIM S):  I don't blame you for bailing out of Sydney and
avoiding the Olympic crowds and hype.  The Barrier Reef sounds like a
far better surrounding.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE WORLD):
I shall send invitations to all who vill come aboard our new Battlefleet once 
it is fully fitted.
The launching ceremony vill be on Jan.7th,1906.....
Vee have named za new Dreadnought battleship za ``Von Steuben" after a famous 
military hero from our past...Zis new flagship vill indeed host a dinner 
party in za near future...

<p>
(PALACE OF LIGHT AND GLORY):  `` `Condition Omega!' he snapped.  `Abandon
ship!  All hands, abandon ship!' "  - <i>Crusade</i>, David Weber &amp; Steve
White.

<p>
(MINISTRY OF FOREIGN PROPAGANDA RELATIONS):
...as Pope Jizmo is very busy.
Invitations to the new fleet launchings, a 
blessing of the Battlefield in Bulgaria, and the great ball festival in Moscow 
will certainly keep His Holiness out of mischief while strengthening 
relations between out two countries.......

<p>
(PALACE OF ``GEET" AND ``ALLDAWAY"): All the civil servants in the Office of 
Public Information that volunteered for Militia units are now scrubbing down 
the decks of Italian warships. They aren't doing a very good job of it, but 
they're pretty adaptable folks. They'll learn.

<p>
(IN BULGARIA):
DEAD!!!! DEAD!!!! DEAD!!! (the sounds of the wailing Turkish women.....)

<p>
(SPEEDICUT, TO HIMSELF ON HIS WAY TO THE BULGARIAN KILLING FIELDS): ``That 
Bastard Flashy better show up to this damn thing... I don't think I have 
enough piss in me to cover ANOTHER Turkish battalion. Christ! You'd think 
they'd learn sooner or later!"

<p>
(REPORTING FROM MOSCOW):
It is a Miracle!!! I have found Harry Flashman alive! I had almost given up.
The battlefield was a mess.
Broken wagons,dead horses,the smell of burnt 
powder...it was a grisly site, even though this particular field was nothing 
compared to what has occurred in Bulgaria...as I was saying, I had just about 
given up when towards the end of the day I noticed a handful of ravens 
circling above a mass wreckage of material.
I decided to investigate(the corpsman had cleared out this area days ago)
I began to rummage through some of the debris when I discovered a hollowed 
out area beneath! a sort of depression...I began to push and shove away with 
earnest...
Lo and behold, I uncovered an area perhaps 9' by 9'.
To my utter amazement a man was near death lying in a heap on the floor...
Even more remarkable,he was wrapped up in a bloodied,
bullet torn Austrian flag! I immediately found a few men to help me and we 
were able to move him to a field hospital.
By his rank and those whiskers on his face,I knew that this had to be General
Flashman....at present he is recuperating well.
It would seem that this Hero shall live to lead another day...

<p>
(POPE SPEEDICUT to WORLD): ``As it turns out, the Mighty Sultan DID contact my 
emissaries, albeit late, in an attempt to sway me in my angered moments. But 
Alas! The word reached me too late! Orders were already issued to the 
Italian fleets and time ran out. And as is apt to happen, another page of 
history went down in the books."

<p>
(HUEY ARMSTRONG, AMERICAN AT LARGE [reporting from Rome, Dec. 8th 1906]): ``An 
amazing statue has appeared out of nowhere, taking up almost all of the 
street in front of the residence of Chief of Foreign Relations, the 
Honourable Mr. Scott Munson. No one knows when it arrived or how it got 
there. It seems to be made out of dung, and standing at 25 feet tall, must 
weigh in the neighborhood of 2 to 3 tons. At first glance, it looks like a 
large fertility doll. Naked, the grotesque statue is covered in horse hair 
and has large, sagging breasts, multiple body rolls of fat and no genitalia. 
But upon closer inspection there appears to be a `nipple' of sorts between 
its legs. The purpose of the nipple can only be guessed. The face of the 
monstrosity, though affable looking, appears to be of an imbecile wearing 
spectacles. The head of the statue is mis-shaped, rather bulbous, and quite 
frankly, resembles a penis. A plaque at the foot of the statue read as 
follows:

<p>
`you are SUCH a fuck.' 

<p>
 The less educated people of Rome appear to be leaving `offerings' to the 
statue, and sometimes can be seen kneeling in front of it, as if in prayer. 
The mystery is still unsolved."

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL JON RHODEHAMEL to THE RUSSIAN SUPREME FIELD COMMANDER):
Perhaps we could turn this over to Ambassador Pollard.
Negotiations are possible...
I do-not necessarily wish to take Saint Petersburg...
It is an option...
Do you wish to make some sort of agreement???

<p>
(OTTOMAN ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF HEYMAN WATTATURK):  ``Whatever his decision,
the politicos had managed in time-honored fashion to clear their own
skirts with a pious appeal to `expert military opinion.'  What a shame
they so seldom bothered to seek it <i>before</i> they created such a
bitched-up shitball!"  - <i>Crusade</i>, David Weber &amp; Steve White.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Lots of moving around, only a few bounces.... 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ENGLAND): As much as I would like to, I just
cannot allow Italy a new lease on life only to have my
throat cut once again. 

<p>
(BRITAIN to WORLD): It can't really be that there are still 7 countries 
alive, can it?

<p>
(AUSTRIA - ITALY): Sorry bud. 
But I just figured it would be best to finish what I started. 

<p>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY): I trust you are enjoying the English weather.  
Spend lots of money with the locals and enjoy the London sights.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA/AUSTRIA): Maybe someone is lying to me.  Maybe a couple of
someones.  Maybe I owe someone an apology.  Let's see.

<p>
(GERMANY to TURKEY): What's your hockey take this year?  Will my Blackhawks
make the playoffs for the first time in recent memory?

<p>
(DATELINE BOSTON): The year's first Presidential Debate was nearly delayed
when the Gore camp made a new condition for the debate that the Bush camp
balked at.  But eventually Governor Bush allowed Vice President Gore to kiss
him, but the Vice President had to take the Governor out to dinner and
dancing first.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Well, it's October, let's  &lt; Puff &gt;  blow the dust off of last
May's issue and see what I said, shall we?  Hmmm, Yankees, Indians, Rangers,
Red Sox.  Not so good.  Braves, Cardinals, Diamondbacks, Mets.  Better.  At
least in the National League I have an excuse:  I'd picked the Giants
several times in the mid-90's and they were huge underachievers, so I didn't
think they could get out of the Dodger/Oriole mode.  I still can't figure
out how the A's &amp; White Sox made it in, but they deserve several votes in
the manager/general manager of the year balloting.  I would point out that
despite the fact that they made it in everyone is still surprised by it,
since no one thought payrolls that low would be playing in October.  So I'll
stick to something I know, like auto racing.  I picked Bobby Labonte to win
the NASCAR title (he's first with 6 races left) and Paul Tracy to win the
CART title (he's second with 2 races left).  How'd you do with your picks?
<i>((See some of the back and forth that I pulled and published above.
I'll stick with my bet of the Cardinals to win it all.))</i>

<p>
(JAMES to WORLD): In another month we can stop talking about this 
baseball nonsense and start in on college basketball.  The Orange have 
been picked to finish in the middle of their half of the Big East with 
Seton Hall clearly the team to beat in the league.  I think SU will 
surprise some people and come in no worse than third.  Also, watch out 
for the future as they are one recruit away from having the best 
recruiting class in the nation for next year.

<p>
(DREW to STEVE): Are you trying to convince Jim-Bob that this is the 
first time you have ever been this small?  I don't buy it for a second 
despite your stellar play in the last game.  Oh yea, putting the knife 
in was definitely more fun than gettin' it myself.  Sort of ironic that I
passed up the stab opportunity in this game after what happened last 
game.  I must of been thinking that you were playing Germany again.

<p>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY II): Thanks for trying to make the stab quick and 
painless even if it turned out more bloody than you expected.  The 
thought is what counts.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - TURK IN EXILE): Sooner or later we'll get
around to finishing you off. Just keep sending press,
it's a real gas to read. I'm sure Russ thinks so too.

<p>
(KURT - RUSS): The truth? Hey, ``the truth is out
there"- `The X Files.' Damn good show. Can't wait
for the new season.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/

<p>
2) Egypt can retreat into a Spanish home supply center during the Autumn retreats.
As we previously established, this occurs before Winter center counts, so that
would shift one center from Spain to Egypt.
I think I have all of the Winter choices correct above.
Someone will let me know if I don't.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Knuckles white with anger, 
taste of ashes in your mouth; 
Nothing like a slap right across your face... There's nothing I like better;
Than a vicious cold vendetta...
Revenge ain't so sweet, but it'll have to do;
Revenge is about as sweet as the way I feel about you.''
The incomparable Sally Timms growling ``Revenge" off of <i>So Good It Hurts</i>.
I think I've used parts of this quote before, but I was inspired by a
great review of this album at:
http://polyholiday.com/guide/M/mekons.html

<p>
By the way, while this reviewer thinks this particular Mekons album is their best
(and doesn't Eric Ozog agree??), I think that I can agree with everything he
says and still cite two or three others as their best, depending on my mood.
This is why they still are the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.

<p>
(UKRAINE - BOOB):  Help, aliens have abducted me and taken me
to a Star Trek convention!
<i>((The Star Trek press this time came in a bit late and I don't have
time to type it, so I'm holding it for next time..... we have a few other
tidbits though.))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): Sorry guy, but a man with nothing to lose has everything to gain.

<p>
(GERMANY-UKRAINE): We were misquoted in the Black press last season.  
We're not asking for ``help"; we're
urging you to help yourself (to the British dots in Russia).

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY 2): Besides I expected to get backstabbed on this move.

<p>
(ITA-SPA): Yes, a stab is a definite possibility.  However, GUI's (for now)
best interest now is to see BES whither and die first.  And if I do get
stabbed by one, I will ally with the other to stop a win, even if it
means throwing my dots to the one who stayed loyal to the Pope. 

<p>
(THE REICH to ITALIA): We don't even know you (or your intentions) 
anymore.... 

<p>
(ITA-EGY): Of course those G/U dot-grabbing manuevers you propose could
happen, and if it does, so be it.  Italy's in a tough position being in
the middle.  But I'm hoping that GUI stays true and Egypt goes down
first.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The HJR draw proposal passes!  
Chef proposed a China-Holland-England-France draw
but was TOO late!!

<p>
2) ``Shut it down'' is a term in vogue in this area because of its use
regarding the end of the baseball season for the disappointing Boston
Red Sox.  
Pedro Martinez ``shut it down'' after his last start a week before
the end of the season.
The Red Sox then went on a run (with a couple of other players also
having ``shut it down'') while the Yankees were losing and it seemed
for awhile as if the ``shut down'' Pedro might be needed for that
last game of the season.
As should be obvious, the term was not repeated with praise attached
to it.
Still, here, for this variant (which we shant be running again in this
szine, I don't believe) perhaps the phrase has more meaning.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
After an 18-hour flight, those lovable kids are back from Amsterdam
to South Park.  Only three went missing in the City of Sin, and 
the school officials have assured us that the rumors of marijuana use
are ``probably exaggerated".  

<p>
Mr. Mackey, the school counselor, was available for this comment: 
``Gee, the sky is pretty and blue today."  

<p>
Here are some more tidbits from their press conference.  (Remember
that these four kids are not only elementary school children in
Colorado, but also leaders of the powerful Dutch Indonesian fleet,
as a service to President Ronald ``Dutch" Reagan.)

<p>
Cartman:  HEY!  WHO VETOED MY DRAW!  I'm SOOO Mad I could ....arrgh!

<p>
(Cartman rips a juicy one.  Flames, you know, the whole bit.)

<p>
Kyle:  Please, folks, just accept the inevitable.  Don't make this
too hard on yourselves.  And than means you, Satan!

<p>
(Cartman cuts another one.)

<p>
Stan: Yeah, 'cause we got Jesus on our side!  Jesus, you'll make
sure the good guys win, won't you? 

<p>
Jesus:  Leave me alone.
