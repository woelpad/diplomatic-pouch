<p><br><p><br>``The general smiled as he imagined the confusion behind the enemy
line - first sending units over to its left, then frantically
trying to shift them as the true danger was revealed.
Vega loved the chaos and confusion of battle - as long as it
was behind the enemy's lines.''  -  Larry Bond, <i>Vortex</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Thanks to Mike Barno for this header quote and the new quote
for the Games Section lead in.
This is a really boring ``get the results out issue''.  
No apologies.
I'm holding some letters that I didn't have time to type in.
Watch the next deadline holding pretty close to Christmas....
I won't actually produce the szine until after Christmas,
in all likelihood.
Get me orders before you go away for the holidays or suffer
the consequences!

<p>
Note that the next <i>Octopus's Garden</i> is in the centerfold.
The choo-choo game has started!
Note that Pete is the person to ask if you're interested in choo-choo
games - convince him to start another one.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada. 
You can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to #186 are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the 
pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP directory in compressed postscript format.
I have been behind on getting this updated as I await a format
change.
We'll get all that straightened out soon.
The gracious assistance of Kevin Roust is most appreciated
in keeping up this site.
The files begin ap131.ps.Z and go sequentially from there.
The Caltech site is at:

<p>
ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/WWW/

<p>
or check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch 
at its brand new address with all of
the information you would need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
 
http://diplom.org/DipPouch

<p>
In addition, through Jamie McQuinn's portion of the Pouch, or directly
through:

<p>
http://diplom.org/pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP/

<p>
you can access the mirror site to Caltech and get to the szine that way.

<p>
I'm about to take the szine to HTML as an Internet format instead of
PDF, which wasn't working very well.
I'll have this set up later this month some time.
More next issue.....

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR MIKE MILLS</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>In a real surprise, Gary Coughlan has found Mike Mills!!
That's two people found in two issues.
I had kinda lost track with Gary too, so it was good to hear from him.
Now, the question is, does Mike want to standby in the <i>Zine Register</i>
Invitational??

<p>
I will announce another ``mark'' in Issue #200.
I'm always taking suggestions.
While we're waiting, find some of these guys below!
Give yourself a Christmas present!!
I really want someone to track down Kevin Tighe, for whom we
started this contest in the first place.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck
or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mike Mills (Wed Nov 19 1997 19:02:38 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
Jim,
Gary Coughlan (<i>Europa Express</i>) posted me to say that at 
one time in the near-past you were looking for me.  
If so, here I am: if not, there I go...
<i>((No, no, welcome back!!
Wow, I didn't even know that Gary was following what I was doing.
Do you know how I can contact HIM?  Gary has now won a $25 prize
for finding you.  You have earned a lifetime subscription to my
Diplomacy szine (approaching its 200th issue) and a potential
standby position in ``The Zine Register Invitational" which was
a game I started among as many former publishers of the various
Dipzine compendiums as I could find.  Since I couldn't find YOU,
I started this ``search for" contest.  We already have found
Scott Hanson and Doug Beyerlein, each of whom were lost from
the Hobby for about a decade.  Jerry Lucas is among the people
still ``missing".))</i>

<p>
Anyhow, I see that people still play Dip, 
and I see that it's played with a
Judge via email....neat trick.......
<i>((It's also being played in the ``old fashioned" way.  
I use both processes in my Dipszine called <b>The Abyssinian Prince</b>.))</i>
Anyhow, thought I would drop in and chat......

<p>

<center>Mike, VtHomes of together.net</center><br>

<p>
PS:  I pubbed <i>Emhain Macha</i> (ca 79-86)
<i>((Oh, yes, I remember you well!
We actually played in a game together in <i>Europa Express</i>.  
Jerry Lucas used a character called the ``virgin".
I think the game was called something like Iliad.
Thanks for responding.  Do you want to say anything about what you've
been up to for print in my szine?  As I last recall (and I could have the
details fuzzy) you left the hobby when someone in your family became
sick.  I hope you and your family are doing well today.))</i>

Now that sounds familiar, but to tell you the truth a 10 year

<p>
<i>((On circumstances of leaving the hobby...))</i>
Yea, that was around 85-86.  How would you remember?  
(We must've been allies in Iliad and the replacement stabbed you!)  
Yea, I'll writ you something: what do you like?  
I mean, what sort of things do you put in your szine?  
Does szine still mean SubZine?
<i>((Here are a couple of samples for you to look at.
Although I did start as a subszine, that isn't the intent.
It's supposed to be a ``pronunciation'' note to show how
NOT to pronounce it like the East Coast Clique (Kathy Byrne Caruso
and hubby John, Tom Swider, etc.).  The ``s'' softens the
sound.))</i>

<p>
Hey Jim,
I've just gotten this computer so I'm still learning my way around it like 
how to paragraphs-but it is making my life easier as far as keeping in 
contact with friends old and new.	Hence I owe you an apology of sorts.  Last year you kindly sent me a few issues of your zine 
after I responded to a former pubbers' gift of a current 
hobby zine from a guy named Kent who also had a good zine
(Would you tell him that?).
<i>((He can read it himself.
You're welcome!
Doug Kent funded that activity out of what he made from winning the
``find Doug Beyerlein'' part of the contest.
So it is interesting how things ``came around''.
You have to decide how to spend YOUR 25 buck prize now!))</i>

<p>
In your zine you were searching for dippers of the past, specifically Michael Mills.  
I had lost contact with him but this past summer he wrote me and since 
I would be getting a computer soon, 
I waited and answered him this week via email.
I told him about your contest.   
I got in from work tonight with an email from him saying 
he had contacted you. I knew then I should  do what I should have 
done long ago and write you thanking you for the zine issues.  
And since Mike enclosed your email address I can now say Thanks.
	
I hope all it well with you and yours,

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION 
(WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>
The call goes out for special Issue #200 letters on music!
From this point on, I reserve the right to hold letters or portions of
letters for that issue.
It will appear toward the end of January after a six week or so hiatus.
I intend to have this set of submissions have two parts (submit your
thoughts on one or both, but NOT neither!): 

<p>
a) Your thoughts on what music of 1997 meant to you - possibly in
the form of top (whatever number) CDs, favorite/memorable concerts,
zapper singles that made you jump out of your chair, or whatever
form you like! - which can be a list, or it can have lots of 
discussion/comments.
For me this has been the most fascinating music year in some time,
what about for you?
Can't you at least give me ONE song that stood out to you?
Sure you can.

<p>
b) Your thoughts on how music has changed/progressed/declined over
the approximately 13 year history of this szine's focus on music
issues (choose a relevant time window of your own if you like -
that's the primary range I'll be looking at).
This could be a new or revaluation of a list of your top CD/records
of the decade/century or it could take a discussion format.
The main point is that it be YOUR story.
Your story does count (much as I realize that many of you don't
seem to think I believe that).
Originally, I was going to do a list (and I still may) but 
I am now leaning to something more verbal.

<p>
You can also combine the two questions to say something very short and simple.
I even want to hear from those of you who would
say something like this (for example): ``I grew up in the 70's listening
to Yes, Genesis, and Renaissance and you know what?
That's all I still like to listen to.
Well, except, Anthony Phillips has another great album out this year.''
Then I can ask: ``Great! Where can I find it??''
Give it a ride!

Hi Jim Bob:
I finally got close enough to our computer to actually write you some

How is your family?  Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving.

<p><br><p><br><b>Steve Emmert (Wed, 12 Nov 1997 12:56:25 -0500)</b>

<p>
Bon jour, mon ami - (I was in Quebec recently.)

<p>
I've done a bit of travelling since I last wrote.  Not for a very good reason
- my doctor basically ordered me to take two weeks off from work and
get out of town - but I needed and enjoyed the trip.  Sondra blessed me,
saying that I had earned some time to myself (I've had solo kid duty for
probably about ten to twelve months total while she's been on the road,
so I could do this with a clean conscience).
<i>((This could happen to me.....))</i>

<p>
I only had four rules:  (1)  Stay off the Interstates where practical; (2)
Visit my grandmother in Indiana; (3)  See a couple of hockey games; and
(4)  Do not think about work.

<p>
I stuck to these rules and had a great time.  I saw places I'd never seen
before, including the Kentucky horse country, the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan, central Ontario, and the Green Mountains of Vermont.  I
stopped in many wonderful small towns - my favorites were Maysville,
Ky., Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and Rutland. Vt. - and drove through
countless others.  I saw stunning views of Lake Huron and the Ottawa
River.  I saw two hockey games, one in Detroit (Mike Vernon's return as
a member of the Sharks) and one in Montreal (perhaps the greatest
rivalry in hockey history, Maple Leafs and Canadiens).  I found my
grandmother to be in better health than my uncle had warned me.  I drove
as far as I wanted and stopped when I felt like it.  I had sevruga caviar
and roasted wild boar in a Russian restaurant in Montreal, and plain old
spaghetti and meatballs in a pizza joint in Grayling, Michigan.  
I bought 45
bagels in New York City for my wife, an exiled New Yorker.  I got an
enormous stuffed kangaroo, complete with lil' joey in pouch, for Caroline;
it's about as big as she is.  I listened to recorded books:  A biography of
Churchill, Jack London's The Sea Wolf, The Aeneid; some Louis L'Amour
cowboy stories, and a God-awful version of Moby Dick that is read by (I
should say ``butchered by") Burt Reynolds.  I found Detroit's art museum
to be more to my taste than Montreal's.  I put 3,300 miles on my car.

<p>
How many guys get to do this?  (I mean the married ones.  The single
ones have the freedom to do it, but maybe not the inclination and the
cash.)  Probably the best sign was that I thoroughly enjoyed every
minute of the trip (well, maybe not my one and only traffic jam, in
Louisville), but the best part was getting home to my wife and my rotten
little girl.  If you DREAD going home after a trip like that, then 
you've got problems.

<p>
By the way, you may know that Jacobs Field in Cleveland is referred to
as "The Jake" and that Turner Field in Atlanta is ``The Ted."  You may
even know that the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit is ``The Joe."  But did you
know that Montrealers call the new Molson Centre ``The Keg"?

<p>
I'd better stop reminiscing now, or you're likely to take me off the sub list.
<i>((Not bloody likely....))</i>

<p>
Are you and Charlotte well?  Best wishes.

<p>

<center>Steve, SEMMERT of city.virginia-beach.va.us</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Seriously, though, we are both doing very well, just very busy.
Christmas season tends to be extremely crazy for us, as for us all,
but Charlotte's and my work schedules always actually get busier 
around this time of year, not a good combination.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mike Barno (11/13/97)</b>

<p>
Jim asked me for ``perspective'' on Mike Stefanik winning two racing
series championships (NASCAR Modified Tour and NASCAR Busch North
Series) in the same year.
I'm darn impressed, and so are most people.
Both series are very competitive and Stefanik had to have private
planes fly him between racetracks some weekends.

<p>
He raced at Shangri-La (now Tioga) Speedway a few times when I was 
handicapper there in the mid-Eighties.
Those appearances were in Modifieds owned by Sonny Koszela
who won national championships in the Sixties and Seventies with 
Bugs Stevens driving.
(Stefanik married Koszela's daughter Julie, a good r&#233;sum&#233;-enhancement
tool.)

<p>
NASCAR Modifieds are 750-horsepower, 2600-pound purpose-built monsters,
much faster than the stock-front-end, claimer-engine cars called 
``modifieds'' by the sanctioning body IMCA.
My tenure in the sport spanned the conversion of the nearly
unlimited asphalt modifieds from a featured weekly division
into a touring series.
And frankly, they had to make that change.
Why?
Because guys were buying $10,000 cars and $20,000 engines to race for
$1000 to win.
Half the field would buy a $700 set of tires every night, and the other 
teams would be slower than them, on used tires.
People couldn't afford to race.
The Tour helped bring a schedule of good-paying big shows together,
and has slowly led to better sponsorships and TV appearances.
Most weekly tracks have changed to cheaper (more limited) rules, or 
dropped modifieds entirely.

<p>
Background: In the northeastern US, modified coupes and sedans from the
1930s became the dominant form of auto racing in the early Fifties.
It was a natural breeding ground for ``Yankee ingenuity''.
Differences between dirt-track and paved-track cars were minimal
until the early Seventies.
Dirt modifieds became high, big-block-Chevy (467 c.i. from a 454 block)
cars with the driver straddling the driveshaft - almost like sprint
cas with partial Gremlin bodies.
Asphalt modifieds became low, offset, small-block-Chevy (368 c.i. from
a 350 block) cars.
Because a chassis with less flex lets a suspension control tire motions
better, they built cars so stiff that, when one hit a wall hard, it 
passed on the impact force to the driver.
Several times in the Eighties, Modified drivers (including Richie
Evans, Tony Jankowiak, Corky Cookman, and Tom Druar, all friends of mine)
died because of these forces, in wrecks that didn't appear to severely
damage the cars.
Today more deformability is required.

<p>
As for the Busch North Series, it's basically NASCAR's
Busch Series (Grand National) cars, run on short ovals (and two road
courses) where they've always run some sort of Late Models,
usually under NASCAR's aegis.
A popular stepping stone to the big leagues.

<p>
A little more on the NASCAR Modifieds: Bob Park, a Long Island-based racer,
traveled all over the East Coast contending for the national Modified
championship when there was no tour, and his brother Bill also was
(and is) a capable modified driver.
When Bob first put his son Steve Park in a modified away from their
home track, it was at Shangri-La (now Tioga), where I determined starting
lineups and was part of the scoring team.
They chose Shangri-La because of its wide half-mile size and open
slide-off areas, compared to the tight quarter-miles (frequent car-to-car
contact) with concrete walls (HARD car-to-wall contact potential)
on Long Island (Islip and Riverhead).

<p>
The point?
Oh, sorry.
After excelling in modifieds, Steve Park was picked to drive Dale Earnhardt's
Busch Series car this year.
He kicked butt, won three races, and easily took the Rookie of the Year
honors.
Earnhardt is starting his own team in the Winston Cup series
(while continuing to drive for Richard Childress), and he's moving
Steve up to be his driver.

<p>
Also moving up to the big league is Todd Bodine; but unlike his 
brothers Geoff and Brett Bodine, Todd hasn't run modifieds.
Their father's racetrack, Chemung Speedrome,
closed right after middle brother Brett got started in a
street stock.  (It will reopen in late 1998.)
Todd went south to work for his brothers, and started driving
in Virginia or North Carolina.
(But Todd's current teammate, Mike McLaughlin, made his name in
dirt modifieds, then switched to pavement mods at Shangri-La 
during my tenure.)

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>It's time to at least think about another game opening.
What is really attractive to me is to run Vincent Mous' Modern
Diplomacy ten player variant.
There are about 50 supply centers and it is set across a map 
slightly more expansive than the original's European map.
This game is very popular on the Judges and has been written
about by Chris Warren in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83.
If I get one more person interested, I'll print the rules and officially
announce a game opening.
Currently, Eric Ozog, Brad Wilson, 
and Harry Andruschak have expressed interest.
If not, I'll wait until another regular game or two ends before
starting another regular Diplomacy game.
There also are some potential surprises developing on this front.
You'll all know more soon.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny,
John Schultz, and Harry Andruschak are signed up.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
I'm also STRONGLY thinking of opening a game of Breaking Away.
Is there any interest??
You don't need to own the game to play, I'm going to use 
Keith Thomasson's house rules that include the ``how to play the game.''
I printed Keith's rules last time, but some of the shaded parts
didn't reproduce properly.
I'll print the rules properly if I get interest in the game.
I thank John Harrington, the game's inventor, for provisionally 
allowing approval for this.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Don Williams has a new E-Mail address.

<p>
2) No map in this issue.
Depending on space constraints, I may be a little more restrictive
in how many maps I publish here since they take up a whole page.
Note again that I am using the standard Diplomacy dates for this
game (following the lead of Jamie McQuinn) rather than starting with
1870 and having ``yearly'' seasons.
I don't care what you write on your orders.

<p>
3) I have been asked about various and sundry rule changes, some of which
I gather have been published in <i>The General</i>, which I don't get.
Here's the facts, we are using the revised rule on the Suez Canal
that prevents the Paradox from occurring.
If anyone has a copy of that rule to send to me, I'd appreciate it.
At some point, I'll find the issue that I published it in (back around
175-180 or so), but it can't happen until there is a ``crowd" around Suez,
so I'm not in a great rush.
As far as Sakhalin goes, I believe strongly in leaving it ``surrounded''
by the single water province.
In practical fact it allows a power to ``hole'' up there and demand to
be included in a draw since they can't be dislodged.
Then again, somebody can ignore them and go on and win the game.
I believe very strongly in KEEPING the quirks that affect each power
that you have to keep in mind.
The designer clearly put in at least one such quirk to affect each player,
except perhaps the Dutch.
I've written about this some elsewhere and probably will again as the
game goes on. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TIM RICE QUOTE OF THE MONTH): 

<p>
``We've stripped war down to essentials, We don't waste no time or flesh.

<p>
Beautiful is our destruction, Clean and fresh.

<p>
You don't have to follow leaders, You don't have to choose a side.

<p>
No opinions volunteered from the millions who've died.

<p>
Don't feel you're a pawn or private, You can be the rank you choose.

<p>
Not that it makes any difference, You lose." 

<p>
``Overture" from <i>1984</i>.

<p>
(CHINA-FRANCE): Sorry about the bounce. I promise not to do it again. Maybe if
you wrote once in a while we could avoid such unpleasantness.

<p>
(JAPAN-ALL): I apologize for the lack of communication.
I have been very busy in school and I have my damn college applications
to write.

<p>
(CHINA-RUSSIA): If you tried to take Manchuria the results will be most
unfortunate. 

<p>
(JAPAN-CHINA): I have no problem with fleets as long as they don't show up 
near my waters.
That means please don't build any fleets in anything but Canton.

<p>
(CHINA-TURKEY): I'd like to know what mantra you use to avoid stress and heart
failure. Is it, ``He won't attack me, ommmmmmm. He won't attack me, ommmmmm."

<p>
(THE TURKISH CASTLE): The Toadfather wandered around his sumptuous palace,
oblivious to the loss of money and furniture that the reception had cost him.
``Mercenaries," he muttered. ``Do I really need them?" Just as that point, a
large scraggly and obviously drunken man bounded in his general direction.
The stranger took a drink of the punch that had been put out and yelled out
to no one in particular. ``THAT CAN'T BE THE GREAT TOADFATHER; I'M PRETTIER
THAN THIS MAN!!" The Toadfather walked up to him and said, ``You're drunk,
friend," at which the stranger pulled out a knife and held it to his own
throat. ``Drunk enough to get a dagger past the Imperial guards. Tell me, old
man. if I fight for you, will I get to kill Englishmen?" The Toadfather
stepped back, stunned by his oddness and bravado. ``Yes, you'll get to kill
the English." 

<p>
The stranger pulled the knife down and screamed, ``EXCELLENT!!! Richard is my
name, and I'm the most wanted man on my island, but I'm not ON my island."
The Toadfather looked at him incredulously and asked, ``What island is that?
Hainan?"

<p>
The stranger shook his head, ``No, not that old rock. Sumatra is my island.
Suuuuuuuummmmmaaaaaattttrrrrrraa, Borneo too," he slurred. ``It's MINE!" The
Toadfather looked around at the sycophants that had gathered for the
reception. None had impressed him like this stranger. He looked him up and
down and stated, ``You're a madman." The stranger climber up on an Ottoman and
started laughing maniacally. Everyone left him to his madness, except the
host. ``Come with me. We have plans to make..." and the two madmen walked off
together.

<p>
(TURKISH CASTLE (one floor down, twelve rooms to the right)):  
Blue Daf woke from a delicious afternoon nap 
and found that she was alone.  She stretched
and lay on the cool sheets a minute longer, savoring the 
feeling left behind by the man who had just recently left her bed.  
   
Had it been only a few short weeks ago that she had woken up in this room
with her head spinning?  He had been very kind to her and provided her 
with everything she needed.  
She still didn't know for sure what had happened.  
As a matter of fact, if the Khan had not heard stories about her 
from far away, she would not even know her own name.  
But he told her he had heard of a tall, strong woman who 
had long blonde hair and a birthmark shaped like the
head of a panther.  
It was told that she could fight like a demon.  It seems
this woman had disappeared from the face of the earth not long 
before she showed up on his doorstep.  
She still didn't feel like she knew who she was.

<p>
It wasn't that she doubted the Khan - why would he lie to her?  But
something didn't feel quite right.  She had been dazed and delirious 
the first week she arrived.  
Visions of ducks and huge hairy barbarians flitted
through her fevered dreams.  
Little by little however, she had started to feel better, stronger.  
But there were still times when she would look in the
mirror and not quite recognize the woman staring back at her.
   
Blue Daf got out of bed and picked up the clothes that had been tossed to
the floor earlier.  They were in shades of blue, supposedly the only color
she wore, with winnebagos and beersteins embroidered on them.  She wondered
to herself why the color did not please her more.  She walked out of 
the room and was heading down towards the kitchens when she 
heard a voice which echoed in her soul.  
She stopped dead, listening for that voice again.  When she
heard it, she started running up the stairs.  
It sounded like it was coming from the Khan's informal meeting chamber....

<i>Game Notes (firmly orbiting in the tropopause):</i>

<p>
1) Tentative congratulations are given to Mike Barno!
There are a few weird things that could happen on the
last move, but nothing that I can see that would stop
Mike from winning.
Mike showed that starting slow can be an advantage.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(JOHN-HARRY): Sorry!
You had the unfortunate luck to be in second place.
You're assured an 18 point finish.
See ya' next time.
Hope you enjoyed your vacation, even if it wasn't
to the sunny ``beaches'' of Antarctica.

<p>
(SKYWALKER-ALL): This turn ought to be interesting, yet I doubt
I'll win.
<i>((Looks like you have managed a tie for second place with John
though....))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-RANDY ELLIS): Despite your announced intentions to nuke
me in the last round, you are just too pathetic for me to nuke you in
return.  Go back to sucking your Old Milwaukee Light, and please leave
us grownups alone.

<p>
(RANDY to MIKE): What did you think of Stuart's artistic skills??

<p>
(De vanitate, 1530): ``Understande you therefore now, that there
needeth not muche labour in this place, but faithe and praier: not the 
studie of longe time, but humbleness of spirite and cleannesse of Hart:
not the sumptuous furniture of many bookes, but a pure understanding,
and made fitte for the truthe as the keye is for the locke: for the
greater number of bookes chargeth the learner, instructeth him not.
And he that followeth many authours erreth with many.''

<p>
(TRANSYLVANIA-WORLD): For lovers of horror stories, I have discovered
an early work by Stephen King that was published under a pseudonym.
A cat with supernatural powers terrorizes two lonely children,
trashes their house, and tortures their pets.
I recommend <i>The Cat in the Hat</i> if you don't mind graphic violence.

<p>
(JOHN BOY-BOOB): Harry's cool.
He likes those hopeless standbys, too.
I don't understand why people don't knock down the door
for those spots.
When there's nothing to lose you're free to try anything.
Oh-wow!
Sorry to Janis Joplin.
I didn't realize I was treating her lyrics so badly.

<p>
(BARNO to RAUTERBERG, YOU OLD ROADWORM): My favorite Deep Purple tune
is ``Elephant Talk''.
Bet you could get some good Dip press out of those lyrics without
changing a word....

<p>
(MIKE to JEFF): ``I wish I were a little rock, A-sitting on a hill,

<p>
A-doing nothing, all day long, But just a-sitting still.'' - Frederick
Latimer

<p>
(WORLD to JEFF): To do is to be.
To do nothing is to be nothing.''

<p>
(BING CROSBY to WORLD): ``Do be do be do.''

<p>
(from A FORMER ANGRY YOUNG MAN, no longer young, but not as old as Harry):
Samuel Fuller, a reporter, war hero, and film producer/writer/director,
died October 30.
What I noticed was not just his films' challenge to war, communism,
racism, and the atom bomb in the post-WWII era, but the title of his first
pulp novel: <i>Burn Baby Burn</i>, published in 1935.
I had thought that phrase originated with H. Rap Brown around 1965.
(Or a bit earlier; when were the Watts riots?)

<p>
(MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME): ``...a simple compound called butyl
mercaptan, a very volatile liquid that can be shot into'' (polluters')
``houses with the use of a syringe.... This sulfur compound smells about 
the same as the main component in a skunk's defense system....
Mix two parts of butyl bromide to one part of sodium hydrogen
sulfide and warm the mixture.''
(from <i>Ecotage!</i>, edited by Sam Love and David Obst.)

<p>
(AN EYE FOR AN EYE): ``The Cong had cut off his head, slit open his belly,
and stuffed his head into it.
Their usual treatment for any GI found carrying dum-dum bullets.
They're the bullets that make a one-inch hole going in and a 
twelve-inch hole coming out.''
(Bob Hope, <i>Five Women I Love</i>.)

<p>
(IT'S GOOD TO STAY ALERT): ``Killed by Crow Indians, the two men's
heads had been cut off and stuck on the points of their picks with the
other points stuck into the ground.
Their tin cups had been placed in front of their heads, apparently
to tell others that the two had been surprised while eating.''
(Lee Whittlesey, <i>Death in Yellowstone</i>.)

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): I returned from vacation on Friday the 14th, and
<i>TAP</i>-197 arrived on Monday the 17th.
Obviously, my worries about missing deadlines were unfounded.

<p>
To answer your question, I arranged for you to have a one year sub
to <i>FOSFAX</i>.
Pay attention in future issues to the back page where you will be
informed when your sub runs out.
You may send trade copies back if you wish, although I am not sure
how interested the <i>FOSFAX</i> people might be in a Dip zine.
Can't hurt to try, as there is some overlap between SF fandom
and games fandom.
And I am sure they would be happy to give details of your e-mail
access to their readership.

<p>
As for something special about music for issue #200, that would be
a problem.
With zilch interest in pop music, I have no idea what new music 
came out in 1997.
And about the only important thing I can think about the last 13 years
is the total triumph of the CD over the LP and the huge number of
classical re-releases that have resulted.
A deluge of historic performances.
``It's warm in here, isn't it?''
``Not if you're a pianist.''
<i>((Well, I think you can be a lot more detailed about that.
Where there is a deluge there is a place for carefully managed flows.
Your choice.
I'd like some classical musings for balance!))</i>

<p>
Your enthusiasm about getting the Modern Diplomacy game underway
reminds me that I wanted to ask the <i>TAP</i> readership a question.
I haven't played in all that many variants, but I have wondered if
anybody has strong opinions as to the best number of starting players?
Modern Dip (and things like Stonehenge Dip) have 10 players, while 1499
has only 5 players to start.
Three questions: What do you think is the smallest number of beginning
players for a viable game?
The largest number?
The ideal number?
(I am sure many will answer this last question with ``7'' but I wonder
if that is just a knee-jerk reflex or a carefully considered response.)
<i>((I'll give you my quick shot.
For me it would be five, then somewhere between ten and fifteen, and
finally, yes, seven.
For smaller numbers (3, 5, 7, 9) it is important to have an odd number
of players to induce some instability, but around nine you have enough
so that it doesn't matter.
By instability, I mean you don't want people to pair up in simple 
pairs and then stay allied for the whole game (at least I don't).
To me, a viable game means that you have switching alliances and
shifting strategies that keeps things dynamic.
Once you get above ten the game starts to break down into regional
battles that are independent.
It can be possible to do well, or even win, without dealing with the
players on the other side of the board at all.
This seems to go beyond the concept of ``one'' game.
Seven is a great balancing number between these two.
I'm convinced it's the ``right'' number in that sense.))</i>

<p>
As for entering a lot of games in <i>TAP</i>, I think not.
NYEED is rather easy when you use the tit-for-tat strategy, one dot
standby positions do not require being a rocket scientist to play
(even though at one time I would have been considered a ``rocket
scientist''), and you will note that I am not interested in
Breaking Away.
This leaves whatever is the one Diplomacy type game you may consider.

<p>
As for the choo-choo game, I know nothing about such, but could become
interested if I did not have to shell out large sums of money
on boards, maps, and rules.
Any GMs running train games should feel free to write me about this.

<i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The concessions to Russia and France are defeated.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(VON STEUBEN to THE ALLIES): Of course we haven't given up!!
However, things are starting to look ugly on the Russian front.
The Hungarian third infantry division was pushed out of Serbia
back to Trieste.
With dwindling resources and capital, we were forced to disband
50% of the Austro-Hungarian fleet.
We are relying a great deal, now, on our English, French, and
German allies.
No matter the odds, surrender is <i>not</i> an option.
We must stop the Great Satan!!

<p>
(SKYWALKER-ALL): I make one comment and you all have to make fun 
of me.

<p>
(SERBIA): Amidst heavy artillery fire from the east, the Austro-Hungarian
garrison in Serbia reluctantly retreated to a more defensible position
to the west.
Russian troops poured in from Bulgaria and Rumania and the Great Satan,
Tsar Sherwood, immediately imposed martial law.
Russian soldiers, in a drunken frenzy, are burning down whole villages,
raping women, children, and an occasional effeminate man, and defecating
in many cities' water supplies.
It comes as a surprise to some that the Russians would treat their 
Slavic brethren so barbarically.
Panic has taken hold in Budapest and in Athens.
There are incessant rumors that the Austro-Hungarian government
is relocating their capitol to Venice or Rome.
Europe, it seems, is about to experience the greatest cataclysm
since the Black Plague decimated one third of the population
in the Middle Ages.
Is there any hope for the free world??
It appears grim.

<p>
(AUSTRIA-HUNGARY to THE ALLIES): You will all hear from me shortly.

<p>
(RANDY to ALL): Well, I'm in Florida at long last.
It's interesting here in Everglades National Park.
Tomorrow I'll take a skiff (and lots of mosquito repellent) and check
out some of the backcountry waterways.
Maybe I'll do a little shark fishing the following day.
I think I like it here....

<p>
(SKYWALKER to BOOB): Apparently your little vocab words did indeed help.
I took the SAT's again in Oct. and got 1320 (660M, 660V).
That is a 70 point increase in verbal.
I am forever in debt to you and the others who helped me with vocab.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
and Vince Lutterbie
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is presently
missing, so I am running low on standbys here...).
Mike Mills has been found, so tentatively he has been 
added to the list!!
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!
Although press in this szine is generally black, I will make the
exception here that I will say who has NPRed and is ``at risk''
for being dropped. 
Russia gets a reprieve as he is working on a ``special'' project
for me which will become apparent shortly.
It'll be worth waiting for, count on that.
Otherwise, Simon would be the only one back on the bubble for next 
time; however, instead we must bid him adieu!
Thanks, Simon, for sticking with the game, I hope you enjoyed it.
We'll keep you around at least until the end of the game anyway.

<p>
3) Note that Don has changed his E-Mail address.
Apparently, Keith was not on the ``A-List''.
We'll hear more about that, I'm sure!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(CHARLOTTE-BOSTON MUSIC MAVEN): The lyrics are from Juliana Hatfield's 
``I Got no Idols'' off her second solo album, <i>Become What You Are</i>. 
The album was released in 1993.
<i>((Ah, well, first of all, you're going to have to claim a new
handle.
Using my wife's name as your press handle is unlikely to score
points with the GM.
Hatfield has never been a favorite of mine; however, I'm generally
not very good with lyrics anyway.
Thanks for running this even though you didn't get much ``play''
from other press writers.))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY - GM): Ha ha, you were hoping I wouldn't submit any press, weren't 
you?  No more INXS albums, I hear their lead singer was found dead this 
morning.
<i>((Yeah?
Well, I always hated INXS, they ranked only slightly higher than Romeo
Void at the top of my least favorite groups of the eighties.
I'm not happy that anyone died, but I certainly won't miss the music any.
I'm sure most of you have heard the rumours about how he died....
let's just say the hanging looks like it was an ``accident''.))</i>

<p>
(PARIS to SICILY): Farewell thee, duce, we hear the bell.
                                  
For one more coward, prig and swell.

<p>
(GERMANY - ALL): Anyone with books on Cape Breton in their personal 
libraries let me know.

<p>
(TURKEY-RUSSIA): I tried to send you e mail telling you Ank would be open

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Selected Broadcast Press (Endgame continued):</i>

<p>
(wenitch of earthlink.net as OBSERVER):
Just a few comments from the peanut gallery:

<p>
First, I must say that watching this game been an experience and an education.
I've seen things done and said both inside and outside the game that have
fascinated, intrigued and shocked me, things that I wouldn't have thought of
doing or even dreamed of doing. It wasn't so much the moves that made the stabs,
but the subtleties that led up to them that I found so educational. Watching a
game of all top caliber players is something I think every novice or
intermediate level player should do, even if they do nothing more than 
read the broadcast press and keep only the vaguest contact with what 
was actually going on in the game itself.

<p>
Secondly, watching this game made me understand why I underestimated 
Hohn so much in the two games I've played face-to-face with him. 
I had no idea who he was at the time, and both times he surprised 
me with his knowledge of the game and ability to
analyse and take advantage of situations as they arise. 
This may sound like unabashed flattery, but he is the only one 
of the Seven that I have met, and seeing him play
both FTF and on the Judge was educational in itself.

<p>
Finally, the perspectives brought into the `outside' discussions 
made them lively and nearly every broadcast was something worth reading. 
(Most of the time, anyway.)
For someone who is not in the `Inner Circle' of the Dip World, those
discussions shed light on topics that I had had only a cursory 
interest in before this game, and have
been firmly lodged in my thick skull until I have the time to fully 
pursue those subjects.

<p>
Congratulations to the Final Three, and thanks to everyone for playing 
in this game.  It was truly a joy to watch.

<p>
James Glass, Observer

<p>
<p><br>
<center>ENGLAND's eog comments on GHODSTOO (a first installment)</center><br>

<p>
Here I'll just remark on the endgame, while I have fresh thoughts about it.
First off, let me say that I was sorry to hear that Pitt had been ill. I
didn't know until he mentioned it recently on r.g.d.

<p>
The ending was fairly interesting, I thought. Leaving aside the question of
*when* Turkey would annihilate his Italian friend (there wasn't much
question about *whether*), the main issue seemed to be how and whether the
FEG coalition would hold together. The problem, as became very obvious, was
that it might/would become too easy for me and France to eliminate Germany
in the very final stages to reduce the draw. Pitt had to try to find some
way to make himself indispensible. His general approach seemed right, only
the details weren't sufficiently worked out.

<p>
As an aside, Edi asked whether it was really `worth the trouble'. But of
course, it was no trouble! Edi also noted that his attitude is that a draw
is exactly as good as being eliminated. Well, not to me!

<p>
Working backwards, in the last year there were few choices left. With my
fleet in Sweden, I could order it to Finland, and if I got there I would
have Stp locked. (I could prevent Turkey ever taking it, and eventually I
would be able to take it myself.) Similarly, it was a trivial matter to get
France into Berlin, consolidating his forces (which he desperately needed
to do to make sure of being able to block a Turkish win). Of course,
Germany could see this, and we could see that he could see it, and so on,
but all this knowledge was to no avail. If Germany wanted to throw the
game, this was his last chance. But in effect there was no more incentive
for him to threaten to throw it, since it would be a threat he would have
to carry out immediately. There was no promise, at *that* point, that he
could extract, no demands he could make. If he ordered Stp-Fin, or Ber-Kie,
he'd just be throwing it. If he didn't, he'd be eliminated. He was stuck.

<p>
Ideally, theoretically, I shouldn't have let this situation arise. For
Germany now had no incentive *not* to throw the game, either. I shouldn't
have let the position evolve into one in which Germany *could* throw the
game and had no incentive not to. I should have done something earlier to
prevent the situation from arising. I believe that the last moment to do
this was when I was considering capturing Sweden. If Pitt had strenuously
demanded that I leave it for him, and further than I *never* bring a unit
next to Finland, then I think he could have managed to survive. Maybe. I'm
not absolutely sure. Possibly Hohn could have backed away from the
stalemate line, far enough to make it possible for me to eliminate Germany
safely anyway.

<p>
In any case, in F1910 Pitt did ask me to leave Sweden for him, but he
didn't explain or threaten sufficiently for me to take him seriously. I
decided that he wasn't paying very close attention. (Actually I had decided
this much earlier.) [And I now figure it was because of his illness.] So I
took it, and I think at that point the ending was forced. With no more
threats, Pitt had to decide whether he was just going to throw it, or
whether he'd have to trust to my Gentle dispositions or something. I guess
he felt that there was enough of a chance that I'd want him around, just
for some unambitious, non-greedy reason. But I was still cutthroat enough
to want to reduce the draw, and for that matter to extract the final
revenge against the last suriviving power that had stabbed me earlier.

<p>
Maybe some of the late Italian moves should be counted as part of the
endgame. I guess the *late* Italian moves were all more or less irrelevant.
Once Turkey had surrounded the Boot, there appeared to be no hope at all of
Italian surivival.

<p>
I'll figure out what I wanted to say about the Opening and Midgames and
report back later.

<p>
(ENGLAND): There hasn't exactly been a flood of comments 
from the other players, huh?
I'll liven things up and do my part to prevent the game from actually 
expiring.

<p>
<p><br>
<center>ENGLAND's eog statement for GHODSTOO (another installment)</center><br>

<p>

<center><i>The Opening</center><br></i>

<p>
As the observers never discovered, and as at least many of the players I
think did know, there was a AIRE alliance at the outset. Edi suggested it.
I liked the idea. For one thing, as Edi noted, it would be unusual, and
that's a plus for a demo game. For another, it seemed to me that it would
be quite advantageous to me, England, if it all held up. And, of course,
what I feared most in the opening was a GF alliance against me, or a very
northward-leaning Russia, and the AIRE plan seemed to be a good way to
eliminate such potential problems. So I opened very strong toward France,
something I am not generally inclined to do.

<p>
Now, much of the diplomacy in the early phases was shot through with what I
can only call paranoia about Edi Birsan. I loved this. I tried to fan the
flames at every opportunity. The more everyone was looking at Austria (even
over their shoulders), the less trouble for me (so I thought!). And, if the
AIRE held up for a while, it meant that Russia and Italy would be thinking
of Austria as their next target, after the demise of the unalligned powers.
And that would surely be very good for me. I could just pick my channel of
expansion: the Mediterranean, over the top into Russia, or through the
middle with armies into Germany and then Central Europe. The prospects
appeared fine indeed.

<p>
But a huge problem emerged rapidly, to put it mildly. First, I'd failed to
count on Pitt being much cagier than the average player. This was really
stupid. I think my worst mistakes in the game were diplomatic, misjudging
the characters of the players. But my worst *strategic* mistake was in
overlooking how my opening would appear to Germany, and what he would be
most sensible to do in response. He quite rightly saw that I would be
growing alarmingly fast, and that I would be able to choose my enemies, if
France fell as rapidly as it looked like he might. And he saw me snatch
Belgium, appear very confident of being able to take Norway later (!!!),
with all signs of close ties to Italy and Russia. So he stabbed me when it
was most effective. This was strategically disastrous.

<p>
At the same time, the AIRE alliance fell to pieces, exactly because of the
Birsan-paranoia I had encouraged. Italy and Russia went for Austria. Russia
stole Norway. Italy let France off the hook. I was in big, big trouble. So
the turning point in the game came very, very early for me. Not only was my
tactical position wrecked, but my attitudes toward all the players changed.

<p>
First, I now had to view France as my potential savior, even though he was
the only power I had attacked - an uncomfortable situation! But I had some
hopes. I'd tried to stay on good terms with John even while I was invading
him; not that I really thought I'd ever need his goodwill, but you never
know.
Second, I had been thinking of Russia as my major ally, my ``last enemy"
(there are no lifelong friends in Diplomacy, your best friend is really
just your last enemy. Deep, isn't it?). But he'd just stuck me by taking
Norway. This was one of those (numerous) cases in which I am stabbed, and
because I'm taken by surprise I feel that the stab must have been a dumb
move (otherwise I would have expected it). (This was not the case when Pitt
stabbed me. I could see that the dumbness was mine there.) Russia was
fighting Turkey, he was stabbing Austria, and now he was opening a third
front! Insanity. I wanted to punish him, or at least I wanted it to emerge
that taking Norway was a really dumb move. I almost decided to chuck it all
and destroy the Russian position with my last gasps. But I decided to
inflict punishment by haranguing Mark endlessly instead. I think Mark will
agree that this was a pretty harsh punishment. :-)

<p>
Third, I now regarded Turkey as my only definite friend. I tried to make
use of him, but to no real avail. (I didn't blame him, either.)

<p>
Fourth, I felt that Italy's abandonment of the invasion of France was an
indirect stab of me.

<p>
And fifth, I felt that somehow Austria was responsible for the whole thing.
(So I guess some of that paranoia was rubbing off!)

<p>
Putting the goal of a really good finish on the back burner, I adopted as
my goal to see as many of my betrayers eliminated as possible before I felt
the final axe myself. (I hoped to get a little revenge against Germany,
too, but this was the lowest priority.) For this reason I decided to try to
hold out as long as I could, maybe exerting some diplomatic influence in
the midgame, rather than to play all my on-the-board cards at once to
avenge myself against Russia.

<p>
I have to say that I thought the Russian and Italian openings made no sense
at all. If they were going to stab Austria in 1902, it would have made a
lot more sense to begin in 1901 instead. As it worked out, Italy was way
out of position, and had to tip the attack by shifting his fleets eastward.
Russia got little out of 1901 except a Turkish enemy. Nor could I see
anything in particular that happened in 1901 that Russia and Italy couldn't
have expected beforehand. It's not as though it was a great surprise that
Italy couldn't just scoop up the French and Iberian centers quickly without
resistance! Everyone knows that is a difficult attack, one that bears fruit
only after a couple of years. (I'm really just saying this to get Cal and
Mark to say something. Oooh, maybe I'd better inform Mark that the game is
over!)
<i>((He knows, he knows...))</i>

<p>
The Opening portion of the game was awfully short, as far as I'm concerned.
Once the AIRE fell apart, after exactly one year!, the Opening was over for
me, I had to adjust my goals and strategies.
I guess I'll send in my thoughts about the midgame another time.

<p>
Jamie, formerly Gentle King

<p>
(EDI WROTE): If I had achieved 18 centers in a spring move and then turned 
around to you and said either vote for a two way to Hohn and I or face 
being a loser in a win you would have gone along with the 2 way...and 
Hohn knows that I would have voted for it also just to make a point.

<p>
(HOHN REPLIES): <font face="symbol"> &lt; </font
>boggle<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
>

<p>
First of all, how do you figure you could have <i>gotten</i> to 18, Edi?
Or anywhere close?  Let's talk specific center distribution, please.
Under what possible circumstances could this scenario exist?  How
would we have gotten there?

<p>
Second, if you think I'd have gone along with any of the above that
you suggest, demo game or no, history of working well together or no,
you are badly mistaken.

<p>
I'm all for negotiated two-ways in FTF games, where DIAS is not a
factor.  But my level of paranoia ramps way, way up in DIAS games, and
if any ally of mine is on the verge of victory, I'll generally try to
either take the victory myself or make sure my ally doesn't steal it.
Usually this requires either carefully planned expansion, or a
third-party buffer state.  Alternatively, on extremely rare occasions
(and I did this in a game called ``shadow," where France and my England
split a two-way just because of the incredible synchronicity and
goodwill we had built up over the course of the game, and because it
would have been a stylish ending, despite the fact that either of us
could have taken a solo at any time), the trust and ``what the heck"
attitude can exist to do a two-way DIAS without the carefully planned
expansion.

<p>
I don't think that would have happened here, Edi.  As Austria to my
Turkey, if we'd truly managed to succeed together to the extent
that we were both in the mid-high teens (which I doubt), I likely
would have found the temptation to stab you (as it is especially easy
for T to stab A in such alliances) to be too great.

<p>
(FRANCE INQUIRES): This was a demo game.  What did we demonstrate?

<p>
(EDI RESPONDS): That it was a fun game.
That writing press can be fun.
That the level of strategic and interpersonal relations/skills between players
is still the major challenge to players.

<p>
That the use of the phone as a means of communication still remains superior
to the typing of email and that much can be added to the game by picking up
the phone and talking to someone rather than lurking on an email line.

<p>
That there are still many levels of play in the game and that we each must
find that which gives us the most fun.  That those levels and areas of concern
are not the same in all players and cause considerable conflicts when players
try to translate them out into game rated performance.

<p>
Oh...and one last thing...don't let Hohn take Rumania.

<p>
(FRANCE [JOHN] COMMENTS): I don't see what makes the phone a superior 
means of communication over email.  It seems to me to be a matter of 
taste and style.  I am happy that I experienced phone communication in this game, 
but I still prefer email.
Perhaps I need to push myself some, but in this game I preferred to get off
the phone with as little transpiring as possible and move the discussion to
the written word.
Did we demonstrate that phone is better than email?  I don't think so.  I
think we demonstrated that they are very different and the medium does
matter in Diplomacy.

<p>
<p><br>
<center>ITALY'S ENDGAME STATEMENT</center><br>

<p>
Guess it's about time I put SOMETHING down on electronic paper about
this game.  Not that my role was anything to brag about - I never DID
get anything momentum going and wasn't able to play as much of a part in
the final outcome as I would have liked to have done.

<p>
The one big mistake I made this game was in being a bit taken by the
fact that it was a demonstration game.  I thought, and a few others
agreed with me, that it would be nice to do something unusual for a
change.  Edi's idea of a ``quadripartite" alliance appealed to my sense
of the bizarre.  Basically, I would attack France, Edi's Austria and
Mark's Russia would attack both Germany &amp; Turkey.  The attack on Germany
would be made in conjunction with Jamie's England.  Neat plan which
might have worked in theory except for two things:

<p>
1) Edi's negotiating style.  He flat out refused every single suggestion
that he should make ANY move that would commit him to ANY course of
action.  That gave the impression that he was going to play every side
of the fence no matter what happened.  That can only work for so long.

<p>
2) Mark's playing style.  Mark was very nervous about being in a demo
game and was especially concerned about being next to Edi (I had a touch
of that myself.  I have a great deal of respect for Edi's skills -
we've butted heads over a few games of FTF 2-player Escalation Dip).
This meant that he was hypersensitive to Edi's lack of commitment to
anything.  Mark liked the idea of the ``quadripartite" at first, but the
more Edi vascillated, the more nervous Mark got. This lead to our ``stab"
of Edi in 1902.

<p>
That ill fated stab (as well as the initial westward move in S'01) was
what led to me spinning my wheels for the whole game.  I ended up being
in a position of having to almost beg Mark or Jamie, depending on what
year it was, to let me get an extra centre or two to use against Edi,
Hohn or Edi/Hohn.  I was never able to gather up enough centres to be a
real factor militarily.  I spent the mid-game making no progress on any
front.

<p>
Once end-game rolled around, I ended up in the position that I feared
was coming for almost the whole game.  I had to find a way to make
myself become the vital third wheel in a stalemate line between France
and Turkey.  I did a pretty good job of that but, unfortunately, a
couple of things got in the way:

<p>
1) France's decision to let England back in the game.  (I never
understand things like that; if you take a small opponent right out of
the game, you never have to worry about him again).  That let a second
country vie for the position I was trying to achieve;

<p>
2) I faced a choice of letting Hohn go past the Italian peninsula and
taking a chance that he might win with 18 centres, or moving west
myself  and pretty much ensuring that Hohn would take my open centres.
I chose option #1 for two reasons.  First, if I remained on or near my
homeland, there was a chance that Hohn would leave some vital strategic
space open that I could slip into.  If he had held off on his final stab
ONE more season, I would have been in the Aegean and had some REAL
leverage.  (Didn't know that, did you, Hohn?  Heh heh).  Secondly, since
option two, in my opinion, GUARANTEED that I would eventually be taken
out, I figured it was better to cling to some faint hope that Hohn would
choose me over Jamie as being deserving of being in the draw.  I'm still
not sure why he chose to put me out of the draw, especially when he
did.  I can understand stabbing to at least TRY for the win, but France
seemed amenable to taking England out as the loser in the three way draw
sweepstakes and Hohn could have always stabbed LATER to try for the win
(there were obviously some background dealings of which I wasn't a party
to...)

<p>
I know that some (read ``most"  if not all) of you thought I was being
naive by supporting Hohn against the F/E/G alliance, especially in light
of the fact that it seemed inevitable I would get stabbed.  While I
think the above explains my logic, I also want to add that John's end
game statement shows that he was unaware of how close he was to taking a
real good shot at an 18 centre victory.  Hohn will, I believe, support
me on this.  France could have taken E/G out fairly quickly and, as long
as he did it one victim at a time, he could have been across the
stalemate line in Munich and St Pete's.  He would have only needed Jamie's
goodwill for a short time to achieve this.  Meanwhile, if *I* had gone
against Hohn, France could have even gotten himself in a position to
take Tunis and an Italian centre or two.  Only John's relatively
non-aggressive (for a Dip game) playing style, I think, prevented him
from seeing this.

<p>
To sum up, I may not have survived, but I believe I prevented a solo
winner.  I'll take solice in that during this cold Canadian winter
(sounds of violins, children shouting and the crack of a puck against
the boards in the background...)...

<p>
All in all, a very enjoyable game.  Certainly it was very challenging.
Most of the games I have played in the last dozen or so years have been
tainted by one or more players who's skill level didn't match the rest
of the board. That was certainly not the case in this game.

<p>
I expect to be at DipCon in Chapel Hill next summer.  If anybody here is
planning on attending, let's get together for a round of drinks and
recriminations, shall we?  :)

<p>
(EDI REPLIES): This technically and factually is incorrect.  
If you all would review the Quad
alliance proposals, I as Austria did exactly what I said I would do.  My
Spring, Fall and Winter 1901 builds were exactly what was called for.  In
Spring of 1902 I was stabbed by Russia as suspected and surprised by the
Italian stab.  From that point on I had every right to insist on a on board
demonstration of the intent of the Italians to pull back from me.  It
should be noted that in Spring 02 I moved into a perfect position to take
on the Turks if there had been a sign from the Italians of anything other
than a double cross.  Throughout the game's early period and carrying on
throughout the game Cal continued to give me false statements and to
perceive a strategic concept of things that did not facilitate trust,
therefore my response to him was that he had to `show me the truth' with
his moves, which he never did.

<p>
As for Mark, from my winter 1901 phone conversation with him I did not
trust him and felt that we was habitually committed to attacking me, again
combined with a perception of his game strategic view that did not
encourage trust.

<p>
Time and time again, as the communications probably show, I offered Cal
various deals which would have allowed for a check on Hohn and the
potential for something viable to develop between Cal and I, and time and
time again Italy moved against me.

<p>
I try different styles with different people based on what is going on in
the game.
Certainly my style with Hohn was far from lacking to make commitments.
What is missing in Cal's interesting summary is that there is a
relationship between the way people respond to you based on what is going
on in the game as that players properly employ a whole range of negotiating
styles at the higher intensity levels of play.

<p>
What would be interesting to carry on the 'demonstrating' side of things is
to go over the situation where you feel that the other player's negotiating
style is not what you want, then how to do you go about changing it and
seeing your own part in it.

<p>
For example from my perspective with Italy, he was unable to be trusted at
any time and that a single turns miscalculation on my part would have left
me decimated.  Going over the moves retrospectively I still can see any
turn after Spring 02 that I could have tactically trusted Italy and not
avoid a catastrophe.  In quite the opposite view there were numerous
postiions where Italy could have trusted in my actions without negative
consequences on his part in order to re-establish relations.  This tactical
interplay of trust is often overlooked and something that I strove again
and again with Italy to create but failed.  When the tactical consequences
are so overwhelmingly one sided there is no real basis for trust to be
re-established so it behooves the less threatened position to create a
tactical 'breathing time' for the negotiations to be redone.  Italy never
did this and my negotiating style with him reflected the fact that I could
never risk guessing wrong with him.

<p>
I would be interested in hearing from Cal on what move and what was he
expecting me to say that would have resulted in his halting the unending
attack on Austria that was his visible actions from Spring 1902?

<p>
(JAMIE COMMENTS): Hm, that was interesting.
I finally understand what Cal was thinking in the opening!

<p>
I couldn't figure it out. Tactically, it was completely incoherent. Italy
opens westward, the moves on the board go exactly as could be expected, and
then Italy immediately turns around and heads east. Since nothing unexpected
happened, why didn't he go east to begin with??

<p>
But of course, the explanation was entirely off the board. Cal was
hoping/expecting to hear a certain attitude from Edi, but heard quite the
opposite song.

<p>
I do not agree with Cal's remarks about the late midgame, though. It would
certainly not have been easy, as Cal says, for France to eliminate both
Germany and England by himself, even assuming Italy could have held off an
AustroTurkish alliance. And even if France *HAD* eliminated both me and
Pitt, he *still* would not have been able to win, I think. So personally I
think that was Cal's best chance, to control his own centers and Tunis while
keeping Hohn to the east and John to the west.

Jonas, John, Hank, and David are most definitely included

Speaking of reputations as the game ends seems quite
appropriate, don't you think?

<p>
(FRA-TUR): I am an enigma to you.
Do I care?
No.
I have not played well in this game, and if it were not for Germany,
I would have been eliminated long ago.
Because of that, I will support him in this game forever and will
never betray him.
If he decides to take my supply centers, I will not stop him, 
but will continue to hold out against you for as long as possible.
My goal is to see this game end as quickly as possible with a
three or four-way tie.
I am sick to death of playing this no-where game, and cannot understand
why you continue to waste all of our time by pursuing it further.
You may be an idiot.
I don't know.
Basically, I just don't care.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font

direction that I want them to go.
Or to have fun.
All my press from last turn actually happened, but of course
I changed the person's name that it happened to Richard's or
Yours.
For fun.
All were in the newspaper (or at least that is where the
Internet E-Mail said that is where the stories came from).
Prior to that I entered press, with the idea that it
might make Richard mad and then he'd do something stupid.
It's all part of the game.
<i>((That's for sure.))</i>
I thought that you were a figment of Richard's mind, not a 
real person.
For all I know you are, and Richard is laughing at me right now?
So far my press has worked, Austria will be no more in a few turns.
I didn't care if Austria stabbed Turkey or the other way around,
I just wanted one to die.
As a side note Austria deserved to die, he gave away his gains.
Do you think that if I keep writing insulting press to Richard
that he'll just give up?
OK, here goes!!!!!
Jim-Bob, contact Richard and ask him to vote for a F/G draw.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> BOOB): If I ever get to play with Barno I'll win
with my press alone.
By the way, I was just wondering if a) the builder had skipped 666,
or b) it bothered you?
I guess that the last laugh is on me.
I didn't notice it until I wrote the press.
They don't call me speedy for nothing.

<p>
(YNAMREG <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): I live at 1720 Quail Circle.
A year ago we got a wonderful new neighbor.
Mr. Jones should be sainted.

<p>
(YNAMREG II <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): I live at 1724 Quail Circle.
I've put a monument up to my new neighbor and anyone who 
doesn't like him is a !*!(/!)*.
(Edited by Jim-Bob for fear that Mr. Barno would be offended.)

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FG draw has been rejected and reproposed.
Please vote with your Spring orders.
As usual, failure to vote vetoes the proposal.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BERLIN to BOARD):  Do the math.  Approve the draw.

<p>
(RUSSIA-BERLIN): Yes-I did.
Just call me Tsardini.

<p>
(GERMANY to WHAT'S LEFT OF RUSSIA):  That's pretty big talk for a 
two-dot power.  
But if cussin' is all you've got left, then I guess you just cuss.

<p>
(TURKEY - ENGLAND): How pathetic that you ordered Army Livonia
to Prussia instead of ordering it to support Moscow.
So now you've lost Moscow.
No wonder you are being stabbed if this is your standard level of play.

<p>
(BERLIN to LONDON):  I thought there was no way in a million years 
that you would guess that I'd go to Prussia last turn.  
Congratulations on some fancy dancing.  
Unfortunately, the reason I wanted to go to Prussia was
to force Moscow, and, well, . . .

<p>
(TURKEY - RUSSIA): No doubt about it, France can win this game
with 18 SCs if that is his will.
(Hello there, Nietzsche, and I just used the word ``will''!)
He should have no trouble taking your last two dots in game year
1911, should also be able to pick up Austria's last dot,
start sacking England, and thus have the jump on Germany.
But he also may decide to wimp out and allow a 17-17.
His choice, his decision.

<p>
(BERLIN to PARIS): The only trouble with visiting Wales is that 
you have to spend a lot of money buying vowels.   
Do me a favor; drop by Denbigh and see if there's 
anything to mark Henry Stanley's birthplace.  I know
where he's buried - Pirbright, just outside London - but 
I wonder if the Welsh still claim him as a favorite son.

<p>
(RUSSIA-FRANCE/GERMANY): OK!
So, I'm leaving Con blank and I'm backing into the desert.
Leave me Ankara and I'll vote for the draw next time.
One more chance for you guys to stab each other.
