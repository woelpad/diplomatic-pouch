<br /><br />Yes, we're late again, I sm still in the hospital.
Logistically, it means Charlotte has to bring me my steenkin' maps to hand draw and then 
take them back home to scan. 
That also added a bit of time to the process and this map looks slightly different than usual. 
Health details are in the last word.
Let me know if you have problems or questions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website when I fix the new website index.html
at http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html, almost there.
At this point, I'm not wasting time figuring this out.
Eventually I will get one of the other new admins to help me, probably Mario Huys.
All the back issues are there in http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/TAPxxx.pdf or .html.
My poor html programming is making the move to diplomatic-pouch.com more problematic since I hardcoded
links in.  Sigh...
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i> is running down to a fold, mostly governed
by me, since I'm in the last game...  and Doug is NOT including TAP any more in ES, I am sending this out to
more people as a result.  Doug stopped in January, but didn't tell me he did that.  That means this E-Mail 
with this issue is going to more people in the style of Conrad von Metzke's WIMM list.  Since I'm just
"doing this" it may even be "coming out of the blue".  Let me know if you want the back issues since January
in ES sent to you (ES REALLY is running to a fold as soon as the last game I'm in there ends), and ON or OFF
this E-Mail list.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />I also am not going to hold this for full final TotalCon results, so that will be in next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i> in
<i>NSWG</i> #16, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  
Since Terry's passing, we lose our thirty year fervent hope that someday <i>NSWG</i>
would have been resurrected and I could go back and swear my fealty to the Toadfather.
The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines HERE and with the fold of Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> there are
some "rumblings" in that direction, we will see where they go. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more,
especially when I feel better.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.
Especially since after ES's fold-essentially that is NOW-we will be independent again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I also have a PDF that you can print of the entire szine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I'm having trouble with the new upload interfaces.  
I'll get it fixed as soon as I can.
I need to stay within the security of the site (which is very important!!!!)
while getting access to change the web site's index and files for the szine.
It shouldn't be that hard, but my first, second, and third attempts didn't work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />The general diplom.org/DiplomaticPouch website address is now:
http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />There are currently 77 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but I cannot
access it-so it as if lost to me.
I hope I also can make it
work again, but cannot right now.
YOU needed to make sure you're on this list, I'll let you know when I'm using it again.
I'll add some of the newer subscribers who aren't there when I do that. 
When this works,
there you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Please let me know about other issues, but it puts priority on getting the link up again.
Apologies for the recent confusions.

I'd love to do another game of Spy Diplomacy, but it requires commitment that seems in short supply.
Especially with Doug Kent bowing out who ran lots of variants, is there some other Variant in which there is 
interest for me to run?
Please ask!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
REGULAR DIPLOMACY: One game continues.
Is there something else we want to start?
Fred Wiedemeyer, Doug Kent, Mark Firth, Brad Wilson, are IN for the next one, only three to go.
I should be able to fill this for NEXT issue.  
It IS going to be random draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) So, some of you have been VERY disappointed at how fast the game goes with season 
separations the default.
Some of that was driven by being IN <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> which is now folding us free.
I want to go back to the TWO issues a month style I had for a big chunk of time before that
once I went to the web PDF from ACTUAL postal mailings.
Russ Rusnak used to be the one who would PUSH postal adjustments the most.
But with E-mail, I'm really not pushing. 
I am setting our Spring deadline in 17 days.
If I get even ONE complaint, I will push it back 14 more days to July 1.
To look ahead, I will then set SUMMER for July 1, and Fall for mid-July.
Private or open discussion and vetoing welcome.

Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.

<br /> <b>HINT to the Person with the Closest Geographic Guess:</b> In our modern era, this guess is about 
as balanced in "fame" as you could be to my identity; however, you have the WRONG gender!

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
I am adding a LOT of people to the E-Mail list for this szine, if there are back issues that you want to see, 
just ask me, and I'll send them to you.
The deciders are the current Diplomacy players, but I'm going to shrink down the deadlines for the szine to
twice a month.
This will still be where I am breaking things out by having ALL Winter and Summer deadlines will be separate, so
this really will be the same model as before.
If anyone else has comments on that, I'll certainly listen to them.
Also TAP #383 has my big health issues update. 
If you're seeing this issue, have not seen that one, and want to, just let me know!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also REALLY want to get the new regular Diplomacy game started, with my style of GMing and hand GMING.
The House Rules for those are at: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.diplomatic-pouch.com/Postal/Zines/TAP/houserul.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My aim really is just about everyone having fun, don't get too much caught up in what the house rules actually
say, though certainly ask about them if you like.
So, I have FOUR players signed up, ONLY three more to go and I want to start the new game in July!  If for whatever
reason, you would prefer to wait until the end of the summer with vacations and the like, I realize that is what may
happen.
Let's play in any case starting by September 1!
The Game Openings Announcement is up there a little higher and you can see what four players we currently have.
