<p><br><p><br>This is a big fat warehouse issue that would be even fatter if
I could get at the last two issues of <i>Octopus's Garden</i>
which I can't.  I will see Peter on Monday as he visits the
area, so we'll get it worked out and issues 42 and 43 of that
will appear next time..... wait, Peter got 42 fixed, so that 
is in here this time with the other subszines.
Check out 43 on the web page (see below) or wait until the
next <i>TAP</i>.  
[Finally done with this issue, pounded out in record time,
I hope I didn't make too many mistakes!! These are the last
words typed as Midnight and Thanksgiving approaches.
I hope you all had a GREAT Thanksgiving!!]
In the meantime, some other subszine announcements.
<i>Tinamou</i> and <i>Dead Poet's Society</i> are here, right on time!
<i>Tinamou</i> is going to join <i>DPS</i> on the web page.
I had to tell David we had one to get it there..... duh, does
anyone pay attention to the first page of this???
Am I whistling into the wind????
Ah, well, let's go on.
Next, the new stuff.....
I have volunteered subszine space to two additional people,
continuing to make <i>TAP</i> a massive bargain, but if they
both come on, I probably will finally raise the sub fees.
Heath Gardner is ready to do it, now!
His problem always has been the finances of publishing a szine.
I have decided to help him.
Also, the balance of having someone who is a Junior in High School
pubbing in the szine appeals to me STRONGLY.
Heath proposes to abandon his former games and start some new
ones, given that interest in reviving his previously orphaned
games did not exist.
This is the last chance for those players.
If you want Heath to restart your game, doing so is a condition
of entrance here. 
Write me, Heath, or both of us.
Heath will GM regular Diplomacy and It Came From Outer Space!
I believe??
Heath will have something official next time.
This came out of dialogue after he dropped the Colonia game.
Lastly, one of my szine mentors, Russ Rusnak is thinking about
guest GMing.  
He is of course welcome.
If any of his old friends would like to encourage him, do so.
That one is a little more uncertain at the moment, but I thought
I'd mention it.
There also are a number of people (Mark Kinney and Chris Trent
to name two) looking to start new postal
szines, so the hobby is NOT dead, it lives.
I ignore anyone who tries to argue this point with me.....
by the way, John Boardman continues to go strong, passing
issue #700 recently.
I'll never catch him, but might give him a run for it...
averaging 16 issues a year, I might get where he is in about
thirty years... but who knows how much longer he will go???

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE WILL BE JANUARY 16, 2000</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.
There will be options for new games from subszines though, stay tuned.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR MICHAEL HOPCROFT</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Michael has been found and the winner of the prize is Simon Billenness!!
See letters below.
I am not going to announce a new person until Issue #230.
Suggestions are always welcome.
There is a very special reason that I might need to search for
Brenton Ver Ploeg next..... I might need his special talents to
expose a new devastating hobby secret.
For those who can put two and two together, they may have be
able to figure out what that means.
For now, all I have are suspicions...... more juicy details to come,
but anyone who gets a jump from all that will be one up on everyone else.

<p>
In the meantime, let's get Kevin, Garret, Al, and ESPECIALLY
Jerry found too!!!
That is, as they say, a hint.
 
<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
Jim,
This is Michael Hopcroft. Simon Billenness sent me a note by e-mail 
telling me you were looking for me.
Right now I'm working for Goodwill Industries. My main fannish 
activities these days involve anime.
However, I have written an electronic book, <i>Weird Guy</i>, which is for 
sale at www.hyperbooks.com. It's a comic fantasy - ``The heart-rending 
saga of a man, a woman, and an exploding pig." I'm working on the 
sequel. I've also written a five-episode audio drama, but production has 
stalled as my time has gone away.
I'm curious to see how you guys in the hobby are doing. How has the 
Internet changed things?

<p>

<p>
<i>((Michael, well for one thing, TAP is on the Web now, check out:

<p>
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP

<p>
Simon wins the contest in finding you, although Mark Nelson
also said he'd spotted your name in the anime discussion 
groups.
Otherwise, the Internet has changed things a lot.  We're in the middle of
a worldwide E-Mail Diplomacy Tournament right now and Hasbro Interactive
is putting their stamp on a new Internet version of Diplomacy, due out
next year, so there is LOTS going on.  We seem to have lost a bit of the
real good fannishness of the hobby in the process, which is not as good.
If you want to look at some issues on the web and comment more that would
be great.  You also, by being found, are entitled to a free postal
subscription, what is your current postal address???  If you tell me
it is still the same Grand Ave. address.... well, let's just say that
I guess you were never really ``lost".))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Michael Hopcroft (Wed, 10 Nov 1999 12:56:06 -0800)</b>

<p>
What is replacing it, or dare I ask? I know people aren't publishing
postal zines as much, but in the right hands webzines can be quite fannish.
Or is the competition the really important thing now?
Hasbro Internet Diplomacy. Why does the thought sort of make me shiver a
bit? It seems like everything has to benefit a corporation these days for it
to be considered worthwhile. Preferably a gigantic, powerful one that
already has far more money and power than it knows what to do with. Any word
on when Hasbro will be releasing their first computer version of Dip? And
what sort of stuff will eb included with it?

<p>
PS: By the way, if you could encurage your readers to visit Hyperbooks
(www.hyperbooks.com) and consider buying my book I'd consider it helpful.

<p>
<i>((If you want to write me more detail about your publishing ventures,
I'll put it in the szine.  Mark Nelson didn't say what newsgroup
he spotted you in, but it must have been the last one you used,
whenever that was.  The Hasbro story is long and deep and still
being written.  All things considered it doesn't look truly awful,
but it could get that way.  My szine is still very fannish, but
it is extremely lonely out there.))</i>

Weird Guy is ``The Heart-Rending Saga of a Man, a Woman and an Exploding
Pig".  Arthur Random's life was fairly strange already when his new housemate
showed up - Hugo the Exploding Pig. Hugo is a bipedal, talking pig who
explodes every day.
    
<p>
Of course, there's more to it than that. Work, romance and daily life
are all the more complicated when your roommate blows up every day -
literally. The book is a small Acrobat file that only costs $4. Again, it's
available at www.hyperbooks.com.
I also recently published a webzine about sportsgames.

I am playing Austria for the <i>TAP</i> team and got placed in a game
with the infamous Toby Harris as Turkey.
My game has BY far the most web commentary (over 100 postings plus
additional discussion on the Usenet group rec.games.diplomacy).
Thus, I have declared a moratorium on me commenting on my own game.
I'm too busy playing it...... others are welcome to comment here too
though.
I'm not reading the web page notes any more.
Takes too much time.... since Chris Martin has been one of those really
active in commenting on my game, this is from the Press of the game I
am GMing, that Chris is playing in.....

A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what

toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.

they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?

<p>
Hi Jim-Boob,

<p>
Read the most recent <i>TAP</i> as well as some others that had stacked up but
which I had only flipped through, previously.  I noticed some babble from
Fred Davis about ``Silecia" possibly being the Polish spelling of ``Silesia"
or something.  Silesia in Polish is Slask (with a slash over the S and a
reverse cedilla under the A).  Shows what that wide-ruled paper shortage can
do to a person's mind.

<p>
In other news, I got a gold master of Hasbro's computer Diplomacy the other
day from Computer Gaming World so the game should be in stores in a couple
weeks at the most.  I'll be doing their review but it'll probably be in the
February issue (out in January) since my deadline isn't until after
Thanksgiving.  I could be wrong, though, as I don't know what their
turn-around is like.  (I've only done one review for them previously.)

<p>
Oh, and in response to a question you penned on an old issue from July, yes,
I was the KGO Zine Directory editor for one issue, back in May 1988.  I
recall because after reading your note this summer I mentioned it to Steve
Clark and he informed me that he still had a copy somewhere.  Next time I
saw him we found it and had a good laugh.  Comedic genius, truly.

<i>((Here is some of the latest comment from r.g.d on the new Computer
Diplomacy......))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Johnny Bravo (Wed, 17 Nov 1999 03:13:45 GMT)</b>

<p>
1)  Graphics - Fair, it would be nice to have a choice of units.  As
it is you have metallic looking ``stars" and ``anchors", mounted on
bases.  It seems a variation of the plastic pieces from the latest AH
release.  An option for the original wooden blocks would have been
great.  Even better would have been an open format so players could
use whatever pieces that suit them.  You have one zoom level that
shows about a quarter of the board, one intermediate level would have
been nice.

<p>
2)  Variations - The following are supported Standard, 1898, Shift
Left,  Shift Right, Fleet Rome, and Variants for 3-6 players.
6-player, Italy just holds, 5-player, Germany and Italy just hold.  4
players, it's combined powers (England vs Austria/France vs
Italy/Russia vs Turkey/Germany), for 3-players its
(England/Germany/Austria vs  Russia/Italy vs France/Turkey), each
combined power plays as a single country.  Gunboat is an option for
all variants but supposedly cripples the AI (it would be hard to tell
the effect of this, since the AI is lobotomized already). In short,
only variants you can play on the standard map are supported.

<p>
3)  Time Control - Each Phase has its own timer.  Defaults are 2
Negotiation Phases with 30 mins for the first one and 15 mins for all
others, with 5 mins to issue orders and another 5 to view them. The
summary phase is 5 mins long.  A pretty long default for an online
game.  The problem is that if you get someone who is losing, might
start using every second of the available time rather than quitting,
and each year ends up taking an hour to play.

<p>
4)  Interface - I don't know if it is just my system, but I meet the
requirements (P200 and 32MB RAM), but every time I click on a button
it takes about three seconds to get a response.  This makes the game
more work than fun.  It got worse as the game went on, around 1910 it
was taking more than a minute to order a couple of units as it took
over 10 seconds to process each click and many times the order just
wouldn't take so I'd have to repeat it.  Luckily for me the game was
over in 1911.

<p>
Gripes:
  
<p>
1)  Gunboat is useless, you cannot enter an order you can't perform,
so much for convoying your opponent to switzerland to indicate peace
offerings and such.  In this it fails badly, as the game specifically
allows you to make invalid (but legal) orders.

<p>
2)  AI is worse than expected, it is non-existant,  leaving centers
open, stranding units (Italy convoyed an army to Tunis and spent the
entire game moving it back and forth to North Africa).  I played one
game as England (with all AI set to high), in 1901 I took Brest, in
1902 I started a fight with Russia in the north, in 1904 I attacked
Germany as well.  The AI powers did not gain more than 2-3 centers
each the entire game, they just kept making the same bouncing moves
over and over.  I soloed in 1911, it could have been quicker but I
built too many fleets.  I never lost a center to enemy moves, even
when I deserved it.  I had one unsupported fleet in Brest, France kept
ordering Gascony-Brest and Burgundy-Munich, rather than Burgundy-Paris
and kicking me out of Brest the next season, France made these orders
for more than 4 game years without changing them.  Random legal moves
would have been more of a challenge.

<p>
3)  Negotiation with the AI - I never got to make any demands, the
AI would rush into the room, make a list of demands and if I didn't
start accepting them it would just leave within seconds, if I dealt
with the AI demands it would leave seconds later.  By the time I
looked at the map and decided exactly what I wanted from the AI, I was
standing in an empty room.   And for the AI completely unnecessary as
you can kill the best AI even if they are all against you.

<p>
3a)  Negotiation with the Players - There are 4 chat rooms and you
can only be in one of them at a time.  This makes it a bit cumbersome
to negotiate with 6 other people.  I think a better solution would be
everyone in the same room, you have a map, 6 buttons for the other
powers, you just click the power(s) you want to send to and type away.
This would speed things up as you can negotiate with everyone at once.
I think time is of serious consideration for online games, any
speedups would be very welcome, even if they aren't quite the same as
face to face play.

<p>
4) Display of turn results, it takes about 2 seconds to display each
move that was made during the turn and you have to sit there and watch
them play out one by one.  I wish I could set an option to display all
the moves on the map at once rather than wait for 60 seconds for the
same info.  This game is long enough as it is without needlessly
adding to the delays.  After 1902 I just stopped looking, just hit
next and went on to make my moves on the updated map, it was just too
much trouble trying to determine what moves the AI made.

<p>
Bottom Line - I'd rather play face to face or use the Judge, this
program fails in all the wrong places.  It looks pretty, that's the
only thing going  for it, there is no AI to speak of and multiplayer
just isn't up to Judge standards (no Judge support in the game).  To
run real time diplomacy, you would be 100% better off using  ICQ,
Realpolitik and a GM who would just upload a current picture of the
position to a web page for the players.  Save your money, this isn't
worth $40 just so you can play online at the zone in games that are
even more likely than the Judge to see massive dropouts, and the
quality of play will be much worse if those dropouts are replaced by
computer players.

<p><br><p><br><b>Keith Ammann (Wed, 17 Nov 1999 01:26:38 -0500)</b>

<p>
Well, I found it at a local store today.  NAB!

<p>
First thoughts:

<p>
The interface is pretty nice, but it takes a bit to get used to the iconic
negotiations, and a lot of the time the other diplomats will leave the
room before you can bang out a proposal!  (This gets easier with
practice.)  The graphics are gorgeous, and entering moves is fairly
intuitive.

<p>
At least on Low, the AI opponents don't work well together and tend to
fall into an ``I love everybody and won't go on a rampage - oh, but I'll
keep making opportunistic grabs at your supply centers" mode.  I'm hoping
for better from the Medium and High AIs.  Interestingly, even the Low AI
will act ``smarter" if you give it explicit recommendations on, say, how to
conduct an invasion (``Move this unit here, that one there, etc.").  Also,
one fairly significant bug:  The AI will occasionally ask for - and even
order - convoys by fleets in coastal provinces, which of course is
against the rules.  (It doesn't actually EXECUTE those convoys, but it
does order them.)

<p>
The computer players are better at defending themselves than they are at
attacking.  And they WILL make promises they don't intend to keep!
Sometimes they keep 'em, sometimes they don't.  Keeps you on your toes.

<p>
Biggest disappointment:  When I won the game against the Low AIs, I was
rewarded for my victory by ... a hung computer and a blank screen.  This
is a bug in dire need of fixing.

<p>
Can't wait to try network play!

<p><br><p><br><b>Bruce McIntyre (Wed, 17 Nov 1999 09:19:09 GMT)</b>

<p>
Bought it yesterday and have played with it for a bit.  I'll
update as I know more.

<p>
GOOD POINTS

<p>
The graphics and artwork are first-class.  There is an atmosphere
of the period kept up throughout, from the vintage flags to the
uniforms of the other players, to the opening graphics and short
interspersed pictures each new game year.  It FEELS like a hundred
years ago.  This is an accomplishment that has been missing from
other versions of the game-even the best written ``period" press
doesn't come close.  You can be a hard-core gamer and ignore it,
but don't knock it, it does add something to the game for the
people who will be introduced to it in this form.

<p>
The rulebook is essentially recreated in the game documentation
and I suspect in the tutorial, in a more easy to read format that
that of the sometimes-imposing rulebook.  Nowhere in the
documentation are there sentences like ``If a convoyed army attacks
a fleet which is supporting a fleet which is attacking one of the
convoying fleets, that support is not cut" (which I remember from
the 1971 rules, and which  has since been changed to something
even more complex for the newbie reading the rules of this
``simple" game for the first time).  Instead there is a detailed
look at each rule with examples, and a nicely written summary at
the end.

<p>
There are enough versions of the map to satisfy everyone, whether
you prefer to see elevation contours or political boundaries.

<p>
Entering orders graphically is actually quite easy once you get
the hang of it.  No serious problems on my P233.  It appears the
problem some people have experienced is that you have a rather
small space to click on for each unit to get an order started.

<p>
BAD POINTS

<p>
What Hasbro has done to facilitate Judge play has eluded me.  It
looks like they have concentrated on Gaming Zone play and e-mail
play, neither of which I have tried.  I'd have liked to see a
Judge Game Manager module included, but a couple of times through
the documentation seems to indicate that it ain't here.

<p>
What I have seen of the AI has two problems.  First, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to get the multiple clicks in the
right order to make a proposal to somebody in the negotiation
room, before they give up on you and leave in disgust, usually
adding that they are ``ready to proceed to the next stage", which
is the program's way of saying ``I tried to talk with him, but he
appears to be mute."  When you go into a room, the computer
players issue their proposals and wait for you to accept or
decline.  They usually give you about 30 seconds to look over 2-5
proposals.  By the time you've done so, you have maybe 5 left to
click three or four buttons to suggest a move.  Perhaps this gets
easier with time, but I haven't succeeded yet.

<p>
The second problem with the AI is that the computer player's moves
are awful.  I took France in my first game and in Fall 1901,
England was apparently so confused by my non-negotiation that he
ordered F Nth-Nwy, F Nrg-Nwy-no chance of Russia getting the
centre.  There's really no excuse for this whatever the AI level,
and anyhow I think I had it on high.  I hope that this is not what
happens if a friendly ally asks you to make both moves.  I'd
rather play with lapdogs.

<p>
There are 4 different map styles-would it be so hard to offer
different types of ways to represent units?  Blocks, Realpolitik
style squares, even circles and squares would be nice.  I don't
much mind the stars and anchors, but others do.

<p>
BY THE WAY:

<p>
I've been out of the Dip hobby for a while, just now getting
pummeled in my first Judge game, but what happened with the 1983
rule changes?  It seems that both the Judge software and the
Hasbro game have adopted the changes to XII 4. and XII 5.  XII 6,
the new rule requiring that the route taken by an army
experiencing an unwanted or unnecessary convoy be divined based on
the ``intent as shown by the totality of the orders written by the
player governing the army," seems to be part of the Judge (since
we have to specify routes for convoys) but discarded by Hasbro in
favour of the old rule that says nothing and assumes any convoy
order that fits the army move order to be through water.  On page
49 of the documentation there is a clear example that shows that
unwanted convoys are part of the Hasbro game.
<i>((There is a big argument starting up over this.....))</i>

<p>
Me, I'm an old-timer that hated 1983's new Rule 6 AND the flip in
Rule 4, and was not sure I liked the change in Rule 5 either.
(Yes, this is bait, and I have 10-year old postal zines to quote
from if you take it!)  I always suspected that the new rules in
1983 were forced upon Calhamer in order to let A-H create the
first Diplomacy commercial software without getting bogged down in
difficult positions, and I thought that they were unnecessary even
ten years ago when a 286 was a dream machine.

<p>
The real problem is that only one possible best set of orders is
generated.  Given an identical setup, the computer will make exactly
the same moves over and over.  Just for laughs I started a second game
and never issued any orders to my units the entire game.  I never lost
a center, and after 1908 no centers changed hands, the computer
quickly settled into a pattern of issuing identical bouncing orders
year after year.  The computer spent time negotiating with itself, but
I never saw anything come of it.  I terminated the experiment in 1917
as a 7 way draw.

<p>
I think that the AI built in to Hasbro's Diplomacy software
is-considering the complexity of the problem, a good start.  Yes,
it is still bad enough that anyone having played a dozen games
lifetime will have no trouble winning easily and probably quickly.
But that sort of judgment is based on the hopes of the Diplomacy
community that the software would provide a decent solitaire game,
one that, like Civilization for example, would be winnable but
would require some effort.  I think we need to get real here.  The
sort of people who would be able to produce AI as good as we want
have tenures at universities or real world jobs with salaries that
are not in Hasbro's budget for a game that is unlikely to ever
make the bestseller lists.

<p>
Now, for the interested newbie who has heard about Dip but never
played, winning will not be all that easy at first.  He'll have to
learn the tactics of the game before it gets easy.  In doing so,
he'll realize the limitations of the software and before too long
start looking for human opponents.  This has to be a long-term
good for the Diplomacy community.

<p>
But for the rest of us, we remain disappointed at this so called
AI that plays so badly we can usually win by 1908 or earlier.
Will Hasbro listen?  Unlikely if we concentrate on slamming them
and complaining about the price.

<p>
Actually, the AI, weak as it is, has one very good point.  The
Hasbro programmers have quantified the negotiational phase into a
scheme of proposals and attitudes.  I believe that their AI's
priorities in ordering units are far more based on offers than on
tactics.  A better AI might begin by having each computer player
review the attitudes seen and try to work out an initial order set
that will work best-then proceed with negotiation and compute
whether offers from other players that conflict with the initial
order set are reasonable or not.  Or perhaps each AI player should
come up with a list of possible order sets, discarding ones which
are obviously bad and see which is likely to be favourable to
allies.

<p>
For example, in the admittedly few games I've played, AI England
seems to take forever to capture Norway.  It opens to Nth and Nwg,
then attempts to move both fleets in for several turns, never
learning from its mistake.  This should never happen: any decent
AI will immediately see that this will lead to no builds and is
certainly non-tactical.  Fall 1901 order sets like A Yor-Edi, F
Nth-Nwy, F Nwg-Nwy should be labeled ``irrational" as quickly as
possible by the AI.  That the program persists in this tactic says
that the AI needs a better set of priorities.

<p>
But since the proposals and attitudes are finite, anyone with a
knack for AI can use Hasbro's scheme to create an AI of their own
within the Hasbro constraints.  Perhaps a group of us can work on
an improved AI, test it against the Hasbro AI, and when it wins as
often as we ``experts" do, we can ask Hasbro to incorporate it,
perhaps as a new AI level, in a future version.  Why not?

<p>
The Hasbro formula for proposals is this:

<p>
POWER [requests|asks|would like|demands|orders (depending on the
current attitude towards the power receiving the proposal) ] POWER
to...

<p>
...[DON'T] ATTACK POWER

<p>
...[DON'T] ATTACK PROVINCE

<p>
...[DON'T] ALLY WITH POWER

<p>
...MOVE UNIT to PROVINCE

<p>
...HOLD UNIT

<p>
...SUPPORT SOURCEPROVINCE DESTINATIONPROVINCE

<p>
...SUPPORT PROVINCE (holding)

<p>
...CONVOY SOURCEPROVINCE DESTINATIONPROVINCE with FLEETLOCATION

<p>
...BOUNCE (agree to a standoff in) PROVINCE with UNIT and UNIT

<p>
...NEUTRALZONE PROVINCE

<p>
Any complete proposal may also be phrased as ``hearsay," such as
HEARSAY ITALY CONVOY APULIA SMYRNA with EASTERNMED.

<p>
While perhaps not as complete as we might prefer, I think this is
a fine framework within which to create a decent Diplomacy AI.  I
suspect there are several people who could do a good job.  Go to
it!  Hasbro's a big company, no telling how they might reward you.

<p>
I have decided to take the plunge and try a pbm zine again.  I won't begin
publishing until after the holidays, in part because of that and in part
to see if this Y2K thing really is going to be a big deal.  At the moment,
I plan at least one basic Dip game, and possibly even one of the latest
version of John Armstrong's Global Diplomacy variant (for those
interested, the rules are on the web at 
http://www.armstronglab.com/globaldip.htm).  As yet I have no name, cost,
or other details available; I mainly want to see what interest there is
for the moment.  More than likely I'll do something similar to how I ran
<i>League of Nations</i>, with a major overhaul of the house rules.  Given the
last zine's eventual fate, I will not use that name again. :-)

<p>Now I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll find a commercial service to copy them for me.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.

<p>
To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
a free tape).
Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
That showed the value of getting in early!!
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson ($5),
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
Round 2 E-Mail voters got four chances and were Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch;
they got three chances to win.
Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee (2 votes left), and Andy York; they got two chances.
Round 5 voters were Mark Larzelere, Al Tabor, Jody McCullough, and that's it.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert

Kurt-THE CHURCH RULES!

<p>
Here's a report on the concert- we had to suffer through not one but two
opening bands before the Church came on. The Fenix Underground just did
that, I believe, to sell more drinks.  The first band, Black Atmosphere,
was death gothic glam rock, they were Grim Reaper wannabes complete with
weird makeup.  Their sound is like a poor man's Mission UK or Sisters of
Mercy.  They're a local band which I had bought their first album a
couple years ago based on a review I read, which was a big mistake and I
sold it- way too hard but their newer songs are more listenable and seem
to have mellowed a bit.  So ironically, I and poor Cathy were
inadvertently sucked in to see/hear them live anyway.  There was this guy
who looked like Mick Jagger who sang with the band on one song (and he
couldn't sing either).  Next up was Pilot, a six member ensemble also out
of Seattle, who started out good, kind of like REM (Cathy said the lead
singer looks like Bruce Willis), but the music went downhill after the
third song or so.  By this time our eardrums were getting trashed out,
although the sound system is very clear.  The Fenix is a very small club
and we were on the right balcony about 50 feet from the stage with a very
good view.  The Church came on stage at about 11:30 pm and let me tell
you, are they awesome!  Their sound was literally a wall of guitars. 
Kilbey, Wilson-Piper and Koppes were terrific.  I won't tell you what
songs they played right now because I don't want to spoil the surprise in
the event they play the same arrangement in Chicago as they did in
Seattle.  We can compare notes on which songs they played after you see
them.  I'll say this much, I was pleasantly surprised at the song they
opened with- it was unexpected and awesome.  All in all it was a great
show- I'm really glad we saw them as they are a totally cool band live-
no gimmicks, just great songs.  They played several of Cathy's and my
favorite songs.  The only downside of the show was they got too
self-indulgent during the encore, they played too long of a repetitive
jam (with the same chords over and over again played really fast for
several minutes until your eardrums burst) on the seond song in the first
encore, and the final (and unfortunately only) song in the second encore.
 This wasted time, when they could have played 3 shorter songs in each
encore instead.  They also didn't play Anaesthesia, which was a
disappointment- they could have easily made this one of the encore songs.
 Oh well, they did play two or three other good songs off the new album-
Steve Kilbey told the audience he wasn't sure if Hologram of Baal had
been released in the States yet, so that's probably why they didn't play
more than two- they focused mostly on songs from the albums Blurred
Crusade through Priest Aura, and nothing earlier than Blurred Crusade.  I
think they may have played one song from Heyday but you'll have to tell
me which one.  The Church played for 1 hour and 45 minutes, with the show
ending about 1:15 am.  I wonder if they would have played longer had it
not been so late.  We didn't get home until 2:30!  My eardrums have
recovered, but it took a few hours.  Rock n Roll keeps you young.  That
was our concert for 1998.  Let me know how the Chicago show goes and what
songs they play over there.  Thanks for the tip, Kurt, that the Church
was coming to Seattle- it was well worth seeing them live and especially
in such a small club (which was packed, by the way, we had to give up our
stools and stand near the front railing of the balcony so our view would
not get obstructed by others).  Ten years ago (during the Starfish tour)
I bet they probably played in a much larger hall and it wouldn't have
been as intimate.  And $16 per ticket was a bargain.  Gues what- there
will be new R.E.M. and Midnight Oil albums coming out this fall, sometime
later in October.

<p>
One, you mentioned ``Family Business" as ``one of" your favorite card 
games.  As someone always looking for the next new fun thing to play at 
housecons and with friends/kids I will be getting this in the near future.  
I don't believe it's made it into this particular West Coast crowd.
<i>((Really??
I learned it in the back alley with Linda Courtemanche (don't ask!!)
and it is very popular in all of the various East Coast and Midwest groups.
You probably don't have enough mobsters on the west coast.))</i>
  
<p>
However, this game is also only ``one of."  What, pray tell, are the others?  
I'd say ``Mama Mia" a pizza making game is one of the lighter games we've 
been playing recently.  No one liked Pokemon when I brought that in.  Magic 
is gone.  Hockey we don't play anymore.  ``Off with their heads" is fun.
<i>((Mama Mia was the other one I was thinking of when I said that,
but you were the one who taught me that!

Chris Trent wrote eloquently about Oakland sports and of starting a new

joining the Corps to spread the hobby even a tad more - maybe a major leap 
more.  HASBRO deserves quite a thank you as well for realizing what we've

Beware music annuals - Counting Crows has come out with a new CD.  I 
shall let you know next issue if even two months of release will put it into 
my top 10 listened to for the year.  Which will be easier this year, because 
my music was boxed for so long.  And a big PS, BBKing is playing in a 
not-too-big venue, the historic Paramount Theater in Oakland 11/22.  I'll be 
in the first row of the mezzanine.  First time I saw him was in Mobile, in a 
small movie theater in a typically poor part of town, about the 8th row, on 
the aisle.  That was his first tour with Bobbie Blue Bland.  Bobbie has 
gotten older and more snorty while BB has stayed the same and I enjoy his 
music even more.
   
<p>
and finally, you put in a word for World DipCon in Baltimore in August, 
2000.  I have it penciled in my day planner.  Would it be that we all did.
<i>((Yeah, I'm really going this time and I'm going to play the

My World Masters Tournament game is going well enough as Austria.  This

impatiently for the Fall 1903 results.
<i>((No comment, enough of that elsewhere.))</i>

<p>
I also GM a game and that is clicking along finally.
Most of the games I've reviewed have F/G taking out England, typically by 
A-PIC-WAL, and some combination of others taking on/out Turkey.  Maybe I'm 
glad I didn't take one of the big, corner powers.  Others perspectives - 
since I've not reviewed a representative sample.
<i>((The scoring system, in my opinion, stinks.
And once everyone gets the hang of what it is, and starts playing to it,
there will be lots of other complaints.
I hate scoring systems which put LOTS of weight on center counts.
This mandates cutthroat tactical play at the expense of alliance strategic
play.
Our game was playing the scoring system from 1901, since one of the designers
is in my game.....))</i>

<p>
As I've heard it told in my television production classes, the electronic
television (there were earlier versions) was invented by a potato farmer
in Idaho.
His brother created the vacuum tubes according to a recent episode of 
``Sports Night''.
He came up with the idea of a ``scanned image'' while plowing his field.
This concept is responsible for all random image display screens we use.
More important is that RCA and General Electric essentially - and for
the most part legally - stole his idea.
He later appeared on an old 20 Questions style game show where a panel
of judges tried to guess a person's secret.
They couldn't guess that he was the inventor of the electronic television
and he won the prize - $20 and a pack of Winston cigarettes.
In the end this was all he ever received for his idea that revolutionized
human communications.
<i>((Yes, that was the story I'd heard parts of and was struggling to
remember as John was telling me the Logie-Baird story.
I believe the program was ``I've Got A Secret'', at least that was the
story I heard in Schenectady, NY, where I grew up and where the GE
engineers took the idea and designed electronic televisions 
for the first time.))</i>

<p>
For the Internet, I can't find any reference to a particular person, but
according to <i>The Internet for Dummies</i>, the Internet is a combination
of IP (Internet Protocol) and dynamic routing.
Both were brainchilds (or brainchildren?) of the US Dept. of Defense.
<i>((Well, sort of, there IS a gigantic debate about how all this got
started.
As I remember at the time (being VERY loosely connected to people who
used the initial Internet and going to high school with people who 
hacked into it regularly), the connection between the Universities
and the DOD facilities and how the whole thing worked was much more 
controlled by the universities, right from the beginning.... and
DOD seldom innovates, they just grab onto technology created by others;
but let me let you go on, you do talk about some of this....))</i>
IP, the ``language'' all computers speak on the Internet, lets traffic
from one computer network flow onto another (thus the need for a universal
language).
<i>((And right from the beginning there were different operating systems
to be linked - at that time, I recall the main difference being between
IBM computers and Sperry Univac computers.
Later in the decade, the most commone difference was between DEC 
and IBM operating systems.))</i>

<p>
This was used when the DOD created ARPANET to connect its military research
facilities.
ARPANET became wildly popular with Universities and so ARPANET's military
sites were separated into MILNET.
IP was created so that people could move from the non-military ARPANET
to the MILNET.
<i>((Again, that's not really how I remember it in 1972 or so when I
first became aware of MILNET/ARPANET.
IP was talked about then as the way to get IBM computers to talk to 
other kinds of computers.
The military/university distinction was not crucial for this, I don't
think.))</i>
Another important aspect of IP is that each workstation (the predecessor
of the PC) speaks the language, eliminating the huge supercomputer servers.
This created the Internet's fantastic ability to let individual computers
talk with each other, instead of just with a central computer.
Dynamic routing is another concept used in Internet addressing.
It lets information find any route from its source to its destination
instead of being forced along assigned routes.
DOD created this so that it would be difficult to knock out the networks
by enemy attack.
This was proven when the Allied forces had a hard time eliminating Iraq's
command networks because they were using commercially available routers.

<p>
<i>((Well, perhaps.
This issue is partly a matter of dispute as well.
What dynamic routing REALLY does, is split all Internet information into
little packets, so any one message itself can be split up and go in 
different directions to get to the destination, where it is reassembled
into a whole.
If you think about it, having a part of the network go down while a part
of the message is going that way MAY mean the entire message never reaches
its destination (though parts of it might).
I believe that is the way (rare, but it happens) most E-Mail gets ``lost''.
The magic of the Internet is the way this process spreads the load of 
messages across the entire network and prevents bottlenecks.
Even though no one at the time contemplated the idea of ``E-Mail
attachments'' (which are really huge and tie up lots of bandwidth
at times), this prevented people who were sending large messages 
from tying up whole segments of the network.
There are also some neat aspects of the priority systems that, designed
early, held up well in the exponential growth periods of later decades,
but I won't bore people with such nitty gritty....  looking at maps
of the architecture of the Internet from the 1970's through.... well,
the last one I saw was for the Northeast US in about 1990 or so,
I'm not sure if anyone bothers to produce them any more; but
looking at the maps illustrated the growth really well.))</i>

<p>
Eventually, ARPANET couldn't handle any more traffic, so the National
Science Foundation created NSFNET, offering researchers the service
of using several supercomputers over the Internet.
The supercomputers turned out to be a bust but the NSFNET continued
as an Internet server.
Meanwhile, private network servers were connected to the Internet
by various companies like IBM and Sprint and eventually serviers
were built commercially for the sole purpose of providing access
to the Internet.
<i>((Initially, these connections were done via ``Gateways"
that sometimes you had to specify precisely when sending E-Mail.
Things are a lot easier since what we think of as the ``Internet
domain number/name" system was fully implemented in.... what was
that, 1989 or so?
That was the step that made the World Wide Web possible and killed
much of a need to carry maps around that told you where Gateways
were....))</i>

<p>
Thus, if you must have labels, the Internet was invented by the
US DOD, but in reality, it doesn't exist.
It's just the newfound ability for people to move from one network
to another.
The Internet is a sort of living thing that has grown on its own.
As a matter of fact, I recently read a book (but can't remember
the damn title!) that took place entirely in the form of e-mails
between an intelligent Internet program and its creator.
Scary.

<p>
How Al Gore figures himself into all of this is anybody's guess.
<i>((Weakly, admittedly, but he claims to be an early advocate
in Congress of adding money to develop ARPANET into the Internet.
I don't think anyone takes that especially seriously, even him.))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I am open to suggestions on the latter, though I want to print maps and
***I*** don't know how to make the rings rotate easily.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this very soon.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

2) Conrad, please stop whining about not giving out enough 
Boardman numbers and give us one, please???

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GM to FATHER DAN): At one point I commented to you that I didn't have
your orders and you sent me another set.  I just wanted to make a
public apology.
I did have your orders, but since the two sets were the same, I did not
have a problem.
I state this just because Buddy had a similar fate strike him in another
game and his GM handled his error very badly.
I want Buddy and the rest of you to know that if I make an error, I will
do everything I can to correct it as quickly as possible and with the
least damage to YOU, my players.

<p>
(ITALY to RUSSIA):  Trust me!  This will work!
 
<p>
(THE POPE'S PARLOR): Scantily clad nuns run giggling from the room as the
Pope allows his War Cardinal College lay out the maps and wooden blocks on
the really big table.
``So," he growled, ``dis important?"

<p>
(ITALY to AUSTRIA): Trust me!  This won't hurt!

<p>
(TURKEY to ALL): To a good game, everyone! Good Luck!

<p>
(ITALY to GERMANY): Trust me!  This isn't what it appears!
<i>((Yes, Kathy.... or Don.... or Jim-Bob..... anyone here read my
comments on r.g.d about Italy?
I thought not.
Never mind....))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE): Let's find out what happens.

<p>
(ITALY to FRANCE): Trust me!  I am the only one you can!

<p>
(LONDON, MAR 21, 1901): The Ambassador to France has been recalled in protest
over the lack of effort on the part of France to come to an agreement over the
lack of effort on the part of France to come to an agreement over the English
Channel.
Prime Minister John Beale rose in Parliament to say ``Three times our Ambassador
presented our proposal to the French government and each time our proposal went
unanswered.
This rebuff is as good as an insult and cannot be tolerated."
The leader of his majesty's loyal opposition asked why the Prime Minister had
not declared war.
The Prime Minister replied that the government saw no reason for such drastic 
action.

<p>
(ITALY to TURKEY): Trust me!  This is what was foretold!

<p>
(SOFIA, BULGARIA): Leaving the cheers and flower throwing crowds behind them in 
Constantinople, the Turkish first division marched into the capital of 
Bulgaria today. The army encountered little resistance from this small Balkan 
nation though a few soldiers were lost to sniper fire. The Turkish navy 
appears to be headed west, following the first division's path while the 
Ottoman Empire's second division moved to Ankara to guard against any 
possible Russian incursions. The Sultan has sought to quell the rumors of a 
crumbling Ottoman Empire by expanding Westward. Praise Allah! Death to any 
infidel who dares stand in our way!

<p>
(ITALY to ENGLAND): Trust me!  My blade isn't long enough!

<p>
(ANKARA to ROME): Lepanto is a poor choice for an empire wishing rapid 
expansion.

<p>
(ITALY to GM):  So there!
<i>((OK, so is it a Lepanto or not..... I don't think so!!!))</i>

<p>
(PORTSMOUTH, APR 1, 1901): The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, Samuel
Oen Barfer (S.O.B.) finished his drink, ``Well, bottoms up and down
the hatch, hey wot!''
Shortly afterward, First Sea Lord Barfer was escorted aboard HMCS Kipper
(the Royal Navy's newest vessel).
As the Kipper put to sea, Barfer glanced out a porthole and was startled
to observe the surface of the sea rise past it.
``By God, Captain Hood, we're in over our heads.''
``Aye sir, we are proceeding on a submarine voyage.''

<p>
(ANKARA to MOSCOW): As you can see, I, too, can play with honor despite being a 
bit of a nervous type.

<p>
(SMYRNA to GM): This could be interesting.

<p>
(WHITEHALL, APR 13, 1901): The conference of the Sea Lords began.
``Gentlemen, what is our duty?" asked First Sea Lord Barfer.
``Our duty, sir, is to protect the seas around our island.
If the dastardly French think they can do as they please they are sadly
mistaken,'' replied Sir Edward Seaward, Second Sea Lord.
``Hear, hear!''
``Bravo!'' chimed the rest of the Lords.

<p>
(CONSTANTINOPLE to VIENNA): Stay in touch. 

<p>
(Levkovychi, A Small Village South of Kiev, Ukraine, Formerly White Russia, 
Circa 1800:  Potato Eyes and Bean Strings Press): Mother Russia has received 
so many conflicting messages that she now lies in state in the outer offices 
of her shrink.  She was heard muttering:  ``England is convoying to Norway"!  
``England is not convoying to Norway"!  ``Turkey is moving into the Black Sea"! 
``Turkey is not moving into the Black Sea"!  Her son, the Tzar, and her lover 
[same Tzar] rushed into the room exclaiming, ``Mother, they all said that they 
never lie and that they always tell the truth.  So, if they lied when they 
said they always tell the truth then they always lie.  And, if they always 
lie, then when they say they never lie they mean they always lie.  I think 
that is the truth!"  Mother Russia got up and ran into the Ladies Room.

<p>
(VIENNA): Within the Chamber of Deputies a strange stillness fell. For rising
to speak was an old and feared man of the people, who spoke thus:

<p>
Again I say I rise for Austria, and its peoples.
	
<p>
The man who fears war and squats opposing
	
<p>
My words for stour, hath no blood of crimson
	
<p>
But is fit only to rot in womanish peace
	
<p>
Far from where worth's won and the swords clash
	
<p>
For the death of such sluts I go rejoicing;
	
<p>
Yea, I fill the air with my music.
	
<p>
Peoples, Peoples, to the music!
	
<p>
There's no sound like to swords swords opposing,
	
<p>
No cry like the battle's rejoicing
	
<p>
When our elbows and swords drip the crimson.
	
<p>
May God damn for ever all who cry ``Peace!"
	
<p>
And let the music of the swords make them crimson!
	
<p>
Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!
	
<p>
Hell blot the thought ``Peace!"

<p>
 The stillness continued as he sat down, 
and none other dared to speak.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that John Power has changed his E-Mail address.

<p>
2) Somehow the French build in Quebec ended up in Montreal, a province
that isn't even on our map.... that has been corrected and presumably
didn't fool anyone.

<p>
3) I am shooting for a NO MISTAKE adjudication this time..... can I do it???
No retreats, it is a press only Summer season coming up, so you have plenty
of time to correct me, but I would really like to get the hang of this map.
I think you are all about to clash in ways that will challenge me further
;-)

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(CHINA-OTTOMAN): I've reached my western extent at Nepal. We need to talk.

<p>
(CHINA-PORTUGAL): Note the above.

<p>
(SPAIN - OTTOMAN): Sorry the letter was late, hope you got it in time.

<p>
(PORT to SP/FR): Get the French out of Iberia!

<p>
(SPAIN - NETHERLANDS): Sent a couple of emails, did you get them?

<p>
(TOULON): Admiral Dartagne is quiet pleased with the state of the French navy.
We know have four strong fleets to defend our native soil, and to further
our colonization efforts. Lets see if I can break historic tradition and be
the first French ruler to have a decent navy.

<p>
(CHINA-RUSSIA): I thought that you didn't have a problem with borders. At
least not when you and your Austrian ally we're asking for Korea and
Manchuria.

<p>
(MONTREAL): French trappers and explorers are doing well in Neuveaux France.
The Great Marcel Marceau Wilderness is just across the LaSalle River and
hopefully soon a grand city will be founded in the name of the King. St.
Nicolas sounds like a good name for a city along the banks of the LaSalle
River. (As if I would name it after that pompous King Louis).

<p>
(PONTIAC): It is reported that some neanderthal looking Portuguese are making
their way eastward from the Yukon. Hopefully they will have the sense to
avoid interfering with French objectives in Neuveaux France. Our native
allies, the Mohicans and Huron don't take kindly to anyone messing with us.
The Mohicans Nathaniel, Chingachgook, and Uncas will be on my side in this
one, since the anglais haven't arrived in the new world (yet?).

<p>
(SPAIN to WORLD): If anyone has any comments on the map Jim is using
please let me know as I'd like to continue improving it.  So far
I've noticed that the Siam/Malay border is rather confusing, and
the center dot on NWG is hard to see, as is the one in Ifni.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note John Schultz' new address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ITALY - INDIANA ST. PRISON SYSTEM):  Are you still reading this far into 
the szine?
<i>((I'm not so how anyone else possibly could be is beyond me.
We ***KNOW*** Don Williams is not reading this far, so we can call
him a good for nothing liar (translation: a Diplomacy Player) with
impunity!!
Warning, read the press in this game at your own risk.....
Let me start with something nice before.... well, you read it.))</i>

<p>
(SARA to WORLD): My thanks to all who wrote or phoned after the 7.1 earthquake
struck southern California.
The apartment building I live in swayed back and forth and back and forth
for about two minutes, but no real damage was done.
The cats, however, were thoroughly spooked.
Had to bribe them with tuna to get them out of their hiding places.
This time we lucked out, as the epicenter was way out in the middle 
of the desert.
Next time?

<p>
(NEW-CZAR to TSARINAS):  Blow me, babies.  Blow me, up, up and away!

<p>
(DR. LAURA to BOOB): Considerations of good taste make it desirable
to use a prop (a banana) instead of the human anatomy to demonstrate
the proper use of a condom.

<p>
(JODY - SARAH): You deserve a double dose this time for what you have 
done.
<i>((Sic, sic, sic....))</i>

<p>
(DOCTOR RICHARD WEISS <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> DOCTOR LAURA): I have nothing to say,
and I am only going to say it just once.

<p>
(SANDY - JOHN): When the spring rains come on little cat feet, the mighty 
winds of feminism will reveal the vast chasm of obliteration perpetrated 
upon you by your gender peers.

<p>
(JODY to DR. LAURA): My previous message was meant as a wry comment on the
way people's attitudes change as their circumstances change. It sounds like
you HALF got the joke. BTW, I'm a guy.
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork, and yes, you are..... I will attest to it.))</i>

<p>
(DR. R. WEISS - DR. LAURA): I appreciate your NLP approach.  Is that 
``Nuking the Leaders Plan?"

<p>
(ITALY):
Italy would like to note that it is not building this time, no builds are 
needed, and that is rather pissy from the others in this game.  I mean 
``pissy" in both the modern colloquial and the 50's, ``don't eat the yellow 
snow, the Russians have been rather pissy with their nuclear testing" sort 
of meaning.  If y'all thunderheads notice, I'm only one above ``neutrals" in 
this game.   If yah wahnt to be pissy, go pissy on the neutrals.  And, don't 
forget, we change countries each time, so next time I'm Russia, Sara isn't.  
But, since Sara and I are both doing so poorly, maybe cross-gender confusion 
and cross-country domination confusion would not hurt me.  Don't bomb Russia 
next time.  Let me put that in a way which will more likely enter into your 
sumbliminal perceptions and influence your conscious and your cretin 
subconciousnesses DONT BOMB RUSSIA!  And one more time, this is YOUR MOTHER 
speaking, ``Don't bomb that poor little starving fellow in Russia."  Forget 
Chechnya.  Love the Russians.  Nuking Russian SC's is not ``sharing your 
toys,"  Love, Mom.

<p>
(WAS ENGLAND to WAS RUSSIA): ``Anxietyship"??

<p>
(POPE-MIKE):  Quit complaining about no fun moves, no wondrous paths of 
black holes to traverse.  At least you have something to move.  All mine got 
chopped off after the bombings.  I don't get to put em in anywhere anymore.  
No movement.  No wondrous black holes to traverse.  No life.  Little 
conversation or press.  So, meditate today on the relative abundance and 
goodness of your life.  As Baba Rum Raisin said, ``Stop and smell the black 
holes."

<p>
(BOOB to POPE or CZAR or WHOEVER YOU ARE): Smell the black holes, sure,
but be sure you know how many black holes you can create!!
You seem to be producing more than your quota.

<p>
(CZAR WHITE to BOOB): You earned that name for a reason.  
I keep ordering 5 nukes from Russia 
because I am sure that you will eventually forget and let me fire 5.  Put that 
in the press as f/u to your comment.

<p>
(BOOB to CZAR WHITE): And you are lucky that I have more decorum than to 
sink into your hog wallow.....

<p>
(RUSSIA to ENGLAND): Why should we have to fight
over your home dots? Italy and I are in perfect
agreement, and France doesn't seem interested.
You're no better off than me now. Maybe you
should rethink your strategy?

<p>
(ENGLAND to WORLD): Ouch.

<p>
(AUSTRIAN PRESS RELEASE [api]): Ambassador Pollard has remanded 
himself to the tower of solitude of the 
courtyards within the Embassy of Vienna, where he has not been seen for 
months.
Aides were reported to hear his Excellency mutter, ``Zis iz noht goot,  Zis iz 
noht goot at ahll. . . . . . . . . . . "
Due to the treacherous Italians, the nation is now in a flurry of 
reorganization to commit its full efforts and resources to winning this great 
World War.
 
<p>
(ENGLAND to WORLD): I really mean it.  Ouch.

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE): Don't believe the wild rumors about conspiracies
involving Mike Barno's hair.  The Ancient Arcane Order of Barbers
refutes all such stories, calling them propaganda instigated by the
Illuminated Mystic Hairstylists' Guild.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note Kurt Ozog's new new E-Mail address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GM to THE SO GOOD THAT ***I*** AM HURTING): Hey, what moves were these???
It looks like everyone had a deal with everyone.... well almost....
it didn't look like anyone had a deal WITH Steve, only deals ABOUT
Steve, well, and I guess Russia bounced a lot too.  But these other
moves..... well, no more commentary from me.  An interesting Fall 
season coming up, I'd say.
I say all this with the hurting ignorance of the GM.

<p>
(PAUL to KURT): Are you going to stick with this email address for a
while?

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): I know you probably want us to put you out of your
misery, but it won't be long now.

<p>
(FROM PARI- er, I mean MADRID): I've lost track of my copy of the last
zine, so I'll have to be general about my messages, but you know who you
are.  The original French player should still be around, so feel free to
go ahead and chide him.  Yes, this is something of a Hermit reunion;
always a fun thing.  And finally, next time I'm in a hopeless position,
I'll be sure to get your help, you.  (all that seems really odd put into
one sentence.  So what, eh?)

<p>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA): Hello?

<p>
(ENGLAND to TURKEY): Is that nasty fleet Ionian heading your way or mine?  If
I didn't have F WES, I bet you would be looking at F EAS.  Hold on for
awhile longer.

<p>
(LONDON to ROME): Don't worry about anything.  I'll stay on my side of the
Med and move right out once I root out France.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB, PART I): Death.  Taxes.  The curse.

<p>
(JAMES to WORLD): No, no, no! It can't by true!  Syracuse University loses to
Rutgers!  If you lose to the worst team in Div I football, what does that
make you?  Forget football, bring on the hoops!
<i>((How about going back to baseball some more instead???))</i>

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB, PART II): Ok, I said I wouldn't comment on the baseball season
anymore, but this is Diplomacy, isn't it?  Besides, I have new data.  The 10
November Indianapolis Star Sports Section had a chart that gives the
payrolls of all 30 MLB teams.  The 8 playoff teams for this year were all in
the top 10 in payroll.  The only exceptions were the Dodgers (#4) and the
Orioles (#5).  The Yankees were #1, and the Braves were #3.  The Yankees had
a payroll of $90.9M, and the Marlins had a payroll of $14.6M.

<p>
And Bud Selig STILL hasn't called me to fix things.

<p>
(BIEHL to EMMERT): I noticed your 
comment to James in <i>TAP</i> 225 about the best football players being in the 
NFL and only second best players being out of organized football. You 
mention arena football but you fail to take account of the CFL (an older 
league than the NFL) nor NFL Europe. Admittedly the NFL has 95% of the 
best football players but they don't have all of them. Witness Kurt 
Warner from NFL Europe and Doug Flutie from a six year stint in the CFL. 
Let us not forget the incomparable Warren Moon and his five (count em 
five) consecutive Grey Cups with the Edmonton Eskimoes before the NFL 
would start a black quarterback. There are players moving from the CFL to 
the NFL (and vice versa) every year. Also, as a little known bit of 
football trivia there have been seven CFL-NFL exhibition games. These 
were played in the early 60's. The American teams won six of these 
meetings, a Canadian team only once (unfortunately I do not recollect the 
exact match-ups). It is also unfortunate that the CFL expansion into the 
United States failed as the Canadian game is an exciting game. Look what 
the Baltimore Stallions were able to accomplish in just two years of 
existence (they are now the old Montreal Alouettes franchise of the CFL). 
Anyway, what a surprising NFL season this year with all last year's 
front runners struggling (except Jacksonville) and some new teams doing 
exceptionally well (like my old time personal favorite the Rams).

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) David Partridge, 
John Schultz, Tom Howell, Harry Andruschak,
Eric Brosius, and John Harrington will be in the new game here.
I have orders from all of you.
Running late getting the szine out, so this game will get started next time.
First moves will be due in the first issue in 2000.
Then the new game will begin just about the same time as this one ends.
We'll be playing Version 2.3 of the rules as published a few issues back.

<p>
2) Note John Schultz' address change.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(STOOGES): The Stooges' Team Doctor announced that he is in the market for
some new steroids.  The current batch seems to work very well,
but has no staying power.
<i>((Damn, can't you read the name of the game here?
If you tell me this, I'm going to have to have your riders killed....))</i>

<p>
(Goz Transportation Co., quarterly report to the parent company, Goz &amp; Co.,
Inc):  Profits off $1M this quarter, somewhat better than expected.  The
CEO's 7-year-old niece has proved to be a better prognosticator than any of
her predecessors, and has been given a raise in her allowance and 2 packs of
Pokemon cards.  The call has gone out to all divisions to make as many
acquisitions as possible before filing for Chapter 11 reorganization.

<p>
(CHEF - KIDS): Light the afterburners!  Time to make the final
sprint!  Remember to stay in formation.  

<p>
(VEGAS - NEWTON): For staying with Meg and Jason, your check is in the
mail.  The Goz Corporation is quite irate.  

<p>
(DATELINE LA): The baseball season is over for the Dodgers and the Angels.
They had the kind of season that makes us Angelenos really excited about
our professional football team.
And we DO feel sorry for Pete Rose, banned from baseball for gambling.
He should have done what the rest of the players do and stuck with
alcohol, drugs, and prostitutes.

<p>
(CHEF - ALL RIDERS): You are all cordially invited to the victory
party
at the South Park City Hall.  The Mayor will make a pointless speech,
and we will all feast merrily to celebrate the victory of the
South Park Cows in the bike race.  I will personally prepare the
main dish on the barbecue:  harsenpfeffer!

<p>
(``WELL, DUH!'' DEPARTMENT): My usually reliable sources have privately
informed me that some people are upset at Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura
because, as published in the recent issue of <i>Playboy</i> magazine, he made 
what they regard as... are you ready for this?... several outrageous statements.
Meanwhile, Pat Buchanan has left the Republican Party for the Reform Party,
which should raise the intelligence level of both groups.

<p>
(PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PAT BUCHANAN - WORLD): I am calling for an
immediate boycott of Taco Bell.
Their use of Mexican chihuahuas is taking jobs away from poor, hard working
American dogs.

<p>
(CHEF - MCGREGOR): I figured you would try to get Flopsy a big
card so I dropped Stan back to join in.  Good job wrapping up
the 2nd and 3rd spots.

<p>
(DR. SHACK ye QUACK-BOOB): ``ERAT ABHINE VIGINTI ANNIS HODIE, CENTURIO
PIPER CATERVAM CANERE DOCEBAT."  Translation: It was 20 years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play.

<p>
(STAN - MOPSY): Move over, Rover.  Let Stan Marsh take over!

<p>
(TEMPERANCE PREACHER #1): If I had all the beer in the world, I'd 
take it and throw it into the river!

<p>
(CHEF - SALLY STRUTHERS):  Time to start singing!
(I know, that's mean, but, really, is she going to read TAP?)

<p>
(TEMPERANCE PREACHER #2): If I had all the whiskey in the world, I'd 
take it and throw it into the river!

<p>
(CHEF - BOOB): Why did you have that long letter from Harry Andruschak
published in this game?  
<i>(('Cause that's where he asked me to put it.
Guest press always is allowed in ANY game.
I presume it is because he is fixin' to get into the next bike
race in this slot as soon as you guys clear the track....
he's back this time, obviously....))</i>

<p>
(TEMPERANCE PREACHER #3): If I had all the wine in the world, I'd 
take it and throw it into the river!

<p>
(CHEF - HARRY): We won't serve any dog or cat at the celebration party.
But perhaps some tasty barbecued rabbit!  :)

<p>
(TEMPERANCE PREACHER #4): Let us now all stand and sing hymn #234,
``We Shall Gather At The River.''

<p>
(GOZ COMMENTS ON THE UPCOMING ENDGAME): Based on the way I read the tea
leaves and the tie-breakers, it looks like the bunnies will make a huge
sprint for the finish and come up just short.  I see them getting 2nd, 3rd
and 4th, but Chef, besides his 1st, will get 5th and 7th to win 49-46.  GTCo
salvages 6th and 8th to get enough points to tie Brit Pack for 4th overall,
behind the Stooges and ahead of TFWS.  Sheesh!  Ya tie the game designer and
still wind up in the dust.

<p>
TFWS-DAMON: My gift to you: a six.
Never say I gave you nothin', ol' bud.

(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``You'll all have known the feeling
that sometimes makes you sad... lying all day all night only knowing
the feel of skin or sheets never opening the shutters to the sunlight.''
From the liner notes off of <i>Fear and Whiskey.</i>

<p>
(BRITAIN-WORLD): My apologies to those who didn't hear from me.
Unexpected move.
See my COA and trust I'll answer next time.

<p>
(SPAIN-WORLD): Ok, I've been thinking that when all you die is that only Heath 
Gardner is (This is his last name, right?) on the standby list for Modern 
Diplomacy. As long as it's not then I'll win.  Though we could go for a dual 
monarchy.
<i>((Uhhh, right.... there are five people on the Modern standby list,
Sean, am I missing something??))</i>

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to THE LESSER BEINGS IN SPAIN):  Get your asses out of
Auv, and feed on somebody lower on the food chain.  It will do wonders for your
bowel movements.

<p>
(ROME-BERLIN): Eat worms, Lesser German Reich!

<p>
(UKR - GERMANY): Congratulations, it's my guess that you just held your
own with the entire world against you.  Not a bad showing!
<i>((Just about right....))</i>

<p>
(UKR - GM): I sure hope the whole world was against him, or I'm probably
in trouble!
<i>((To all practical purpose.... there were small exceptions.))</i>

<p>
(ROME-LONDON): There is still time to renounce Darkness and choose the path
to The Light, my son. 

<p>
(UKRAINE - ENGLAND): Hi John.  You signed up for the snowball game in
Tinamou, but I never got orders.  You're still there if you want to 
play.  Sorry I didn't write myself, but things have been far too busy
lately.
<i>((Sometimes there is an advantage to staying quiet at the
beginning..... glad we found you again.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Russian concession is rejected again.
A BHJFT draw and a BHRJ draw are proposed.
One of the reasons that this particular variant annoys me is
that the draw proposal names are so ugly......
Anyway, vote with your next set of orders, if you do not vote,
they cannot pass.

<p>
2) Note Kurt Ozog's new E-Mail address!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(H - J): I don't understand why you joined this game.  If you want to 
play a game where you don't communicate with anybody, I suggest
Gunboat.  I can accept that you join the game and ruin all the
plans I made with Luke.  I can even accept that you feel the need
to make pointless attacks South.  I cannot accept a complete
refusal to communicate.   You have yet to acknowledge my existence,
even after being in the game for a couple months now.  If you don't
have the time to play this game properly, don't volunteer to standby.
 
<p>
(H - M): Let's get Luke back.
<i>((Feel free to go try to track him down.))</i>

<p>
(H - R): Pop quiz.  Which of us can get more fleets to Arabia more
quickly?

<p>
(TURKEY to all regarding draws, concessions and garage sales):  SUFFAHHHHHH
BITCH!!!!  (Turkish for ``At this time we are not able to support any
situations that are not favorable to the peaceful peoples of Turkey")
 
<p>
(H - F): Hi Roland.  Remember, it's business, not personal.

<p>
(H - M): Reading about ``Doc Boob" and ``Boob Doc" reminds me of a doll
I saw advertised here in Germany called ``Baby Doc".   No joke.
Probably not a big seller in Haiti.  

<p>
(RANDOM DUTCH SPORTS RANT):  Pudge Rodriguez as MVP??  Baseball
writers need to stop taking themselves so seriously.  This choice
is so bad it devalues the award.  
<i>((You do know that BOTH Texas beat writers voted Pudge 4th (I
think
it was, or perhaps even lower!).  One of the guys who left Pedro
off their ballot is conveniently on vacation and unavailable for 
two weeks..... a coincidence? No way!!  The other has been on 
talk show after talk show after talk show.  I've heard him a couple
of times now.  He is waffling quite a bit, saying that he talked 
around to people and thought that MANY more people said they 
weren't going to vote for Martinez, but when the voting came out
he was shocked that there were just two.  Anyway, the implication
was that lots of other people agreed with him but were unwilling
to vote their conscience, largely because the vote is public.
It should be secret!))</i>
Or...they could have an explicit policy about who to vote for.  
The way things stand, the criteria are totally undefined, so we don`t
know what it it supposed to be for.  

<p>
I'm not upset merely because Pedro lost - I expected that.  
I expected Manny Ramirez or Derek Jeter to win.  They both had much
better seasons than Ivan Rodriguez did.  It's pretty pathetic to
give the award to somebody who only had 6 first place votes.
