<br /><br />The szine is late again, I am having job issues that could necessitate other such
delays in the near future.
I pushed deadlines to account for this, and will keep doing that as necessary.
JOIN the 23 TUNES GAME!!!  SEND ME THREE TUNES AND COMMENTARY!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
I will also be submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.
That's it, not complicated.
I think I have three lists so far, I'd like to play with between 5 and 10 of you,
so let's get started!!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
We have another exciting issue of <i>By the Way</i> in this issue if everything
is going as planned.
We're making progress on starting new games, help fill things up, see below for more.
The new regular Diplomacy game has started, Spring 1901 results in this issue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARGARET GEMIGNANI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, now, why Margaret?  Margaret, of course, is one of the most famous personalities in 
Dipdom, Science Fiction, Star Trek, Comic, etc. fandom.  
She was a nurse in the DC area, I believe, and then retired to Florida some years ago.
Many people had an address for her in Fort Lauderdale (including me), but that address
went missing around 1994.
If you do Google searching, as I have done off and on, there is a Margaret Gemignani
that contributes to the Baltimore and Ohio Historical Railroad Association, along with 
a husband, Gino (anyone know if that matches.... the B&amp;O matches where she used to live...
but don't tell me, use it as info to go looking yourself!!!)
Margaret has a couple of mentions in the Diplomacy AtoZ and I first encountered her
in the old Bernie Oaklyn <i>Le Front</i> szine.
I think it would be fun to find her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jeff, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jeff Key or Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Hi Jim,
Just wanted to let you know that I did a quick check of area phone books 
looking for Derek Nelson.  I called the only one listed, but it was not the

See http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Semifinals have now begun.  
Some semifinal notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.
Actually, in an update, the Semifinal games will begin in Mid-September.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen anything on progress in these games,
and that's why.
But the pairings have just been announced.
More on that next issue!!!
Thomas Franke and David Partridge are in a game together that seems
on first glance to be the weakest in the rest of the players.
So my first thought is that one of those two will have a slot in
the finals.
I am getting raked over the coals for it, but I just ended a game
in a three way draw between me, Thomas, and Ray Setzer that I might
have had a chance in ekeing out a win mostly because Thomas asked
for it to end so he could focus on this semi-final.
Sorry, David, but I had to do it.....

It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
But most of the talk that there has been has about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson
and Tony Dickinson, among others!).  
This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really
is quite comprehensive.

I'm not sure what is going to happen now, but basically everywhere 
except in Russia the game pretty much failed.
The AI was not good (not a huge surprise) and it just required too many
updates to get it to work.
Besides, it really was designed for "real time" play and everyone
doesn't want that.

Just happened to notice the remarks about your brother playing in a game that 
you're GMing.  (See? I DO look through the zine now and then!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, since there's no deception 
involved.  I've run games and fantasy sports leagues in which my wife, brother, and 
cousin have played for many years, and I've never even had a complaint of 
favoritism.  (Not even in 1999, when my wife Krissi had a perfect season and was 
the #1 team in all of Gonzo Football!)  Really, a relative is no different in 
this respect than a close friend, and many of us in the postal gaming 
community have plenty of friends playing in our games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wouldn't hesitate to join one of your games which also included your 
relatives.  Just my two cents worth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Edi Birsan (9/27/06)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually there are several reasons that Lepanto is correctly named...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1. The Battle was a Victory of Italy over Turkey

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2. The battle featured the triumph of Italian/Western mechanics-skill over
the Turks

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3. The central feature of the battle was a rather straightforward
destruction of the Turks nearly head on

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4. The battle broke the Turkish control over the eastern seas (though it was
technically not fought in the Eastern Medit as defined on a Diplomacy map it
was considered as being in the Eastern seas at the time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5. and most important it was fought on same month and day as my birthday
thus being doubly appropriate!
So there take that....

I noted with interest your notes on the "Key Opening" which brought back  
memories of a game where that very set of moves was used against me (I was  
Turkey) by Dave Grabar (playing Italy, what else) and Rich Shatto playing Austria. 
It worked very well against me and even Russia (I forget who was playing 
Russia) jumped in on the Turkey dinner and I was out by year 03 or 04,  I 
forget exactly.  This was a ftf game we played well over 30 years ago, in  
Chowchilla, CA.  Never knew that back stabbing move had a name.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I want to pick up the music commentary again and run a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
You send me 23 tunes and five or six lines of commentary on each.  I print them
with comments from me 2-3 at a time and then YOU have to guess who submitted each
set of tunes for that issue.  I give "bonus points" for quality and subtract points
for really lame selections.
Mark, forget how the scoring goes, one point for each person you guess right each issue,
correct?
To enter, you can send them 2-3 at a time, or you can send me the whole list of 23 tunes.
But I think we should be able to get at least ten people playing.
I have an advance commitment from Brad Wilson to be in, so this should be FUN.
When we're done, whoever wins I'll try to figure out how to make a CD of tunes from
the list for them.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.

What We Should Learn From the Failure of the Bush Presidency
by Ig Lew</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's an ambitious title. For almost a year now I've had it in mind to write 
an article that lives up to it. There's a lot that's wrong with the Bush 
presidency, but I've been frustrated by the shallow analysis by many Bush critics 
(mostly Democrats, but not entirely) that boils the whole thing down to, "Bush 
is bad, so we should replace him with someone good." There's an important 
article to be written rebutting that view.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What follows is not that article. Realistically, I'm never going to get 
around to writing it. I did, however respond to a post in RMO one rare day when I 
had some free time, and some of the related ideas came out. After about five 
paragraphs I realized RMO wasn't the place for it, so instead of posting, I 
saved it for Benzene instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The context isn't important. One of RMO's resident liberals mentioned that 
she's looking forward to the end of Bush's presidential term, and along the way 
referred to that as "a change in regime". 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Regime change doesn't solve the problem. The Bush presidency has been 
damaging to the country not because Bush is incompetent (we've had incompetent 
presidents before), nor because he's evil or malicious (which I don't believe he 
is), nor even because he has political goals that you or I disagree with (we've 
had plenty of that before, too).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've survived plenty of bad presidencies before. The reason this one 
threatens to do lasting damage is because of structural damage to our political 
system. The United States has a long record of social, economic, and military 
success in large part due to our excellent form of government. Crucial to that 
success is the various correcting mechanisms built into the system. In addition to 
the celebrated checks and balances between our three branches of government, 
there is the balance that comes from reconciling the two sides in our 
two-party system. Most important of all there is the matter of accountability, 
ultimately to the electorate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I would add one comment to that excellence where it has failed, and that
is where one of the parties itself fails or needs to be reborn and I think
that's where the Democratic party is.
I actually think we need a new party that is fiscally conservative and
socially liberal, and this actually would oppose the current Republicans
who are on the opposite side of both of those.
The Republicans have figured out that they can be big spenders if they
can write lots of contracts.
Eventually, we may figure out how to better write government contracts,
and there is lots of innovation going on in this area - including the
relatively new concept of "Business Associate" agreements that set up
rules and responsibilities before you even get to bid on a contract - 
but far too much of the contracting is itself extremely inefficient
and ineffective.
This happens in different ways from the inefficiency/ineffectiveness
in traditional government services, but it really does happen and is
not the panacea Republicans would have us believe.
Another big issue is the failure of trade unionism.
Watch Andy Stern, who is the head of the Service Union and trying to recreate
that institution.
People who I know and really respect that know Stern personally say really
wonderful things about him.
And what is happening to the economy in this country?
It is more and more a service economy.
So the populism we need as the alternative to the government contract
oriented Republicanism is a true respect for diversity, that lets
the best ideas bubble up, not be dictated down.
And that will be socially liberal and fiscally conservative.
I would also note, as a liberal Christian in a fundamentally
religious country (using fundamental in its other sense), that
this is most definitely NOT a give-back to secular humanism.
Our other serious problem in this country is the dramatic
decline in ethics (and if you believe the information on this,
this cuts across liberal religious, conservative religious, and
secular humanists at the individual level) and that also to me is
a problem with top-down ethics and ethics by Directive that this
administration also is trying to foster.
Ethics start with people and communities too.
And we ain't got it right now AND even more worrying, it is getting
MUCH worse in my view.
The best evidence to me is the complete reversal of the "traffic driving
courtesy" that was so wonderful right after September 11th and is completely
in the toilet now.
He who would be first, shall be last is still a powerful and not fully
embraced dictum.
Watch Andy Stern....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All of these are now severely damaged, in many cases deliberately damaged by 
the Bush regime. Power is dangerously concentrated in the executive branch 
now. Current lack of congressional oversight is unprecedented in our history. 
Even when Congress is inclined to participate in government it is crippled by 
lack of good information. The executive branch controls information, and it 
manipulates policymaking by selectively withholding it, distorting it, or in some 
cases even fabricating it. The judicial branch is similarly shut out, with any 
court that disagrees with executive power branded as "activist". Legislation 
is increasingly ineffective, as the executive department declines to enforce 
laws it doesn't like and fails to implement congressionally mandated government 
initiatives. Recently, the executive repertoire has expanded to redefining 
Congress's laws to mean something other than what Congress explicitly intended.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, I see a lot of this first hand. 
One of the reasons this szine is late again this time is that I'm leaving my
current job (where it is just too untenable to me to be told "not to think
about that, because we don't want anyone to know the answer" from the more usual
"tell me the answer, but I might make decisions politically that ignore that"
which has always been the case in government) to get a bit more freedom of thought
in a related but different job.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Partisan power has become dangerously unbalanced as well. Traditions and 
procedures in American government had evolved so that a certain amount of 
bipartisan support was necessary for major decisions. The corrosion of rules in 
Congress began before 2000, but it has grown considerably worse during the Bush 
presidency. Everything we learned in high school civics class about how laws are 
made is obsolete now. Sometimes members of Congress aren't even given an 
opportunity to read the laws they vote on, much less participate in writing them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Worst of all is the loss of accountability. The greatest strength of our 
political system was the way in which successful policy would drive out 
unsuccessful policy. With the political equivalent of Adam Smith's "invisible hand", 
those policies and their implementors who succeeded in providing the electorate 
what it wanted would be rewarded while those that failed would not. In a 
healthy administration, the same dynamic occurs within the government as well. When 
a department's program is successful, it is emulated. When a department fails, 
the person responsible is sacked and someone else is given a chance. Even if 
it isn't that person's "fault" per se, it's still part of the process that 
assures that good ideas rise to the top.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What worries me about Bush's detractors is the naive belief that simply 
removing Bush will solve these problems — that Bush fails simply because he's a bad 
president and if we replace him with a good president, all will be well. It 
won't. Without repair of our political system, the next president — whether 
Democrat or Republican — will be just as ineffective.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think that is sadly, precisely the point.
In my view, it is all about control and power.
In any organization, and this is a very old idea, you don't promote innovation
unless you find good people and free them up to come up with new ideas and 
things.
But if you try to rule through Directive, as this administration does, you 
rely an awful lot on the small number of people writing directives for 
"good ideas and things", plus no one has really figured out how to convince
people to follow most kinds of Directives on issues that really matter.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For all our squabbling about hot-button ideological issues, there really 
isn't that much distance between what Democrats and Republicans want. We all want 
economic prosperity, protection from terrorism, disengagement from Iraq 
without the Middle East exploding into a messy war, etc. The disagreement is about 
the best strategy for achieving these goals. Of course these are all difficult 
questions. If they weren't, there wouldn't be the heated debates. We're all 
just taking our best guesses, and no one really knows the answers. If someone 
did know — and again, this is the genius of our (now damaged) political system 
— that answer would be embraced. If someone stumbled on a plan that really 
did, say, bring peace to the Middle East, we wouldn't continue to bicker about 
it. We would say, "Hey, that really works; by all means let's do it." At worst, 
each party would grab the idea and claim it as its own, but either way it 
would get done.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bush's detractors seem to think that he fails simply because he's dumb and 
has the wrong ideas and we just need to put in someone else who's smart and has 
the right ideas. Of course, Bush doesn't know all the answers. No one does. 
Our system of government does not require the president to have all the answers, 
and that's exactly why America has proved more successful in almost every way 
than totalitarian states like the Soviet Union.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The reason Bush has failed so spectactularly is that he has destroyed the 
mechanisms whereby good ideas rise to the top. There is no accountability 
anywhere in the administration, all dissenting views are vigorously squelched, and 
all information is kept as confidential as possible. The result is that when 
someone is about to do something stupid — as will inevitably happen — there is 
nothing there to correct the error, either before or after the fact. If some 
piece of our government policy is terribly misguided, there might well be a 
whole lot of people out there who would recognize the problem, but they probably 
don't get a chance to see what's going on, or if they do see it they aren't 
listened to. Once the bad policy is in place, it stays in place — possibly 
because the ill effects are kept hidden, but even after a department head 
accumulates a six-year record of bad results, he's still allowed to continue, because 
this administration values loyalty over competence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes and no, actually in my experience the patience actually is much less now
but it is about failure to appear (and appear is the key word) loyal in some
relevant way.... including bad political publicity.
So the key is not whether or not you GET bad results, but whether or not it
becomes generally known that you had bad results.
This was the problem with "Brownie" for example in Emergency Management of 
Katrina.
I thought it was interesting that the "big complaint" against him was that quote
about when he knew about people trapped at the Superdome "today" when he said
that because he hadn't been to sleep for three days and to him three days ago 
WAS today.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When thinking about who to elect as president in 2008, voters — both Democrat 
and Republican — who are appalled by the breathtaking failure of the Bush 
presidency should not be thinking about which candidate, or which party, has the 
right policies and the right ideas. What we need to be considering is which 
candidate (or party) is committed to repairing a political system which brings 
good policies to the top regardless of who suggested them. Given that the 
damage to the system was done primarily as a means of pursuing power, both to the 
party and to the executive, undoing the damage is going to require a president 
willing to let go of a lot of power. What we emphatically do not need is an 
anti-Bush whose attitude is, "The other guys had their chance to do whatever 
they want without restraint; now it's our turn."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((In academic speak, those of us who talk about this, discuss the need to 
embrace the Third Generation of Knowledge Management (where Bush and his people
are stuck early in the First Generation) where you recognize that some problems
(like Iraq) are inherently complex and need to be approached that way and not
simplified, some problems are complicated but can be simplified, and other problems
really are inherently simple; and context and communities of people are all that
really counts in determining how to solve them.
Thanks, Mark.
I hope I answered your question below.))</i>

<i>((Hey Mark, do you mind if I print your review of the political situation

pretty well in synch most of the time.  I agree that the REAL problem
is that bubbling up innovation in information economy issues being

I assume you're talking about the same one Brux just forwarded to his 
mass-email group, right?  The one titled "what we should learn about 
the Bush presidency", or something like that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That would be fine. I'm very interested in what you'd have to say about 
the general idea of the free market metaphor as it applies to 
decision-making within a bureaucracy.  There was some of that in John 
Kay's recent book (I forget the title, but you probably know it: 
something very Adam Smith-like), and I found it very inspiring.  But 
rereading my article lately, I didn't really pursue that as much as I 
would have liked.
<i>((I'm not sure I know precisely that book, but the idea these days
is that people are picking up is Adam Smith's ideas of moral sentiments,
which is partly influencing me in what I said above as well.  A book you
might really like to pick up is Daniel Goleman's book on "Social Intelligence",
I've not read it yet, but I intend to do so soon.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think the accountability of bureaucrats within the system is the 
larger problem than general accountability of office-holders to the 
electorate, but it reads like I'm emphasizing the latter more.  Maybe 
I'll follow up on that in the context of the "Richard Clarke was/wasn't 
fired" debate.

first requires accountability of the bureaucrats who write contracts and
oversee them.))</i>

Today's game is: given team X, X not the Yankees, how many of the starters for team X 
would be starting for the Yankees?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the Red Sox, I thought at the beginning of the season the answer 
was three (the obvious two plus Varitek) but after Varitek's weak season 
I think it might be down to two.  
<i>((Possibly, but I would argue from the "look what happened when Jason missed
a month" perspective to say that Varitek is still a winner doing what really is
important for a catcher: managing the game on the field and calling the pitches.
He really wasn't all that much weaker at the plate than he's ever been if you
break it down either.))</i>
This is one of the reasons I got very 
annoyed at people who were filling out the days of September by trashing 
Manny Ramirez.  One guy at a Sox blog said 
"he does this every season", after which I pointed out that 
Manny had played 150+ games in each of 2003, 2004, and 2005.
So, in case it's not obvious, the Sox starters would be Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For a reference, let's look at the Yankees lineup:
Damon CF,
Jeter SS,
Abreu RF,
Sheffield 1B,
Giambi DH,
ARod 3B,
Matsui LF,
Posada C,
Cano 2B.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There was an amusing bit on ESPN's page 2 yesterday that did this analysis 
for the Tigers, and picked the Tiger at eacch position.  :)  
More seriously, I think from the Tigers I would definitely start Pudge 
over Posada, and I would get Magglio into the lineup somehow.  
<i>((Pudge is the same way.
Pudge and Manager of the Century Jim Leyland are willing the Tigers to the top.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Twins:
Castillo 2B,
Punto 3B,
Mauer C,
Cuddyer RF,
Morneau 1B,
Hunter CF,
R White LF,
Nevin DH,
Bartlett SS.
Morneau and Mauer are definite starters.  I'd also take Hunter over 
Damon and Cuddyer over Abreu.  Not bad here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The As - I started to list the lineup and then it became obvious that Frank Thomas 
would be the only one I'd play.
Ugly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL - 
Cardinals:
Eckstein SS,
Duncan LF,
Taguchi LF,
Pujols 1B,
Edmonds CF,
Rolen 3B,
Encarnacion RF,
Belliard 2B,
Molina C.
It's harder to make this comparison because of the DH discrepancy.  
Pujols would obviously 
start.  Other possibles would be Rolen, Duncan, and Edmonds.  
Edmonds is getting a bit slow with the bat, but he's definitely 
the better fielder than Damon.  Duncan v. Matsui is pretty close.  
Let's go with Duncan because Matsui was hurt most of the season.  
And I'd definitely want to have Rolen at 3B - the question would be 
what to do with ARod?  I would use ARod as the DH in an AL park and 
in the NL park I'd stick him in the outfield or something.   
So I'd take Pujols, Duncan, and Rolen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Padres:
Piazza's not the hitter he used to be, but Posada never was that hitter.  
I'd take Piazza and that's about it, though I'd want Mike Cameron around 
to sub in for Damon for defense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dodgers: 
Russell Martin, Nomar, and Jeff Kent are the candidates.  
Martin might become a better hitter than Posada some day, but not yet.  
Jeff Kent is on the downside of his career and Cano is better now.  
That leaves Nomar.  Nomar doesn't have quite enough hitting to be a top-flight 1B, 
but then Sheffield is not exactly playing in position either.  
I cannot see Nomar dislodging either ARod from 3B or Jeter from SS, 
but I'd want to get his bat in the lineup somehow.  So let's again 
say 1 player and that's it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets:
going with
Lo Duca C,
Delgado 1B,
Valentin 2B,
Reyes SS,
Wright 3B,
Floyd LF,
Beltran CF,
Green LF.
Beltran is in - no brainer.  Lo Duca?  Almost.  Delgado - yeah, I'd start him over 
Sheffield. Floyd? Nope. Green? Nope.
Wright or Valentin?  No way.  That leaves Reyes - an interesting  problem.  
Reyes vs. Jeter would make for an interesting debate.  
I suspect Reyes is the better fielder and, although he doesn't quite 
hit as well as Jeter, he is a great base stealer.  
I think I'd find a way to bump Cano and play Reyes.  
Or DH Jeter, play Giambi at 1B and bump Sheffield.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So that makes 3 Mets, 1 Padre, 1 Dodger, 3 Cardinals, 3 Twins and 1 Athletic.  
I should get back to work...

And now the Red Sox can hibernate until next Spring.
<i>((But this will be an EXCITING off-season.  I think things will happen now
and we will really see a new team next year.  Sometimes you have to lose
to make the big changes.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm going to jump on the Twins bandwagon.  I remember about the middle 
of the season saying that the Twins would be a nasty opponent in the 
playoffs if they somehow made it in, and since I'm basically stuck 
going with the Yankees, Mets, or Twins, I'll go with the Twins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Looking at the various series:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees v. Tigers:
Well, it was a nice season for the Tigers, but it ends now.  
If you want a justification, compare the relative second-half records.  
The Yankees are still a bit short on pitching, but their hitting is monstrous.  
The Tigers have good pitching, but they've been a beat-up-on-weaklings 
team all season.  Yankees in four. 
<i>((Yeah, the Yankees will overpower them, Yankees in four sounds about right.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's v. Twins:
Twins have Santana.  A's counter with Zito, who's not been nearly as 
good for quite some time.  Twins also somehow have hitting with Mauer, 
Cuddeyer, and Morneau.  A's are hot but Twins are hotter.  Twins in four. 
<i>((In my opinion, this is the series for the Champion.  I think the A's will 
win this, really!  Yes, J-B being contrary again, but I feel it in my 
bones and have been thinking the A's would win it all for some weeks now.
This series will go to the limit, and Frank Thomas is hugely hot, and he
will win the series in the last game for the A's.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cardinals v. Padres: Well, the Wells trade worked out for the Padres.  
The Cardinals have been disappointing for the past month, and their 
pitching has never really come together.  I tend to ignore the NL, 
but I've had Pujols and Duncan on my fantasy team this season.  
If those two and Rolen are hitting, the Cardinals definitely have 
the better lineup.  But they still don't have enough pitching.  
I'll go with San Diego in five.
<i>((I like Duncan too, and he was on MY fantasy team (we think alike!).  But
the Padres will win this.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets v. Dodgers: Wow, there are a lot of ex-Red Sox in the playoffs!  
Too bad for Pedro that he's going to miss the postseason, and too 
bad for the Mets, too.  If Pedro were healthy, this would be an easy pick.  
I'm still going to go with the Mets, but it could take four or five.  
Let's say five.  
<i>((And the Dodgers will win this.  The Mets are going to have a lot of 
trouble.  Steve Trachsel has to have a great start for them to win,
and he won't.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, it's time for coffee.  Final pick is Twins over Mets in World Series.

lose to the A's or Twins.  I don't think the Yankees have a chance with
their pitching to get to the Series.  I think you flip a coin here too,
but I'd go with the Dodgers, I think.  He who laughs last, laughs best.

The Tigers are stumbling.  The Yankees are pretty smooth.  Yankees in 3.
The A's have been doing it with mirrors.  The Twins have been doing it with 
mirrors and pitching.  Twins in 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wells still looks like he should have a keg behind him on the mound.  Cards 
are too inconsistent, and not just their pitching.  Padres in 5.
Look it up:  the Mets are 11-12 in games that Martinez started this year. 
They're actually BETTER with him out.  Mets in 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Subway Series part II.  Same result as part I.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And on a local note, the Cubs have been hibernating since mid-April.  The 
White Sox showed just how hard it is to win when you're actually supposed to 
win.  They will be angry in 2007.

Well, my picks were real good weren't they?  My only correct pick was the

would fall, too.  0/4 is more interesting than 1/4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, since I already picked the Mets for the WS, I'll stick with that. 
The Cardinals compensated for their thin staff by using Carpenter twice.  If 
they can somehow get Carpenter two starts against the Mets, they'll have a 
chance.  They also have a chance if somebody other than Pujols gets hot at 
the plate.  Neither pitching staff looks all that impressive right now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The AL is quite the opposite.  Both teams are pitching well, and the Tigers 
looked especially strong in games 2-4 against the Yankees.  As for the 
Twins, since we'd all agreed that Frank Thomas was the only A hitting well, 
I was baffled that the Twins kept pitching to him.  (Also, their defense was 
horrible, and that's baffling.)  Since I'd already picked both the As and 
Tigers to lose, I won't bother to pick the ALCS, but I'll stand by the AL 
over NL pick for the WS.  One interesting aspect of the ALCS is that it pits 
Dave Dombrowski against Billy Beane - two of the most widely respected GMs 
in the business.  While it's not <b>that</b> stunning that the As finally won one 
of these postseason series, the entire Tigers story is compelling.  When 
Pudge signed there two years ago, I figured he was just in it for the 
paycheck, and that it was foolish for a last-place team to spend money on 
Pudge of all people, who was likely in the last few years of his career. 
Boy was I wrong!

I was also 1 for 4 (I had the same picks Rick had).  Apparently you don't 
have to be playing well going into the playoffs to actually win in the 
playoffs.  While I thought the Mets had enough talent to overcome a 
late-season funk, the Tigers and the Cards were more than a surprise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have to stick with the Mets over the Cards.  I think that New York just 
has too much talent for them.  Figure 5 games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The A's &amp; Tigers is about as wacky as it gets, but let's remember that it 
wasn't all that far back in this season that Detroit was considered easily 
the best team in baseball, so I'll take them in 5 as well.

Just learned of an interesting tidbit: all four of the remaining teams in the

the Mets in '86 [ouch] and the A's in 1989).

<i>((And it's looking like the ones who have not won in the longest are the ones going back,
doesn't it.
I wrote a note to Mark Lew: "I think the A's are sitting quite pretty right now, except
for the disaster in the middle infield, which doesn't seem to have
hurt them yet.  Are there any reinforcements coming in for the next
round?  It might be Detroit which just improves the A's chances, I
think - though I think they'd also beat the Yankees."))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Mark Lew (Sat, 7 Oct 2006 10:41:19 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think D'Angelo Jimenez will continue to start at 2B. He's better than
anyone else we've got.  I do think they'll bring someone up for the
next series, but only as a backup.  There's no obvious choice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't know if you heard, but besides Crosby and Ellis, Antonio Perez
also got hurt right at the end of the season.  He was our third-string
infielder (picked up from the Dodgers in the Bradley-Ethier trade) who
was on the big-league team for the whole season hardly ever got a
start.  Our fourth-string infielder was Mike Rouse, who came up for a
couple weeks during the middle of the season and played very well.  In
spite of that, the management must have projected him as having a
modest ceiling, because the last time we needed a spot on the 40-man
roster we put him on waivers (essentially choosing Jimenez over him),
and he was picked up by Cleveland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That leaves two possible courses for bringing someone up.  One is to
dig down to AA, where we've got Mark Kiger or Kevin Melillo.  Both are
prospects who look mildly promising but nothing spectacular. Neither
would be deemed ready for the majors now were it not for the emergency.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other idea is Keith Ginter, who was a second-string major-leaguer
for many years before we got a hold of him and sent him down. We got
him at the start of 2005. At that time Ellis was recovering from the
major injury that had him out for all of 2004, so we needed a backup
plan in case he wasn't any good coming back. (Beane was inquiring after
several good 2Bs that off-season, but Ginter was the only deal he
made.)  Ellis turned out OK, so Ginter got demoted.  In 2005, he got
the same treatment Antonio Perez did this year: ie, a guy with major
league experience and a decent record, but we almost never started him;
therefore, he never found his swing, so when he did get to play he was
terrible, so then he went back to the bench and ended the season with
horrible numbers on a small sample size.  For 2006, Ginter spent the
whole year in Sacramento where he did well, and became a free agent at
the end of the season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That raises an interesting rules situation.  The rules on adding to the
playoff roster are convoluted already, but basically (as I understand
it) if a player is injured, a team is allowed to bring up pretty much
anyone in the system, subject to the League approving it as legitimate
and not abusing the rule with a dubious "injury" (the "K-Rod rule").
Ginter raises a question which hasn't come up before so far as I know.
His contract was due to end at the end of the 2006 season.  Since he's
in Sacramento, the season is over for him and he's a free agent.  But
if he's called up, the season isn't over for Oakland and he's not a
free agent yet.  So is he in the system or not?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The A's have already inquired with the League on the question, and the
ruling was that if they sign Ginter to a 2007 contract, they can put
him on the playoff roster, but if they don't they can't.  This creates
an interesting negotiating situation.  Ginter obviously wants to get
back in the big leagues, and since Oakland was keeping him in AAA, he
fully intended to explore the free agent market.  The A's presumably
want to re-sign him for AAA, which according to the League rule would
be sufficient to put him on the playoff roster now.  Even as a backup,
Ginter is a better choice than the AA guys, so the A's need him and he
knows it, so he could try to use the situation to wangle a major league
contract for 2007 that he might otherwise not have gotten.  On the
other hand, signing any sort of contract means he gets to be in the
playoffs now, on a team that has a reasonable chance of going to the
World Series, so he doesn't really want to miss out on that, so the A's
might use that to wangle a minor-league contract that they wouldn't
otherwise have gotten.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My prediction is that Ginter will indeed end up on the roster.  My best
guess is that they sign him to a modest one-year major-league contract
and then probably trade it during the off-season.  Beane only cares
about the price tag, in terms of what he might have to eat and/or
tradeability of the contract.  Making it major-league rather than
minor-league is more a matter of pride, and it looks better for both
sides if he's technically a major-leaguer.  I think Ginter is still the
backup behind Jimenez, though it's likely they give him a chance to
prove himself, and then keep him in if he does well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P.S.  One more guy who could conceivably end up at 2B for the A's is
Hiram Bocachica.  He's a veteran utility guy who has bounced back and
forth between big leagues and AAA.  He's been injured a lot in his
career, and he was out for about a year in 2005-06, but he was tearing
up AAA late in the season.  He's been with several teams, most recently
Seattle, from whom we picked him up at the beginning of 2005.  I think
he was considered a possibility for the big leagues then, but since
then he's fallen into the "AAAA" category.  He's the one who was added
when Perez got hurt, so he's already on the playoff roster now.  He's
one of those versatile players who has played every position but
catcher.  He started out as a 2B in the minors, but has been almost
exclusively outfield for the past few years.  Presumably he's not a
great idea at 2B, but he's at least a fall-back plan.

I'm behind on the story, so maybe you already heard.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's decided to bring up AA guy Mark Kiger, for the reasons I mentioned
in the last email: not likely to play anyway, and he has the best
defense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ginter has complained that he wasn't treated well in the process, which
is probably true.  Team gave him a look, decided against, and left him
with nothing.  Ginter can't be entirely happy about spending all of
2006 and half of 2005 in AAA either, so I don't suppose he likes the
A's organization very much.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to EUROPE):  The English people are disturbed at the rumors of 
war coming from the continent.  It is hard to believe that any leader 
would send his people off to war over something as insignificant as 
control of so called "black dots".  The peace loving people of Britain 
will stay aloof from any conflict (unless dragged in to protect vital 
national interests of course...)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN (DIE ZIETLUNG)):  Kaiser Marcus I announced the commencement 
of defensive maneuvers in the West.  "After the violent incursions from 
the vintners in Burgundy, we have shifted a few light units of brewmeisters 
into the region to replant vines with hops.  Truly this Oktoberfest 
will be one to remember in the glorious annals of Germany."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ministers were dispatched to all powers fully noting that the moves were defensive 
only and evidence no intent to have any hostile action to any other power in Europe.  
"We have the fondest feelings to all our friends in Europe, as long as Burgundy 
and the Low Countries are pacified under a multilateral Prussian peacekeeping 
force, central Europe shall rest at ease."  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In other news, fishermen in the Baltic note that the seas are calm and that 
the fish are teeming.  "We hope there will be no concussions to spook 
the fish this year," stated Georg Bassmaster a local fisherman.  
German military officials immediately responded promising no action in the north 
to disrupt any fishing fleets from any nation, "Sweden can rest easy under 
Russian protection."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE):  Spies on the continent picked up many indications 
of a move into the Channel.  This move is defensive - simply the Royal 
Navy on exercises.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SISKO'S LOG - UNKNOWN): Something has happened.
One minute I'm fighting Gul Dukat on the fire cliffs of Bajor, then suddenly
I'm here, in my dad's restaurant in New Orleans with Bashir, O'Brian, Odo,
The Major, my dad, and Jadzia Dax.
These are my people but this is not my universe.
For one thing, there are no Klingons in this universe, and another, Jadzia is 
supposed to be dead.
I am totally unfamiliar with the local alien groups.
On the other hand, I could be in worse places than eating Cajun food in my
dad's restaurant.
I'll figure it out later, Sisko out.

(JAMES FAMILY to JEFF IN OHIO):  The METS! METS! Always the METS! We 
won't even use the "Y" word in this family.

the college football season has been going on forever...or is that 
just in Syracuse?

1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that Jeff O'Donnell has changed his postal address, at least temporarily.
And you should use his cell phone number above if you want to call him, I think.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Obviously, both German armies cannot successfully retreat to Munich, so I've
treated it as one retreat and one annihilation in the SC chart.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note Jeff's new temporary postal address above.
You also might want to use the cell phone number, as a result, if you 
want to call him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-JIM-BOB): I'm not sure if I follow you, but maybe this will help you 
see what I'm doing. As though I was Turkey:
F Tys-Ion,
F Ion-Apu,
F Rom-Tus,
F Blk S A Bul-Rum,
A Bul-Rum,
A Rum-Bud,
A Alb-Tri,
A Ser S A Alb-Tri,
F Con-Aeg,
A Ank-Con.
I'm figuring that Fred is likely to be ordering:
A Mos-Sev,
A Ukr S A Mos-Sev,
A Gal-Rum,
A Bud S A Tri,
A Tri S F Adr-Alb,
F Adr-Alb.
Now, I look and see how I fared. For the fall, I'll look at what I'd do 
as Turkey with what Alexander did do. In S09, I'll flip it and see how I'd 
fare against Alexander.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to SEAN): Yes, well, Sean I do think you're still off, but
it is a good exercise to be undertaking.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): Wow!  The Romulans have decommissioned a troop transport
on the Ferengi front and a front line Galaxy class Bird of Prey 
defending Deep Space 2, which is now defenseless.
We are signaling for the remaining Romulans there to learn how to
speak English.
If the Children of Tomari stay out of the war, I now believe that victory 
will be ours.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD): I agree with Jeff. I honestly don't see how Kurt and Eric 
Ozog, Jeff and I, or Jim and David Burgess playing together in the same game 
is any different than Eric Ozog and Terry Tallman playing in the same game. 
We're playing to win, so I don't understand how it matters.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): We are now attempting to break out of this universe using
a Protomatter device.
If successful, we will be duplicated.
One group will stay in this universe, the other into a hopefully more friendly
universe.
A Conversation between Kirk and Spock follows.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Captain, our attempt to break out of this universe was not as 
successful as our last duplication.
Something went wrong in the Protomatter stream.
Our counterparts in the new universe were probably not duplicates, although
they had a definite Federation signature (Spock hesitates).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): What's wrong?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): After the malfunction, the matter stream had an odor to it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): An odor?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Yes, Captain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): What kind of odor?  (Spock hesitates again)  Out with it!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Cajun Food.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Cajun Food?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Cajun Food.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Any idea why?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): The Federation is composed of multiple humanoid species.
There is only one place where you can get Cajun Food, at least initially.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Earth.  I wonder what it all means?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): We probably will never know.....

something to do with a magician, Eisenheim the
