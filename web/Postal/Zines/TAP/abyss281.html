<br /><br />A bit late again, but getting better.... slim and fast this issue.
I don't think I have any more subszines in hand right now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday.

David Wang still has the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can start RIGHT NOW to pick up one of
the unclaimed teams and play it this year!
You may recall that 
I got myself TORCHED in free agency and my team was pretty well decimated
in hitting for average and power.
And I predicted that I'd be lucky if I hit 100 homers and bat .240.
But, as Goz will tell you, I'm a horrendous seer and so I'm almost
playing .700 ball and I'm leading the league in both hitting and pitching.
Go figure....
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.

By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR SYLVAIN LAROSE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sylvain played a LOT of FTF all up and down the East Coast back
in the late 1990's and then disappeared, I think he lived in Montreal
at that time.
John Quarto in particular keeps bugging me about finding Sylvain,
so I thought I'd toss him in here.
He shouldn't be THAT hard to find, but I've looked and failed.
Now it's up to you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski, Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi everyone,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sorry for the form letter. Some of you have already received the full
results of DipCon XXXVII. If you haven't, a summary is below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I will be sending out a full DipCon Report as soon as possible. The full
report will include the results as well as other information about the
games. Info on the scoring system, some comments from players and TDs,
as well as a report on the DipCon XXXVII Society Meeting. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you're interested in receiving a copy of all this on paper, send me
your mailing address. I thought publishing a paper version might be a
nice touch given the good representation we had from the postal hobby. 
<i>((I need to remember to ask Chirchill for this!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Might be a few days before I get this out, as I have 3 finals and 2 term
papers to finish in the next 7 days, but it will show up eventually. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks again to those of you who attended, and sorry for missing those
of you who didn't. I hope we see you all next year as we take DipCon to
sea!

my second movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just thought I'd let you know that the second movie I've written and
produced, a gay zombie vampire film-noir comedy called <i>The Night Life</i>, is
now available over the Internet at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.planetout.com/popcornq/db/getfilm.html?64225

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(It looks better on a movie screen than in a little QuickTime window, of
course.)
It won first prize in the animation category of the PlanetOut.com Short
Movie Awards (which is why it's now on the PlanetOut site), had its world
premiere last month in Miami, and had its Canadian premiere here in Toronto
three days ago.  So far, it has been very well received.

Doug's stories as much as I am...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Doug Kent (6-1-04)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I haven't found much time, or inspiration, to do any <i>DW</i> writing,
but eventually I will.
Instead I've writtena few short stories, continued slight progress
on one screenplay and the book on my family, and I've nearly
completed Heather's birthday present - a list of 500 reasons
why I love her.
Corny, but just the kind of thing she'll appreciate.
Our relationship is still full-steam ahead, with plans to marry when I get home.
I couldn't be happier.
<i>((That's great to hear!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My biopsy results came back as displastic nevis - a benign pre-cancerous
growth.
I will see the dermatologist again in September.
The only other negative aspect of this experience was that it took
6 weeks to find out the results.
I'd go to sick call at least once a week, only to be told they weren't
in yet.
When I finally saw the results, they were dated in early March.
Figures.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The position of the PA not doing the excision I believe results from
their clear inexperience in most matters.
If I had to guess, I'd say at least one of the PA's here got his job
by submitting the lowest bid or something.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had another fun medical experience in late April. 
I developed two cysts - one on my right wrist (grape-sized) and on my
left buttocks (plum-sized).
I also had terrible night sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking.
The PA's put me on erythromycin at first, which didn't help at all.
Then when the cyst on my buttocks burst (I'll leave that to your
imagination) they switched me to Cipro for about 20 days.
Eventually I recovered, but for a while there I felt worse than
I ever had in my life.
They took no blood tests, no biopsies or swabs of the cysts, nothing.
They told me "policy" is wait two weeks to see if the antibiotics worked,
and then explore other options.
I've decided the best strategy for me now is "Don't Get Sick".
<i>((No kidding, were they going to try leeches and bloodletting next??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rumors in this place continue to swirl.
Now they involve only either closing the camp entirely, or moving the RDAP
inmates to another location.
RDAP is the Residential Drug and Alcohol Program, a 500-hour in-depth 
treatment course, which I have been accepted into.
I won't start until next year, but if I successfully complete the program,
I will get about 9 months off of my sentence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Libra Act I mentioned is actually called LERA, and through outsiders
on the Internet I've found it is not likely to be passed for three or
four years.
Far too late to help me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think your description of the Mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines
is accurate.
They were put in place to correct problems where Judge A was letting people
off with 3 months, while Judge B was putting people away for the same 
crime with 36 months.
But now with these guidelines, there is no perspective.
For my crime, a loss of about $550,000 which was not theft and which
I could not have personally profited from, I was sentenced to 46 months.
I read last week that the CFO of Rite-Aid was sentenced to 26 months
for his part in that company's <b>$1.6 Billion</b> accounting scandal.
In the end, guidelines or not, it's still the same as it always was....
when you have the money for an expensive legal team, you get a better deal.
When you rely on a Public Defender (as I did) and you are <b>100%</b>
honest from Day One (as I was, a year before I ever heard from the
government) you get the shaft.
The private lawyer I met with for 10 minutes before he found out I 
couldn't afford him told me POINT BLANK - if I had $300,000 to
spend on my defense I would NEVER see prison time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My Texas Rangers continue to play rather well.
<i>((No kidding, even better since you wrote this!
They may show that the best way to win IS to dump A-Rod.
The Yankees will have to find that out next.))</i>
If they do better than .500 ball I'll be thrilled.
<i>((I think that's about the minimum at this point.))</i>
Michael Young is finally getting the praise he deserves.
Here I'm surrounded by pompous Yankee fans.
Seeing the Rangers take 2-of-3 in Arlington was wonderful.
I'm hoping for at least 1-of-3 in the Bronx this coming weekend.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I guess I'll wrap it up for now.
Stay well, and stay in touch!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just cleaning out the attic... Baseball odds &amp; oddities...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All-Star game:  I'm no longer sure what this game means anymore.  When I 
was growing up I got to see players that I'd only get to see a few times 
a year, and they would really put out for the fans, but in the end it 
was just exhibition baseball.  Now we get to see all 162 games of every 
team in the majors (plus Montreal and Kansas City), and the stars have a 
well-publicized good time.  Somehow I don't think anyone will be plowing 
into a catcher with the winning run like Rose did in '70.  Too much 
money out there.  The voting is a bit perplexing too...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The early fan voting has Nomar leading among AL shortstops, even though 
he hadn't played a game when the first votes were released.  One wonders 
if he could win a fans' MVP vote if injured the whole year.
<i>((Hhahahahahaha, that was a joke right?
I laughed....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now the starting NL catcher is Piazza.  I can live with that, 
since he now owns the All-time catcher HR title.  Right now it looks 
like the starting NL pitcher is going to be a 41 year old who recently 
retired from the Yankees and now has a 9-0 record with Houston.  Insert 
your own joke here about this battery combination.
<i>((Unfortunately this is NOT a joke.... I wonder if Roger will intentionally
cross up Piazza and then fire a fastball right into his crotch?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't know why you got so down on your Giants in May (MAY!!!), as they 
went on a 10-game streak immediately after, and no one will run away 
with that division.  Watch out for the Padres, but I'm still picking SF.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Royals lose a doubleheader to the Expos, and now Beltran is on the 
block.  I wonder if Bernie Williams is willing to move over?...
<i>((Looks like those aforementioned Astros picked 'em up, but credit
Billy Beane and the A's for another Steal and Billy picked up a million
bucks in the trade.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Cubs and Angels have managed, despite having multiple injuries to 
many starters, to stay in their respective races.  This is where the 
inequity of baseball really comes into play, as the Pirates couldn't 
have backups as good as this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can I just say I hate interleague play?  I don't much like the uneven 
numbers in the divisions either.  (Note to self:  fix these when I 
become commish.)
<i>((Can I say I completely agree with you??
The interleague thing has MORE than run its course.
Put it to bed.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hope all is well there Jim-Bob.  I've been to the emergency room twice 
this past week:  once each with Nathan and Carol, but we're all getting 
better now.  Take care.

<i>((Thanks Goz, will be great for stuff in this issue!
I'll let you wait for most of my responses, but I was thinking the
same thing, I gave up on my Giants WAY too soon, and the way I
rooted for them in the 1970's..... I'm just ashamed of myself....
and at this writing, I think they actually are three games up in
the NL West, go Barry and go Giants!!!))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I've never been a particular fan of the All Star game, though it
is marginally better than the All Star games in each of the other
sports, so I should say up front that I don't much care about the
"purity" of the All Star game in the sense you mean.
As for the All Star voting, you again (as usual) misunderstand.
The Managers' picks are supposed to be for the people who are having
the best seasons (which is why they choose ALL the pitchers) but
the starting player spots are for the players that the fans want to see.
Pure and simple.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((With A-Rod shifting positions, Nomar is the man.  All the fans needed
to know was: he would likely be back before the All-Star break.
This makes perfect sense to me.  Would you rather they choose Jeter?
The Yankees are being so lame, in my view, A-Rod should be at Short,
Jeter at third.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Warren T. Goesle (Sun, 13 Jun 2004 11:34:16 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the voters wanted to see something at short, they should pick the White
Sox' Valentin.  Lots of power for a SS, and when he throws to first it often
winds up in the 4th row.  If that's not entertainment I don't know what is.
At least he's showing up to play this season, unlike Mia Hamm's husband.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As of this typing the Yankees are 3 games better than anyone in MLB.  Are
you saying they could be even better?  Are you auditioning for George
Steinbrenner now?

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Goz, wgoesle of comcast.net</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Correct, in MY view, the Yankees could be EVEN better, just
by switching those two players.  Let's see if the Yankees
win it all, THAT is the question and that is what I say won't
happen...... again.
And say what you want, fans vote, they can vote for whomever 
they like.  You can complain, but you need to vote if you
want to change the result.
I also still think you should buy the Milwaukee Brewers.
Remember, that is a tried and true way of becoming the Commish.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Warren T. Goesle (Mon, 14 Jun 2004 22:32:51 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Certainly if you give the fans a vote on anything it comes out to a
popularity contest.  See several generations of "American Idol".  
<i>((I'm afraid I didn't and I'm not sure what you're talking about,
but go on....))</i>
The notion
of electing a part-time player to an all-star event is certainly not unique
to MLB, even this year.  NASCAR has an all-star race that it runs the week
before Memorial Day.  I don't remember how you actually qualify for the main
event, but you probably had to win a race in the last 12 months or be a
former all-star winner or something.  The other way to get in traditionally
was to win the "last chance" race run just before the all-star race.  This
year they added a second driver to transfer into the main event:  the winner
of an on-line poll, run for a few weeks before the event, though the winner
actually had to be on the lead lap of the "last chance" race too.  As
expected, the fans' choice was Dale Earnhardt, Sr.'s eldest son Kerry, who
had only run 1 race of the 11 run this year as a part-timer.  But he's got
the name to be elected in NASCAR.  As it turns out he didn't wind up on the
lead lap anyway, and the spot in the all-star event went elsewhere.
<i>((As long as it remains an exhibition, this sounds like a cool way to
generate fan interest.
And they get who THEY want.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So the New York fans will likely all get together for a write-in candidate
for AL All-Star starting shortstop:  A-Rod.  Makes as much sense as many
things in MLB.
<i>((Nah, looks like as Jeter's average improves votes for him improve too.
A-Rod still should be at short, but it will be interesting if the Jeter/A-Rod
combo starts the All Star Game....))</i>
The sport needs smarter fans, and fewer that think that MLB ends with the
Yankees and Red Sox.  NASCAR could use smarter fans too, in thinking on it.
<i>((But we don't care whether the NASCAR has smart fans or not......))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Apparently we don't much care whether MLB has smart fans or not either.
Odd fact for the All-Star game:  the Cubs may have 2 starting pitchers
selected.  Who'd have bet on Clement and Zambrano at the start of the year?
C'mon, raise your hands...

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Goz, wgoesle of comcast.net</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Not me, you're right.
But I really thought, and still think that ALL of those guys, Clement and
Zambrano included, are great starters.
By Sept. everyone could be saying that the Cubs have the best starting
pitching of any team in the Playoffs.
They will be VERY dangerous, much as you malign them.
Let's let someone else get a word in edgewise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Partly accomplished, not as much outside activity as I liked, but some 
to enjoy before today's storm threat.  Yesterday Jeff Bohner and I took 
his roomie's dog Cody to a park for a "dog socialization session" with 
my Mary Jane.  Cody was raised with little human contact, none with 
anyone but family, and has never been able to cope with other dogs very 
well.  So we took them in separate cars to Aqua-Terra county park a few 
miles from Binghamton, walked them on leashes a few minutes, then let MJ 
walk around a while so Cody could see her explore without trouble.  I 
taught Jeff to play Balloon Cup, then we let Cody free while I kept MJ 
with me.  He checked around but didn't run off and was okay.  A family 
with a large dog came by and the dogs were able to sniff each other 
without snarling conflict.  After more games and back at Jeff's, I 
brought MJ inside and Cody didn't object to her presence.  I think we 
gave him a helpful day in developing his ability to interact with other 
dogs.  I awarded Mary Jane a merit badge in Park Off-Leash 
Dog-Interaction Training for setting a good example by not barking, 
jumping up on people or other dogs, starting fights, or running off and 
ignoring our calls.
The weekend started off well, too, so you might want the next bit for 
the music section.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Friday evening 11-June I had probably the best musical time I've had 
this year.  The Coopertones played their debut CD release party at 
Castaways in Ithaca NY.  I've worked with John Behler for over six 
years, and I knew he played guitar in a local band with friends, but I 
hadn't gotten to a show since they started doing real paying gigs after 
ten years as a garage band playing friends' parties.  This time, I 
needed some live music and this was a good deal:  a five-buck cover got 
me a three-set show plus the CD (six originals totaling half an hour). 
The show was fun, a six-piece band doing 25 to 30 songs in three hours 
counting the two breaks.  Of all those songs, there were no more than 
two or three that sounded close to any of the others.  Only about five 
of those were covers; all the rest were originals, mostly 
collaboratively written, and they had quite a variety of sounds.  I kept 
hearing riffs and rhythms that sounded like songs I knew, but within 
music that overall sounded fresh.  It all worked pretty well.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There were only a couple of slow songs, and only one real ballad, "Junkie", 
written and sung by the band's only female performer, Meryl Young. 
Strong image of hollow eyes as first the love, then the person go away 
as a loved one loses to heroin.  The band's eponymous Cooper (first name 
listed as "R" where it's used at all) plays a miked acoustic guitar and 
seems like the alpha coyote of this old pack.  (John's youngest at 42, 
others range up past 50.)  Two electric guitars, an electric bass 
guitar, drumkit, and Meryl's various percussion instruments (or a 
breath-driven keyboard instrument) join Coop's acoustic for a 
rich-sounding variety.  Most songs had one member or another singing the 
lead vocal on the verses and chorus, with one or two others (sometimes 
the whole band) singing counterpoints or harmonies on backup vocals. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Coop and especially Meryl seemed to have fun on stage; Meryl was 
constantly smiling at another band member or at an old friend in the 
audience.  John played some great leads and over the course of the show 
everybody contributed some good performances.  I'm forty, but I was 
under the median age of the crowd; I was even under the average age. 
Not a lot of people but most seemed to be old friends of the band having 
a good time.  Even the active dance floor population averaged older than 
me, and this was the first time in years I've seen a woman older than 
myself dancing noticeably braless.  One of the most popular songs (and 
the one I'm most glad is on the CD) was "14850", which is Ithaca's ZIP 
code.  A few of TAP's readers would appreciate the lyrics, not just the 
obligatory weather and bumper-sticker jokes but ones about the colleges 
pumping out Ph.D.'s who ask you "Would you like that with cheese?"  The 
"new" (despite being recorded 17-Dec-2003) CD's title, GREATEST HITS 
VOLUME ONE, reflects their typical cheekiness considering it's their 
first release. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think I've only heard better live music once all year, 
when I arrived late and heard only the last set of the Riolo Brothers 
Blues Band at the Cyber Cafe West in Binghamton on 10-April, but one 
excellent set of mostly covers can't be scored better overall than three 
fine sets of mostly originals.  The Coopertones' show was most fun I've 
had with live music all year, and it's almost midyear.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The Italian Oktoberfest opening.... let's see which 1902 variant
off of it we see next.... my article on the opening was in the Pouch
last year.
See why the Italian Oktoberfest is just such a natural name for it,
no matter what ducks and other fowl may say....
of course, without the Italian builds, the options are a bit limited,
but the Duck apparently believes he needs no stinkin' builds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALIANS IN MUNCHEN!):  Oof.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WITH HELP FROM FRANCE):  Double oof.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AND RUSSIAN COMPLICITY):  Triple oof.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND): But I thought Belgian Waffles were your favorite!?!?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-FRED/KARL): Weren't you invited?  Awfully rude of them.  
I'll bring a beer for each of you in the foreign capital of your choosing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LIVERPOOL to VENICE): If you think what I did now was 
something just wait 60 years until we unleash the Beatles upon the 
world! You might as well surrender now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-ENGLAND): Apparently crushing Germany was out of the question huh? Is 
it too late to be friends?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND #2): In my scenario, you would have built two, Italy did
build two, and to keep the peace, I only built one.
Think about it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-WORLD): The owner of any foreign unit in German territory will 
be treated as an enemy of of der state.  
So feel threatened and get out at your earliest convenience, please.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-GERMANY): Apparently the beer party is going to be in Moscow huh? 
Bring it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN-PARIS): You're an enemy just because it's the German thing to do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA-BOARD): Well, England let's have some vodka in Moscow, bring it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOARD to RUSSIA): Break out that vodka, you'll need it to get through
this last item....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG UNKNOWN): An unknown force has taken over the universe
causing everything to stop.
Planets have stopped moving and rotating.
Sunlight from stars has stopped in midray.
Meteors and comets are in suspended animation.
Our perpendicular universe Ferengi ship is also in suspended animation.
We have been thus far unable to determine the cause or the reason why the 
interior of our ship is somehow immune to the effect.
(A conversation, Spock(S), Kirk(K), and McCoy(M))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K-Dr. McCoy, I want you and Mr. Spock to meet me in the administrative center
of the ship to discuss our situation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-Let me guess, Mr. Spock has a theory!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K-Face it, Bones, (DeForest Kelley being dead kinda adds a whole
new dimension to the nickname "Bones", don't ya think?!) without
Spock's theories the ratings for the show would kinda suck.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Spock walks into the room last and glances at McCoy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-Thrill us with your theory as to why the Universe has stopped.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-It's Q.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-Q?!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-That's right, Doctor, the all-powerful Q from the Q Continuum.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-Damnit, Jim!
Q is not supposed to have any effect on us until the Next Generation
series.
What is he doing here?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-The same question could be asked of 6 of, I mean 7 of 9.
What is she doing here?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-When it comes to 7 of 9 not being around, I'm not one to complain.
Why do you think Q is responsible?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-Because in the past, Q has admitted to being a Boston Red Sox fan
and because the history of baseball in our historical database has been
altered since my last research on the New York Yankees.
I'm surmising that Q has spent so much time in April of 2004 watching 
his beloved Red Sox that he doesn't have time to deal with the rest of
the universe.
The fact that the Red Sox were in first place for the better part of
a month could have Q so emotionally drained that he, on his own, chose
to suspend all of the universes under his control.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K-So what happens to the Red Sox in '04?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-They become the first team in history to blow a three game lead and lose
the World Series to the Chicago Cubs 4 games to 3.
The key for the Cubs was Game 4 in Chicago.
With the Red Sox up 1-0, in the bottom of the ninth, and Pedro Martinez
pitching a perfect game: with one out, second baseman Omar Vizquel (traded
from the Cleveland Indians) strikes out on a ball in the dirt and makes
it to first base.
Martinez was so rattled after that he hit Moises Alou with the next pitch.
The runners advanced to 2nd and 3rd on another wild pitch and that led
to the most bizarre Red Sox loss ever.
With one out and runners on 2nd and 3rd, Sammy Sosa hits a routine fly
ball to short left field.
Manny Ramirez, thinking there were two outs, catches the ball and
starts celebrating what he thought was a Boston World Series win.
While Manny was celebrating, the runners on 2nd and 3rd tagged up and
scored the winning Cubs runs, 2-1.
Pedro Martinez becomes the first pitcher in World Series history to pitch
a no-hitter and lose.
<i>((According to the rules of no-hitters, this actually would NOT be 
classified as a no-hitter, since he never got the 27th out.....))</i>
I might further hypothesize that Q himself is responsible for the Curse
of the Bambino and that Q himself might even be Babe Ruth.
There is a resemblance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K-I'm not convinced we can blame these events on Q, Mr. Spock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-I appreciate your skepticism, but how else can you 
explain the Red Sox losing four 7 game series over a period of 49 years,
without a World Series title?
Q is the only logical explanation because these occurrences are  
statistical impossible to occur on their own.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-OK, Mr. Ears, in your opinion when will the universe start
functioning again, in your opinion?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S-Mid October, after the World Series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K-Do we have any Romulan ale?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M-No!
But we do have spiked Ferengi bootleg cockroach juice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K-(looking like a man wanting to fall on his sword)
Where's the nearest airlock!?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note Jim Tretick's E-Mail address change.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Some draw proposals, an EFG and an EFGIT are proposed.
Please vote with your summer orders on both, if you fail to vote
neither can pass.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) The Germans have another strategic hold, but I'll be damned if
I'm going to call a standby, the Duck will play and take the 
consequences, he called and talked to my wife, but this is
what we get.... the dogs of war are unleashed on him below....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EDI-BER): We appreciate your fortification of land forces.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to EDI): Now if he just could order them....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ROME to BERLIN):  Hey, pal, if you're not gonna bother responding to 
multiple missives at the most crucial diplomatic point in years, even to 
say "no" or lie, feel free to NMR out any time now.  Not unlike your 
GMing where Gary invested more effort in publishing your flier than you 
did when you abandoned it.  Why did you bother going to DipCon if you're 
not gonna play the game - did you insert earplugs and tat doilies 
between deadlines?  If this press pisses you off, great; that would be 
more interesting than playing with you this way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB): My, my, we are annoyed today, aren't we?  ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ROME to BOOB): Not nearly as much as that item sounds; I love Don and I'll miss him 
when he's no longer with us.  I don't know whether you guys felt he 
messed up your fun in 2001A.  I don't want him to mess up 2001D at a key 
decision point.  I'd prefer if he messed it up by negotiating 
ridiculously and making strategically unsound orders (as usual), rather 
than by ignoring me and submitting someone else's orders or NMRing every 
second or third season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ROME): I see, methinks you have a strong point, wake up,
you useless Duck!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SCOTLAND-WORLD): As an original with original allies, 
I intend to hang out in the northeast corner of the board drinking 
good whisky until an appropriate draw appears under my door in the morning.   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SCOTLAND-WORLD2):  If you bring good whisky, I can be plied 
to include you in the draw.  
Really good whisky and I'll exclude the combatant of your choice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY-ITALY): Gee, you don't know me very well do he????

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to MIKE BARNO): If as you say in your opinion my 
nephew is a psycho, then explain to me why you made an alliance
with him in the first place???
The question you need to ask yourself is: who is more of an idiot?
The idiot or, the idiot who gets his ass kicked by a psycho???
PS That is MR. Uncle Jeffy-Pooh to you!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY-ITALY PART 2): Well, Uncle Jeffy Pooh isn't here to 
save you lol lol lol

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EDI-CON): I trust you won't be so foolish as to attack StP.  
I will consistently move to make sure that can't succeed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UNCLE JEFFY-POOH to SEAN): I really don't think of you as a psycho.
I mean, after all, that stalking incident happened years ago, and 
I'm sure that all is forgiven.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Draw passes.  I'll have the SC counts next time, then 
continue to print End Game
Statements to the issue after that.
Thanks, everyone, I wish Buddy well in his illness motivated transitions.
I hope you (through Jim and directly) will keep in touch.
But given that Buddy was likely to have to resign, I think that pushed
everyone over the edge into calling it a draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>End Game Statements:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AUSTRIA STANDBY (Rauterberg):
This game, with its wide variance of challenges, proved to be 
quite an adventure for a standby Austrian.
I joined the game quite early on, allied with Randy Ellis' Turkey, 
and pushed back advances on my frontiers by Italy
and Russia.  Indeed, I was fortunate enough to be able to continue on 
into Italy and take over that country as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At this point, perhaps A/T was a bit TOO successful.  The nations 
of the West allied with Russia against us, and we were forced to think 
"stalemate lines" rather than to anticipate any further advancement.
Now Randy grew tired of participating in the hobby, resigned, and 
my implacable A/T alliance crumbled.  The rest of the game was an 
exercise in survival, and my Austrian forces were driven into Italy to 
make their last stand while the dogs of war snarled over my homeland.  
And so things ended.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
Fall 1916 is two game years by that measure.
PS I may do a GM judgment call that no "real" center movement
has occurred if there are only small insignificant trades of
centers that are done (that will include the one that looks
like it might happen this fall).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  So when will YOU be launching an assault on a 
Turkish home center?  Will that be before or after you read the GM's 
notes accurately?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
This was the last big move, Sandy popped back in to pop our leaders
one in the nose, and the leader Paul got his orders in as usual.
But the outcome is pretty well set now.
Come on, get those last fall orders in!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(COMMENTS FROM SANDY): Just thought i'd let you know that we have 
not fallen off the face of the 
Earth-at least not yet.  I'm actually sending in some orders!!  It has been a 
long time since I've sent anything in.  It has been rather busy around here 
lately.  The kids are getting out of school soon, so things will be even crazier 
very soon.  But that's okay.  I think I'll need a diversion soon.  Next month 
will be the one year anniversary of Sean's death, and I'm not so sure how I'll 
handle his birth and death days (July 8th and July 17th, respectively).  I 
think those are going to rather tough...Anyway, I hope you are doing well....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to SANDY AND THE KENNYS): We wish you the best and hope that the
next few weeks aren't too tough for you and the family.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
I'm not setting up a separate scoring method.
BUT..... we can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) WOW, some really tough racing this time, so many people popped up
on that ONE square, it really made a difference. 
And poor Paige missed the jackpot!!
The Sprint line is between 40 and 41, someone should start getting points next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOMER - SELF):  Ooh, I think I'll move to mile marker 10, and draft
the entire pack.  That's a better idea than rushing ahead to win the
first sprint.  (Looks up, sees two empty squares.)  D'OH!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LISA - GM):  Am I on South Beach?  All I see are sand, pebbles, and
clubs!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to LISA): I've got better than you.... yeah, this is just a 
lazy ride on the beach, there's Ty Law, he's the only one with
a 'tude around here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
($25 QUARTET): I think it's time for the rest o' you slackers to stop 
drafting behind my guys!  Hopefully I'm behind some of you now, 
and not behind in the bad way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to QUARTET): You hit the jackpot this turn and had the best
replenishments, now you need to see if you can turn 'em into 
points in the Sprint.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BART - FRANKLIN):  Hey dude.  You know, in Paris, your name is
pronounced Fron-clan.  You even have a metro stop!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MARGE - HOMER):  Our son is very learn-ed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(HOMER - MARGE): That's pronounced learnd, Marge. Learnd. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MR.&nbsp;BURNS - FIELD):  Did anybody catch me in the season-ending
episode?  Where I bought all the media outlets in town?  Rupert
Murdoch is my hero.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SMITHERS - MR.&nbsp;BURNS): ... and you're my hero, Mr. Burns.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MR.&nbsp;BURNS - SMITHERS):  Stop your snivelling.  And start pedalling
harder, I need to keep up with this race!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DAVE - TOM): It's Golden Strider that I can't seem to figure out, not Breaking
Away.  Explain to me again why Tim has won twice in a row by being the front
runner, and why, even knowing he was going to do that, we couldn't stop him the
second time?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) You all voted for the concession, so we're done. 
We even have some initial comments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "I'm so happy, focused on destruction!"
from "I'm So Happy", a song on the brand new Mekons release, <i>Punk Rock</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to BRITAIN AND SPAIN): I am joining you guys in throwing the 
game to Ukr.  It's going to happen, anyway.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PAUL to JIMBOB): At least with a smaller power, writing orders goes 
quicker....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT): Egypt surrenders, I'll send you the Star Trek season finale ASAP.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to DAVE PARTRIDGE): Nice win, you earned it.
PS your original fleet maneuver into the Ionian Sea was the difference.
Nice move!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UNCLE JEFF to SEAN): Russia still sucks!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UNCLE JEFF to SEAN #2): The Klingons also suck!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Here's a brief Summary by Sean O'Donnell playing as Spain in Fear and 
Whiskey:</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Initially I agreed with Russia in knocking Britain out hard and fast 
as the first spring orders approached Russia fell silent, but I continued 
the stance of an alliance vs Britain. To do this I attempted to form an 
alliance with Harry (France) and tried keeping communications open with 
Germany. I also managed to negociate a deal with Eric (Italy) for Tunis that 
I saw as tactical due to the fact I planned on attacking Jeff (Egypt) after 
France and I secured Britain. The only thing that actually held was I got 
Tunis.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Facing off with France and Britain forced me to seek aid from Italy, 
Germany, and Egypt. Poland apparently building a fleet helped going in a 
long way of Germany in a sense aiding. This situation I lucked out that Jeff 
was allied at the time with both Italy and Turkey I think at the time either 
way Egypt managed to send me naval aid that helped to stablize the war with 
B/F. The next helpful thing that happened was when Jonas was replaced John 
helped Germany whoop the tail out of France while Egypt and I booted France 
from Spain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
From this point on I had to keep my position up and make sure that 
Germany and Britain didn't overwhelm Spain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After that war, Italy and Ukraine after U/I/E devastated Turkey, I 
offered Italy Spanish aid against Egypt. Instead Italy attacked Tunis thus 
putting me on Egypt's side.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My biggest mistake I see in the game was backstabbing Egypt and 
Germany and not fighting Ukraine when it was suggested I do so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My biggest triumph in this game is really getting Tunis and managing 
to Survive to end game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In closing of this Statement, Grats to Dave (Ukraine) for a game well 
played.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Thanks, Sean, it was a long game, wasn't it??
You were quite young when this started, something like 17 and now you're 23??
Your grammar and spelling has even gotten a bit better.
I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did!))</i>
