<br /><br />We have a goodly number of subszines below.
Don Williams may be in trouble for finishing up his subszine and game.
I'm hoping that won't be the case, as his comeback has been
stunning (thanks in no small measure to Gary Coughlan).
You will all attest to that, I'm sure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is, of course, again quite late.  But I have made some progress
in clearing the decks of the issues that have made me late.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I ended a whole bunch of games I was in since we last spoke,
at least five!  For me, being in about eight games at once was
way too much.  I think I'm only in two or three now?  Just showing
that I'm not sure is one indication as to how screwed up I was.
Don't ask me to join any games right now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Work: my increasingly insane work situation is still insane,
but the manager two levels above me at one of my jobs
just quit to take another job and the positive
nature of this for me just can't be overemphasized.  He should
be a Peter Principle case study, just SUCH a nice guy and just 
SUCH a bad manager.
We're also being reorganized given this opportunity which
all should be to the good, but it may take a bit of time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) WorldMasters Tournament: I'm on the Tournament Management
Committee still, and still GMing one game with twice weekly
deadlines, but hey that pressure is lessening up a bit and 
the GMing will end very soon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) World DipCon: More on that below, you SHOULD have been there.
It was great to finally meet Hank Alme (!!!) and Mario Huys;
and great to see my local Boston crowd Mel Nicholson, David
Maletsky, Brian Shelden (by adoption) and Taylor Hayward;
Don Williams, Steve Emmert, my Norwegian bud Frank Johansen; 
Vic Hall, David Norman, and Gihan Bandaranaike from the UK;
Manus Hand, Bear Barrow, and all the great ARMADA folks;
my brother David (who I don't see enough), Andy Bartalone,
my Swedish bud Niclas Perez, Blue Cable, the estimable
Chris Martin, the steely Tom Pasko, the smooth David Hood,
the jovial Len Tennant, the determined Ray Setzer (who finished
14th, way to go Ray!!!), the befuddled (by the weird scoring
system) Irishman Brian Dennehy who far as I could tell
played four great "C-Diplo" games, but we weren't playing
C-Diplo; my good bud Rick Desper, the mercurial Mark
Franceschini, the inscrutible Steve Cooley (must be tough
having an LA District Attorney with the same name, Steve!),
the really neat Matt Shields, the stern Tom Kobrin,
the ubiquitous Jim Yerkey, the blustery Tim Richardson;
the BIG world traveler Sean Colman from Australia;
Yann Clouet, William Attia, and the other Frenchmen
(including the World Champion, see below);
Yarden Livnat, and BRIEFLY Cal White (who REALLY
hated the scoring system);
other Oldtimers Edi Birsan, Larry Peery, and Buz Eddy;
and especially new World Champion Vincent Carry, who has
come so far since I last played against him in a World DipCon
game back in 1994 in Birmingham.
Vincent stabbed me quite nicely for one of his wins and I finished
73rd again....  I say again, because in every one of my four
World DipCon's I've finished within four places of that.
There are pictures up of most of these people at the
Official Report site at:
http://diplom.org/armada/2003/results/results.cgi

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) I've been seeing how my "horizon" has changed with more
FTF play and more Internet interaction where I must admit
that postal PLAY seems less important to me these days.
But this szine is starting to seem more important too, so I 
think there will be changes that I will put in place
soon that will keep this going, but in some different ways.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
6) And lastly, we're planning a FTF tournament in Boston,
likely to be called Boston Massacre 2003, and likely on
the Summer Solstice weekend of June 21-22.
I want ALL of you to think about coming..... more details
soon, but I've got to publish regularly to publicize it!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />One other major announcement, I'm not going to dwell on it, but I guess
I need to do it in our current spam infested Internet.
I've had a number of complaints from people about harvested E-Mail
addresses by spammers from <i>TAP</i>.
Since <i>TAP</i> is a simple html file, spammers can create these spider programs
that hunt around the Internet for "@" signs and then harvest the text
on either side of that to find E-Mail addresses.
People have asked me to go edit all of the back issues of <i>TAP</i> which
seems to me to be an incredibly daunting task.
If anyone can tell me on the UNIX diplom.org system how to make
one global change, I'll do it, but the others are going to have to be
an as I get to it issue 
(unless you want to edit the html yourself and give it back to me).
Anyway from now on we'll do our own system (so spammers will never
figure it out globally) of using "of", so I will now be burgess of world.std.com.
You can all reconstruct an E-Mail from that.
Sorry about the past, but I'm one who really doesn't get that excited about
spam (I'm on the header of every issue, so I must get at least as much spam
as any of you from <i>TAP</i> and I only get about 3-6 spam E-Mails a day
which are extremely easily identified and deleted, even though I DO NOT
have filtering software on this account), but recognize that others' personalities
are different and congenitally have difficulty not getting upset by it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />And now I get to the usual header stuff.
I decided to can the sub price increase, the postal rate increase
really is peanuts, or it seems so at the 3-5 ounce level that I live it.
So, no problem, let's keep selling subs when I can at this price.
You all know that I'm an incredible softie anyway.
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance See the revised game start announcements below!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us

hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

The message:

 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally

Find him and win the fifty buck prize!!
You have until Issue number 270 to find him.
I want to tell Ed about Kathy and all sorts of other things.
There is a "full board" there now, help me out and earn
yourself some cash!!!
Ed Henry was very active in the hobby in the 1980's.
I don't think he's the same Ed Henry who's so famous right now working
on Kiplinger's magazine (writes the Car reviews and is African American),
but he could be.
Ask him and find out!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Berry Renken or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

See http://www.cat23.com/wm02 for full details.  Since I didn't get sufficient
interest to get a team in, I am back on the WorldMasters Tournament Management
Committee again.
There already is a big flare up between a GM and a player where the player now
says he doesn't "trust" the GM, and it's only 1901!
But in general, things seem to be going PRETTY smoothly for a tournament that got
way overwhelmed with 73 teams of 7 players, for a total tournament player roster
of 511!!!
All seventy-three games are up and running with GMs in mere days, an amazing
feat in itself.
Kudos to Tournament Director Rudi van Hal for a yeoman job thus far!!!!
Special thanks to Dave Partridge and Steve Hutton, who I conned into joining the
Tournament Management Committee as well.
Toby Harris is nearing another record first round 18 center victory, gee

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older
version of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,

DIXIECON 17

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Longest-Running Diplomacy Tournament on the East Coast - May 23-25, 
2003

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let the Carolina Amateur Diplomats host you for a Memorial Day Weekend 
of Diplomacy gaming in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on the beautiful 
campus of the University of North Carolina. Dixiecon features three 
rounds of Diplomacy as well as a Diplomacy variant tournament and other 
boardgaming in a format which has been delivering satisfaction to its 
participants from all over the country and world since 1987. Dixiecon 
has hosted the North American championships four times and World Dipcon
twice. Dixiecon is also the second leg of the four-part Eastern Swing,
which crowns an east-coast winner in Maryland at the Tempest event in 
October. This could be the year you are inducted into the Order of the 
Knife, the motley collection of past Dixiecon winners! All twelve were 
in attendance at last year's Dixiecon, which doubled as the 2002 Dipcon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A Word from the Director

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Diplomacy at Dixiecon is probably a little different from what you may 
be used to at other venues. Most Dip events have time limits for each 
game due to space and other considerations, and thus must have a scoring
system that ends games before they are truly over. While I enjoy playing 
in such tournaments, there is really nothing like having unlimited time 
to complete the Diplomacy games, which is how we play the first two 
rounds. We also go the extra mile to try to make sure you play against 
as many different players as possible. Come see if you are ready for an 
intense Diplomacy experience. - David Hood

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Description of Events

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, there will be a Pickup Basketball Extravaganza for all those 
whose Achilles tendons are still valid.  The Diplomacy tournament itself 
will consist of three rounds, one beginning Friday night at 6:00 and the 
other two beginning at 9:30 on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  The 
Saturday morning round will also double at the three-man team 
tournament.  After Round Two the whole crowd will eat North 
Carolina-style barbeque and then adjourn to various game activities such 
as a Diplomacy Variant event, a historical miniatures event, open 
gaming, or "festivities" on Chapel Hill's Franklin Street.  Those still 
in good shape will wake up the next morning for the last round of Dip, 
after which we will do awards and then open gaming until early Monday 
morning.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Schedule of Fees

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General Entry Fee $20 (Does not include BBQ, paid separately)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

There has been a whole lot of recent discussion on rec.games.diplomacy about

As part of the discussion, I cited three specific issues that I use to chart trends 
in the hobby, others may have other views:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) In tactics: the use of F Tri-Ven as an opening move for Austria in either
negotiation or actual use VERSUS F Tri-Alb as a near given for Austria.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) In strategy: the use of early "game long" alliance pairs or triplets VERSUS
more free wheeling styles that are fluid.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) In alliances: the use of Russia/Turkey as the "feared alliance" VERSUS Austria/Germany
as the "feared alliance".

"Narc" -- a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jason Patric plays `Nick Tellis' a young undercover narcotics officer who 
accidently kills an innocent bystander while trying to bring down a drugged 
out killer.  He spends the next two years on 3/4 paid suspension.  Ray Liotta 
plays `Henry Oak' the surviving partner of an undercover narcotics officer 
who was beaten and then had his brains blown out, possibly with his own gun.  
Tellis is a smart cop who is sinking into depression over not being allowed 
to be a cop.  Oak is a smart cop who goes over the edge and becomes the 
poster boy for police brutality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The problem is, the death of Oak's partner isn't getting solved.  There isn't 
anyone with the right contacts to chase it down, except for these two.  
Tellis is invited to please take a look.  He does and concludes that he needs 
Oak, becasue Oak knows more about the dead cop than anyone else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story is told in that old onion metaphor.  Everyone has an agenda, so no 
one ever tells the truth, or at least when they do, it's usually their 
version of the truth, based on either their agenda, or their partial 
knowledge.  Tellis starts putting it together.  With each new clue, the story 
changes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story is the real star here, and the direction, but the actors were both 
outstanding.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not for kids.

"The Recruit" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Good Movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Al Pacino plays "Walter Burke" a senior CIA operative who has come in from 
the cold to become an instructor at Langley.  He has unfailing instincts for 
spotting falsehood and talent.  He gets most of the good lines.  He says 
things like, "I'm a scary judge of talent" and "Everything is a test, nothing 
is as it seems", and one that he says a lot, "The most important rule is 
`Don't get caught'"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Colin Farrell plays "James Clayton" a computer genius who is also an athlete 
and who has been consumed since his teenage years with trying to find out 
what happened to his father.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Burke recognized in Clayton the sort of talent the CIA needs.  Clayton goes 
along because he thinks Burke knows something about his father.
The plot is developed around the characters as they go through training and 
become what Burke wants of them, secret agents.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This CIA isn't about the Tom Clancy analysts, this is more along the lines of 
007 with a license to kill.
Good story, good ending.

"Shanghai Knights" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not your typical sequel.  They didn't remake the original with more car chases 
and a larger body count.  What they did instead is go to England, drop a lot 
of names, and introduce a kid sister.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fann Wong "Chon Lin" plays Jackie Chan's "Chon Wang's" baby sister.  She has 
all the martial arts moves and is lots cuter.  Owen Wilson "Roy O'Bannon" 
falls for her hard.  He even considers becoming a better man.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story actually holds together, but doesn't get in the way of the action.  
Jackie Chan is still the greatest.  His comic action is truly wonderful to 
behold.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As always, "Roy O'Bannon and his side kick the Shanghai Kid" overcome 
formidible odds, and incidental accidents, to stop the villains.  I loved it. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree with you entirely.  I thought in particular that the whole bit
"back East" with Roy in the hotel was totally hilarious!
The "London killer" thing was a bit of a throwaway.  Fann Wong
just dispatched him in three seconds flat.  I also really loved
"Artie".
But for some reason my wife really hated it, oh well.
I think she just wasn't in the right mood.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She isn't alone.  Two men in conversation while I was leaving the theatre 
were saying that this wasn't any better than the `Tuxedo' which was really 
terrible.  I guess it's like "The Three Stooges".  Some people get it and 
some don't.  I come down on the don't side with them.

it would be pretty terrible.  But this really was good if you got
into it.  Charlotte got all of the diverse references (LOTS of 60's
references) but still found it annoying.  I think you have to jump
in with a movie like this and decide you're going to enjoy it and
then enjoy it.  The structure of the movie reminded me in many
ways of Die Another Day (even in the personality of the villain).
But Owen Wilson is just so cool.  I think he's fun and Jackie
Chan really was at his best here.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((While I'm interrupting, a few comments on some movies that Steve DOESN'T
talk about.
"The Quiet American" is stunning and subtle at the same time.
Some of you may have noticed that Michael Caine got an Academy Award nomination
for his portrayal of Graham Greene's cynical English reporter "stuck" in 
Saigon during the French military retreats and withdrawal in the early 
1950's.
Some of you also may have heard how Caine had to rant and rave to get Miramax
to release the film in the US, and it still is NOT in wide distribution.
The problem, of course, is that the "Quiet American" is anti-American
and as we ratchet back up our aggressive interventionist espionage 
capability is not politically correct.  
Still, we need to think and talk about our history, that is the only way
to analyze and avoid future errors.
This movie helps to generate discussion a lot, and is a great story to boot.  
Charlotte and I really talked about this one.
Strangely, it's very different from the 1950's movie with Audie Murphy
as the quiet American (Brendan Fraser shows some great range with a
great performance in that role here) that had Graham Greene helping with
the screenplay.  I haven't seen that old black and white since the
60's on TV, but some research revealed what I had remembered, that
the old movie told a completely different story from the book - this
one is more faithful - and Michael Redgrave played the Caine role
as much more of a straight derelict.
Caine's performance is highly nuanced and one of the deeper complex
(Diplomacy like!!!) roles I've seen on the screen this decade.
I'd vote for him for the Academy Award.
Lots of great on-location shooting in Vietnam too, I'm sure this movie
could not have been made at any time from the 50's to today except
now, and it still has a tough row to hoe.
Help it out and go see this one, you might think a bit and you won't
be disappointed.... caution, I suppose, you might get angry, really
angry, at some more recent US policies as you do that thinking.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Staying with the military themes, I also saw Maxwell's second great
Civil War installment movie, Gods and Generals, recently.
Unfortunately, Maxwell didn't lose enough of the turgid dialogue
of Jeff Shaara's book of the same name.
Charlotte and I were reminded why we banned the book from our house
a decade or so after struggling to read our way through it.
As many of you probably know, Jeff's late father Michael wrote 
perhaps the best historical novel EVER written around the Civil
War (in a very crowded field), The Killer Angels.
That book was the source for Maxwell's first Civil War movie, Gettysburg,
which is an absolutely stunning movie.
Gods and Generals has a VERY good performance by Stephen Lang as
Stonewall Jackson, some decent performances with terrible material
by Mira Sorvino as Fanny Chamberlain, some unknown TV actress as Jackson's
wife, and of course Jeff Daniels reprising his role as Mainer
Joshua Chamberlain.
But for the most part this movie is a shameful mess.
Robert Duvall does a MUCH worse job than Martin Sheen
did in Gettysburg as Robert E. Lee.
Duvall smirks his way through the role.
I just wanted to SLAP him!
The unpaid (I think) Civil War reenactors who do all the battle scenes
did a heroic job, although some of the "explosion" scenes are a bit
repetitive.
Chancellorsville, in particular, is screened brilliantly. 
But this is a very long four hour movie, and the spectacle doesn't stand
up to the characterizations.
Unfortunately, Jeff Shaara just doesn't have it.
Even the music is much less memorable and less effective for the drama.
This team is going to produce a third movie to finish off the war, I hope
they can turn it around and do something more like Gettysburg.
I worry that they will bring back Duvall and that won't work, he's a good
actor, but he has NOT captured Lee's peculiar extremes.
Of course, there is endless debate about what Lee's true character was,
but I guarantee he did NOT smirk!
The worst was his delivery of the infamous line, "It is good war is so
terrible, or we would grow too fond of it."
I don't have that precisely right, but you know the line I mean.
But, perhaps we overreact.
Some of the minor characters like Chamberlain's brother Tom, Confederate
Artillery Chief Alexander, A.P. Hill, Sgt. Killain of the 20th Maine,
the 20th Maine's first commander Adelbert Ames, and a variety of 
others portrayed lots of character in very little screen time.
And I know I was hearing some of that terrible Jeff Shaara dialogue
and automatically cringing.
So go see it, see what you think, and hope they do better with the third
movie.
If they're even allowed to make it now....))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I also, for something COMPLETELY different, saw "Old School" which really
surprised me on a couple of levels.
First, it was a better STORY than I thought it would be.
Owen Wilson's brother did a GREAT job as the real protagonist in the story,
so it was MORE watchable from that point of view than I had expected.
On the other hand, it was NOT as funny as I had expected.
In a pattern that I think everyone knows, most of the really good jokes
were in various trailers that I had seen previously, and it NEVER is as
funny to see the joke when you already know the punch line (though they
did play out the "Blue" joke more than you saw in the trailer to
productive mirth).
This is a shame, but the market seems not to be able to deal with it.
I try to miss the trailers and arrive late whenever possible.
Anyway, though, Old School is obviously not a great or deep film 
by any means, but it's pretty good.))</i>

"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In 1980 Chuck Barris took a look at himself and decided that he was fifty and 
wasn't getting any respect.  In fact, despite fathering a dozen or so TV game 
shows, most very popular, the critics thought of him as the person who did 
more harm to America than all of its external enemies combined.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, in an attempt to expunge his demons, and, set the record straight, he 
wrote his own `unauthorized' autobiography, where he told his life story from 
being a young boy trying to score with young girls, through being a teenager 
trying to score with teenage girls, to getting a job in TV as a means of 
scoring with young women.  He was never very successful in the scoring 
department, which caused great frustration, and lead to a series of bar 
fights.  He wasn't very good at that, either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then a wonderful thing happened.  He was approached by a secret part of the 
CIA who wanted to direct his anger.  He was trained to become an assassin.  
In the meantime his TV career started moving.  One of his appeals to the 
lowest common denominator game shows, The Dating Game, took off.  He started 
being a success, and as a success, had lots better luck scoring with young 
women.  However, just because his frustration was lessened his connection to 
the CIA wasn't.  He was sent out to eliminate `bad guys'.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
George Clooney put up some of the money to make the movie, directed it, and 
gave himself the role of Barris' CIA control.  He got Julia Roberts to play 
the `sexy foreign spy' and Drew Barrymore to play Barris' sex interest (love 
interest, maybe).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie was not what I expected actually.  I was going in looking for a spy 
spoof.  What I got instead was an interesting study of Chuck Barris, who has 
to be one of the all time dangerous minds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sam Rockwell did the Chuck Barris character perfectly.  I've only seem him in 
small roles up to now (he was the villain in Charlie's Angels) but he 
expanded to fill the screen in this role.  He makes Barris' claim to being an 
assassin almost believable.  He also showed Barris as a genius who really did 
understand how to communicate to the lowest common denominator.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One really great scene comes when Barris follows a beautiful girl into 
seclusion, where she tears him apart for being the kind of person who makes a 
living off of cruelly making fun of people without talent (The Gong Show).  
Rockwell goes from the cocky TV success who plan to score to the vulnerable 
nerd who stumbles away in defeat.

"Darkness Falls" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Darkness Falls is a small town with its very own monster.  A hundred years 
or so ago the town had a woman who exchanged gold coins for baby teeth.  She 
was known as the tooth fairy.  When two children disappeared the towns people 
went over the edge and decided she was at fault.  They hung her. Later the 
children showed up, unharmed.  Too late, she had already cursed the town.  
The children of the town whispered the story down through the generations.  
When you lose your final baby tooth, the tooth fairy comes for you.  If you 
keep your eyes shut she can't touch you, but if you peek, she will carry you 
off, or kill you on the spot.  The only way to escape her is to stay in the 
light, she hates the light.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Young Kyle Walsh peeked.  He managed to escape to a lighted bathroom.  His 
mother, who thought he was having a nightmare wasn't as lucky.  She stepped 
into his bedroom to show him there was nothing there.  The police concluded 
that Kyle somehow had killed his mother in an insane rage.  Kyle was locked 
away in an asylum and went from there to the foster system.  Twelve years 
later he still surrounds himself with light.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kyle receives a call from the girl who was verging on being his girlfriend 
when he was a child.  Her little brother has night fears.  He can't sleep, 
and he is afraid of being left in the dark.  Kyle's symptoms as she remembers 
them.  She's holing Kyle can tell her how he overcame the problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kyle returns to try to help.  He is received with disfavor by the young man 
who is (in his own mind) courting the girl, by the police who still think 
Kyle killed his own mother, and by the hospital staff who are sure there is 
nothing wrong with the child.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I liked the premise.  It was good to see Emma Caulfield doing something other 
than her Buffy the Vampire character.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unfortunately, instead of extending the premise, Kyle as the hero and 
considered to be the villain, the movie trotted out the monster and cleared 
it all up.  Lots of people getting killed.  Lots of too loud sound track.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not my favorite movie.

"Cradle 2 the Grave" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not sure what the title has to do with the movie.  Difficult plot to 
follow.  Lots of different factions of good guys and bad guys.  The bad guys 
have stolen a secret weapon (50 of them) from Taiwan (to justify Jet Li as 
the hero) and plan to auction them to the highest bidders in, of all places, 
the USA.  Right there you have to wonder at just how bright the bad guys are.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To bring this about they smuggle the weapon into America as diamonds (they 
look like diamonds) and then arrange a diamond heist (good caper) in order to 
get them back.  Excuse me?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, despite the illogic of it all, you still have Jet Li doing what he 
does, along with a few impossible stunts that were pretty amazing.  You also 
have DMX (Tony Fait a top thief) who does a pretty impressive job too.  There 
is an outstanding chase scene.  Hollywood keeps surprising me with new chase 
ideas, or variations.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mark Dascascos who used to be `The Crow' on television gets to be the bad 
guy.  Mark is pretty good at martial arts, but it is clear that Jet Li really 
had to hold back to make it look like a fight when the two finally met.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Ranting you may or may not want to put in <i>TAP</i>:
<i>((I LOVE ranting.....))</i>

a) 
In response to Eric's inquiry about Monk, I seem to recall that almost
all of his solo piano recordings were re-released a few years ago
(including some previously unreleased "outtakes") in a multi-CD
set.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
b)
Since sport gets mentioned in <i>TAP</i>, and so does politics, I'll mention
their current intersection, which is cricket and Zimbabwe.  
<i>((Sorry for the time delay.... this issue is sort of "over" now,
but I too found it VERY interesting following it on the BBC.
I did not hear how it all turned out after what you say here,
but I'm sure someone will pick it up and complete it.))</i>
Zimbabwe
is the country where Robert Mugabe "won" an election probably with
about 40% of the votes, and plans to take land from large landowners
to give to his political supporters.  (Incidentally, my opinion is
that many of the large landowners being white is irrelevant; Mugabe
just wants land so that he can buy enough support to stay in power a
little longer.)  The cricket World Cup, scheduled for the next month
and a half, was awarded to South Africa four years ago, with the
proviso that Zimbabwe and Kenya would play their first round matches
at home.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The English government has behaved very poorly in this situation.
They have asked, but not required, the English team to boycott their
match in Zimbabwe.  On the other hand, the English and Wales Cricket
Board faces a significant financial loss if they boycott the game, and
the government has refused to indemnify them against this loss.
(International cricket is the only level of the game that is
profitable; lower levels survive on subsidies from the international
game.)  It doesn't help that no formal economic sanctions have been
placed on Zimbabwe.  The Australians, also scheduled to play a match
in Zimbabwe, would also rather not play there, though their government
seems to be behaving more reasonably.  The Pakistanis, victims of
Indian boycotts of matches in Pakistan, don't want any more precedents
for political boycotts, while the Indian cricket authorities would
like their government to let their team play in Pakistan.  Namibia and
the Netherlands are also scheduled to play in Zimbabwe, but cricket
being very low profile sports in both countries, they are
insignificant to the situation, and the situation is insignificant to
them.  Some noises have been made about rescheduling the matches in
South Africa, ostensibly for security reasons, but the Zimbabwean
government has stated it will deny its team permission to leave
Zimbabwe for relocated matches.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Complicating this situation is the demographics of cricket in
Zimbabwe.  Although Mugabe likes cricket personally, most players of
cricket, both black and white, come from families that own large
tracts of land, and other supporters of cricket are mostly the urban
poor; both segments of the population belong largely to the
opposition.  Indeed, if the Zimbabwe team plays in England next summer
as planned, I would not be suprised if most of the players get their
families out of the country and apply for asylum.  This all puts
Zimbabwean cricketers in a difficult situation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The first match in Zimbabwe, with England playing, is scheduled for
February 13.  Australia is scheduled for February 24.  I don't know
how this will turn out.  Catch some BBC broadcasts.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></tr></table><!--hboxt--> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've got lots of openings in the subszines, check them out!!!
Especially, contact Rip Gooch for Railway Rivals as the following maps 
are available. 
Following each in parenthesis is the suggested number of players: 
Isle of Wight (3 or 4); Netherlands (3 or 4); Northern Italy Map P (4 to 8);
Spain Map SP (4 to 7); China Mk. I (6 to 8); Austria (3 or 4);
Belgium and Luxembourg (3 or 4); Southern Italy Map Q (4);
South Sweden Map SWE (3 or 4); Switzerland (3 or 4).
<i>Ripping Yarns Mk III</i> will take the form of a tiny subszine 
in Word as soon as Rip gets some people interested. 
Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You also can sign up for the next Breaking Away game, which is starting now.
Tom Howell currently is signed up, knock off the superstar, come on,
you can do it!!
So far, Eric Brosius and David Partridge want to challenge Tom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Harold Reynolds is willing to start a game of Colonia and one of Aberration.
I think the signup list for Colonia includes me, David Hood, Paul Rauterberg,
David Partridge, and (Yes, really!!) Konrad Baumeister.
That means we only need four more.
Sean O'Donnell is interested in Aberration.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, 
and Kurt Ozog are the only ones signed up for that.

1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed

You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and 
is guest GMing a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next "big" game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, could Harold give me an exact count
of how many are signed up?
Also, Harold ran a test game with Konrad Baumeister, Dave Partridge
and Paul Rauterberg
that you could look at on his website.
See the note above about the Diplomacy A to Z, which also is there.

1) The FREGT draw is reproposed.
I did have a request that we go back to where we were, which
is this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Paul Kenny tells me about his wife Sandy: "The best e-mail address to use 
for Sandy is our temporary aol account, Kennyshire of aol.com.
I set her up with a net Net-gate account, but as far as I know she
hasn't used it, sakenny of net-gate.com.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper, Sean O'Donnell, Alexander Woo,
and Kurt Ozog are in to be four of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".
But we do need official wings rules, which I seem to be unable to locate.
Can anyone assist me there?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "You animals can't see your own captivity;
and you won't ever come home now; you won't ever come home."
From Sally Timms crooning of the "Waltz" by the Mekons from 
<i>The Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-MEKONS): Is there a song that fits this game a little better?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MEKONS to SEAN): No.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOARD): Would any of you agree with my previous assessment?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF-ROMULANS): Can't we all just get along?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPANISH TRIBUNE): What are we doing again?????

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(QUOTED IN "A Comparative Study of the Effect of Bean Counters in Different
Cultures During Times of War"):
As Admiral Hawk (Hawk is an approximation of the Romulan name which might more
accurately be translated as "Raptor who strikes from the sky with such vigor he
uncoils his target's DNA") noted in his journal during the War of Federation
Aggression:
Nitpickers wanted me to justify my expenses again.  They can't seem to
understand that a few well placed agents are worth a fleet of battleships.  The
clerk I bribed for ***** (This term has no real translation.  An approximation
would be "the offal slung aside as the raptor feeds, too small to bother with
and left for the scavengers".  Suffice it to say that it is small in terms of
naval budgets, although perhaps twice the yearly salary of a Federation clerk.)
to use the same symbol on the maps for the Federation briefings for Birds of
Prey and Troop Carriers has already won us a battle, and I have high hopes for
the second clerk, who has introduced the "cost saving measure" of only
providing maps at every other briefing.  That should have the Federation
hopelessly confused soon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KLINGON LOG SUPPLEMENTAL): I've forgotten the coordination of the attack of 
my Birds of Prey near the interstellar war with the Romulans. Intelligence 
has been dead now for several months and there has been no word from Captain 
Kirk to give us the coordinates of the next battle. The only hope can be is 
that should we fail that we will bring honor to our houses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLE"MENTAL"): Given the option of attacking a new Romulan
starbase with force or defending our one starbase in Romulan space,
I've decided to play defense by attacking the Romulan supply line from
two directions and overpowering an isolated and surrounded warbird.
The maneuver is risky, but if successful could be the start of a long successful
campaign against the Romulans.
Kirk out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PS: KIRK to THE ROMULANS): Oh yeah!
Sez you!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ANONYMOUS): What are "wings" and where do I find the associated rules?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ALL): Well, wings are air units that can support attacks, but 
cannot take supply centers.
And you know I cannot find the associated rules, but we'll locate them.
