<p><br><p><br>Note that the szine is really, really late and that all deadlines are
adjusted to compensate.
More details below.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE WILL BE NOVEMBER 14, 1999</b>

<p>
Note that this is a NEW extended deadline here too.
David wishes me to pass along that orders are being accepted 
until the new deadline,
so if you missed the old one, you've still got time to get them in. 
This especially applies to the new game starts!
I have to get MY orders in, for example.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The Diplomatic Incident was another great time, though as usual I only was there 
on Saturday.
John Quarto came up from New York and Goz came in from wherever it is he lives
in the Midwest ;-)
The real surprise was Nick Parish from England..... well, he really only came
from Montreal, but he was great to play with.
The main Diplomacy game I played in had Nick as Austria, me as Italy, and
Dave Partridge as Germany.
Nick started out with that common British opening that I seldom see here,
the agreed upon bounce with F Tri-Ven.
It surprised me, because I was planning to move to Tyrolia, of course!
Well, I went with it and started an attack on Turkey anyway.
We tried to form a Central Powers alliance at various points as first England
and Turkey and then Russia went down for the count.
With four players left, Nick and Dave both started driving for a win and I made
a mad dash for the Iberian peninsula in hopes of solidifying a draw position.
I only made it as far as Spain(SC) with the hapless French player in Portugal.
The French player and I did our darndest to threaten throws of the win to 
Dave and Nick in turn.
But NOOOOOOOO!!!!
They wouldn't do it.
Finally, they wiped me out first, and then, with Austria at 17, there was nothing
to stop Austria from supporting Germany to Portugal for his 17th.  
A true 17-17 in a FTF game. 
Quite rare, but well played.
Nick didn't know how much he had taken me out of my game, and David was sitting
there laughing at my predicament!
Usually, I get taken out by some outlandish stab gone awry in these games, but
not this time.
Oh well, then we were up for two hands of Family Business, one of my favorite
card games.  
I can't recall who won the first, but I won the second.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.

David Wang's site also allows you to follow John Caruso's postal
baseball league that I am in.
My Boston Red Sox in that league captured the Eastern Division
title and defeated Lance Phillips' Anaheim Angels in the playoffs, Gary Behnen's
Blue Jays finish dead last, Don Ditter's Indians think they have a clean
path to the World Series, but really haven't the starting pitching to
make it, so Richard Edison's Twins beat them out and then beat me,
Dave Anderson's Tigers beat me up badly on the last turn, but fail to 
beat out the Twins for the last playoff spot by one game.
World Series results next time..... the hated Yankees defeat the Red Sox
in the real world in the meanwhile and torch the Braves to
win it all.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR MICHAEL HOPCROFT</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>No sign of Michael yet.  
I'm sure Michael is on the Internet somewhere and I always
thought he was fun to have around.
Someone will find him.
This is big bucks for me AND for the people who find 
the missing.
This search will carry through to Issue #230.

<p>
Let's get Kevin, Garret, Jerry, and Al found too!!!
 
<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<center><b>WORLDMASTERS99 SECTION (with letters)</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>This section explains the most important reason why the szine is very, very
late.
Unlike other delays, this really is a DIPLOMACY related delay.
I think we may have to deal with similar delays at times through the beginning
of the New Year, though I am going to try to get myself under control!

<p>
If you've had your head under a tree, the World's Largest Diplomacy Tournament
is currently underway by E-Mail, featuring over 550 players from all around the
world.
<i>TAP</i> readers who are participating are ENCOURAGED to write in commentaries
on games, or teams, or whatever.
The <i>TAP</i> team will be a special focus, even though most of this szine's
best players abandoned me for other teams.
We shall beat their butts into the ground.
I shall show them what opposing me means!!

<p>
I am playing Austria for the <i>TAP</i> team and got placed in a game
with the infamous Toby Harris as Turkey.
Toby did the full anti-Russian opening while Russia moved a mos-STP.
In Spring 1901, I bounced the Russian in BOTH Galicia and Rumania
while moving my fleet to Albania.  Italy moved to Apulia and
Tuscany with his armies and so there are NO threatening units
to Trieste and Venice for Fall 1901 and in fact Austria has 
absolutely NO foreign units adjacent to its home centers.
I have no further comment, but an interesting position,
isn't it?
Today, we are at Spring 1902 and Serbia is still unclaimed and likely
to remain unclaimed in 1902 as well.

<p>
The delay in this issue by three weeks (all deadlines were pushed
back as a result) was almost entirely due to this new tournament
since I am both playing and GMing on one week deadlines.
Until this tournament winds down in the Winter, there may
be other delays.
I hope not, by giving myself a full three weeks, that the next deadline in December
will hit fine, and then we will take the usual Christmas break into January.
Many <i>TAP</i>ers are in this tournament too, and they won't mind.
For the rest of you, shame on you for not entering!!!

<p>
I do have the comment from numerous people though that they would
rather that <i>TAP</i> carry on, on schedule, 
even in relative warehouse format.
Everyone is hereby warned of this likelihood.
This may push a few things into the New Year.

<center><b>DIPDOM NEWS SECTION (with letters)</center><br></b>

<p>
<p> Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double

<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what 
stance we (the hobby) should take (proactive in some way for sure) 
toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.
No word on precisely what this means yet, could it mean that
they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?
Stay tuned....
If you want to be part of the discussion, send the MESSAGE:

The big news this time is the beginning of the breakout of
Hasbro into official contact with the hobby.
See the two messages below.

<p>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<p>
I have received a packet of <i>Diplomacy World</i> and other material
from Doug Kent that I will pass along to the relevant parties.
I think that Pitt Crandlemire will be FULLY reviving <i>Diplomacy
World</i> in some form in the VERY near future.
For those interested in writing articles, this would be a good time
to start writing or contacting Pitt at pittc of syncon.com to assess
interest in your article topics.
A warning: if you're primarily interested in SUBSCRIPTION balances,
Doug Kent is in bankruptcy court and we are NOT getting any money
any time soon for anything from him, though my discussions on these matters
with Doug have been quite cordial.
So, PLEASE, hold your horses on discussing or raising any money issues
until Pitt can figure out what he is going to do.

<b>Jamie McQuinn (Tue, 12 Oct 1999 00:04:09 -0400)</b>

<p>
Fellow Diplomats,

<p>
I have what I think is some terrific news for the Hobby.

<p>
As many of you know I have been the custodian of the Hoosier
Archives of Diplomacy Zines.

<p>
This collection, created by Walt Buchanan, contains virtually every
Diplomacy zine published in North America from the beginnings of
the Hobby to 1978.  When I accepted custody of the collection, it
was with the understanding that I would preserve it and make it
available to Hobbyists and researchers.  My ultimate goal was to
find a permanent home for it in an academic library/archive.

<p>
I am please to announce that today I filled up my van with 33 cases
and delivered the Hoosier Archives to the Popular Culture Library of
Bowling Green State University here in Ohio.  They already have a
small collection of fanzines (SF, music, etc., even some
<i>Diplomacy World</i>) and are delighted to add these to their 
collection.

<p>
Alison Scott, the Head Librarian, will be inventorying these items
over the next several months, and then will begin the process of
cataloging.  The remainder of the Hoosier Archives collection
(consisting of correspondence, <i>Diplomacy World</i> subscription
records and camera ready copy) along with the more recent
acquisition of the Hobby Award plaques will be part of an archival
special collection.

<p>
All of these items will be available at the Popular Culture Library for
Hobbyists and/or researchers to access.  I believe that this is the
best solution for the archives.  I always considered the archives to
only be in my care temporarily.  Now they have a permanent home.
I have been in communication with Walt Buchanan about this and
he gives his blessings as well.  And now they are out of my
basement (just in time, since I may be moving again soon).

<p>
This now brings up two more important issues.  First, does she
want more?  You bet.  When I took on the HA, I received queries
from several people asking if I wanted more.  I said no!  No room!
When I asked the Head Librarian she said, ``yes, please!"  So,
those of you who have large zine collections and are loathe to toss
them, here's your chance.  As I said, they collect Diplomacy and
just about any other type of fanzine.  However, before you send her
anything, please contact her directly and let her know what you
have.  Here is her contact information:

<p>

<p>
Keep in mind of course, that if you are going to donate your zines
to the library, it is up to you to get them there.  They do not have
any funds available to purchase your zines or pay for shipping.
Which brings us to the second point:  No gift to a library is truly
free.  They will have many costs associated with the processing of
the collection.  Besides the staff time involved, they will need to
purchase archival quality storage materials that will preserve the
archives (folders, boxes, etc.).  If you or other members of the
Hobby would like to make donations to the library for the Hoosier
Archives, they will be gratefully accepted.

<p>
Make your checks payable to:  ``Popular Culture Library"

<p>
Mail them directly to Alison Scott at the address above, with a
notation that you wish this gift directed to the Hoosier Archives.

<p>
As part of the collection, I also received two cases of back issues
of <i>Diplomacy World</i> from the 1970's.  These are multiple copies that
were never sold when Walt was publishing <i>DW</i>.  With Walt's
permission I am going to sell these back issues as a fund raiser for
the library.  Watch for more information soon.

<p>
Please pass this information on throughout the Hobby.  Print it in
your zines, post it on the Diplomacy newsgroup and in the
Diplomatic Pouch, etc.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to
contact me.

<p>
Jamie,

<p>
I'm delighted at this news.  It is good to know the HA now has a permanent
home, and I want to thank you for your efforts.  It will be interesting to
see if this ever generates a Ph.D dissertation on a postal community.
Actually, I was approached about that years ago, but I don't think anything
came of it.

<p>
Of course you have my blessing to sell the back issues of DW as a fund
raiser for the library.  I would also to happy to work with Alison if she
has any questions about the collection in the future.  BTW, note my new
email address.

<p>

I had
the honour to spend a night at Walt's place in 1976 and got the opportunity
after Walt crashed to sift through the archives.  
<i>Graustark</i> #1, <i>Costaguana</i> #1, <i>Runestone</i> #1, 
any of the <i>Poictesmes</i> (pronounced Ptooey!) plus a lot of
other things.  You've done a good thing for hobby history by placing 
these zines in a place that (hopefully) knows how to look after and 
honour them.

<p>
A player support group is being formed world wide to be called the
Diplomatic Corps.  It is a non-profit incorporated in North Carolina.

<p>
The purpose of the DC is to provide a network of people world wide who
can help demonstrate the game or want to participate in the game in any
of its various forms: face to face (FTF), by email, postally, real time
email, conventions and tournaments.

<p>
The organization will also collect a membership fee ($15) and any
donations etc that can be obtained so as to channel them back to the
hobby.  For example providing reduced costs for hotel stays at the World
DipCon, providing prize support to tournaments etc.

<p>
We will be having some support from Hasbro who has already provided some
prize support for the World Email Masters Tournament.

<p>
The org will provide a quarterly newsletter and is establishing the
usual web sites shortly.

<p>
We can all expect a large influx of players shortly with the re-issue of
Diplomacy both as a computer game with interactive/net gaming and as a
new board game from Hasbro.

<p>
Having been in the hobby for the last 33 years I will be heading this up
initially and look forward to as much support as I can get from all of
you on this adventure.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>This section is about to get a whole lot slimmer.  Here are the last and final
votes.
Now I need to figure out some timings and get together to actually make a master
tape. 
Then I'll find a commercial service to copy them for me.
Once I find the cost of that, I will let people know the cost.
I am leaning toward a five dollar fee, so the people I've chosen below
for five dollar awards automatically get them for free.
There are a few other selected individuals who've been sending me tapes
and CD's and things who also will get them for free.

<p>
To encourage voting early, I picked five voters at random to receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff or to get
a free tape).
Tony Dickinson won the Round 5 prize, so we had three of the six Round 1 voters
won and one of the three Round 2 postal voters who also got five chances to win.
That showed the value of getting in early!!
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson ($5),
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters were John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
Round 2 E-Mail voters got four chances and were Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters were Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch;
they got three chances to win.
Round 4 voters were Roland Sasseville, Jr. ($5),
Don Williams, Brent McKee (2 votes left), and Andy York; they got two chances.
Round 5 voters were Mark Larzelere, Al Tabor, Jody McCullough, and that's it.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape - we're going for 90 minutes.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!
The CD way may still occur if someone steps forward and actually does it for me.

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; something from the B-52's;
the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

Assuming I understand the voting:

<p>
B-52's bullpen : Love Shack

<p>
Drug Music :
Ian Dury - Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll;
Commander Cody - Smoke, Smoke, Smoke;
Hawkwind - LSD (I've never actually heard this but...(g)).

<p>
Bullpen : (2 each - by fiat from the Editor)
Ramones - I Wanna be Sedated; J. Richman - Roadrunner;
James Brown - I Feel Good;
Sam Cooke - Twistin the Night Away;
Aretha Franklin - Respect (not Chain of Fools).

<p>
Discussion Interruption: Our household has had a rule for the last 20 years
that ``Respect'' must be on each dance tape so I had to do a right-in there. If
I can claim the Ramones song should be using Drug votes, move it up there,
bump Ian Dury, and give a vote Public Enemy - Bring Tha Noize UNLESS
the Hawkwind song is pretty much undanceable in which case bump it instead
of Dury.
<i>((I made some executive decisions here to allow the write in and to
add a point from me, as it should have been on the list in the first place.
You couldn't give ANYTHING more than 2 votes in this last round, so I bumped
up your choices on that score.
I'll still take your write in for Mavis Staples, but it won't make the final list,
since I only give it the maximum of three with one vote from me.))</i>

<p>
That leaves me 5 votes in Bullpen. 
Here I'd like to write in Mavis Staples, ``You Will Be Moved'' from her
CD <i>The Voice</i>

<p>
...which seems to be out of print. I decided I'd better purchase a copy of
this and send it to you as a lobbying effort but I couldn't find one either
new or used. There are fully 4 songs on this that I consider worthy of
appearing on an all-time dance comp: ``You Will Be Moved,'' ``The Undertaker,''
``Kain't Turn Back,'' and ``A Man Called Jesus.'' A 5th, ``Melody Cool,'' also rates
highly and can also be found on Prince's hmmmm?...something or other. If I
can figure out this CD-R gizmo I could make a demo copy, I guess. Tempting
since it's unavailable. Maybe I could mail Mavis a five-er.

<p>
Greetings,

<p>
Saw a cool concert Sat. night. Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Bruce Hornsby,
David Lindley, Shawn Colvin, plus members from their various bands. About
10 people total playing on some of the songs. The songs that had a BUNCH of
people playing sounded a little sloppy, but hey, whaddya want?

<p>
I saw the Allman Brothers with Susan Tedeschi too at the same place (Concord
Pavilion). Susan Tedeschi was okay, not great. I really felt she held back.
Later on when she came on with the Allman Brothers for one song that
feeling was confirmed as she cut loose on that one song. Sigh. Oh well, I
think it would be good to see her as the lead act in a small club. But on
this night, she showed why she was the opening act and the Allman Brothers
showed why they were the lead act.

<p>
The Allman Brothers put on a terrific show. There were some times when
their guitarist for this tour, DEREK Trucks (NEPHEW of Butch, the DRUMMER),
was just mesmerizing. Gregg Allman plays a real Hammond B-3, with real
rotating speakers. After all this time, it's still hard to beat that sound.
And Dickey Betts is a damn fine guitarist in his own right. The visuals
were wonderfully low-tech; film rear-projected on a huge screen in the back
with a mirror to split it. Sometimes more film in the middle. Some computer
graphics but it appeared even that was filmed and mixed in with all the
other film. And it really worked.

<p>
Saw my favorite band recently too. The visuals for that were a nice
combination of low and high tech. Various neon signs scattered all around
and over the stage, with a computer system to coordinate everything. The
band did an outstanding job although they have recently lost their drummer,
who does not appear on their latest album. They played an excellent mix of
old and new songs, even going back to their very first EP (which never
appeared on CD; I have it on vinyl, and tape).

<p>
I disagree with you about large venues, assuming you include ampitheaters.
I LIKE ampitheaters a lot. The weather is moderate here and you can enjoy
it, and the sound is very clean without all the echos of an indoor show.
And all the smoke floats up and away, which is nice. Even stadiums can be
fun if the event is organized well. But if not, they can be a disaster. And
if a band is doing well, you just may not be able to see them at a small
venue. BTW, the name of my favorite band... R.E.M.
<i>((I was wondering about that.... confused me at first....))</i>

<p>
Votes: Basket Case (1), Lithium (1) [Surprise, Rick and I actually agree on
something!], Cumberland Blues (3), Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll (1), and In Between
Days (4). I gave this last one the most because I agree there ``ought" to be
a Cure song there. If it were up to me, it would probably be something like
``A Forest" but that's probably a little too esoteric  ;-)
<i>((Well, not for me, but you broke the ``last vote'' rule against having
more than 2 votes per song, so I gave these songs 2 points apiece.
``In Between Days'' is safely on the tape anyway, and you pulled some of these
other songs up more that way.))</i>

<p>
B-52s vote: Rock Lobster.

<p>
I hope I got that right. If I missed out on a bullpen vote let me know.

Re Rick Desper's comment about my looking bad, note
the date of my original message on the subject of the
Blue Jays. It was sent on the very day that the team
snapped its monumental winning streak. The plummet was
startling, but, on reflection, not totally unexpected.
I hereby resolve not to comment on a subject about
which I know so little!
<i>((Hey, we all do it!!!))</i>

<p>
Note, however, that I refrained from commenting on the
season-long progress of ``my" team in the English (and
Welsh) cricket competition. Surrey won the county
championship by a margin which almost defies belief. A
team of promise for some years, the unique(?) position
in which domestic cricketers find themselves during
the season has mitigated against a strong Surrey
performance. Unlike other sports where national and
international commitments do not interfere with the
day-to-day domestic play, county teams suffer by the
unavailability of selected players during Test matches
which are played concurrently with the county
championship. Thus, with Surrey providing the lion's
share of players for the past four years, an unfair
burden was placed on the remainder of the team for key
matches. This season, the combined effects of a Test
schedule which did not clash as much as usual and
stunning performances from second-string players led
to a record which reduced the other counties to mere
also-rans.
<i>((Hey, cool, the same problem occurs in soccer/football
to you/ both over here and over there.
It is a VERY strange concept to Americans, I will tell you
straight out....))</i>

your readership.

<p><br><p><br><b>Chris Trent (October 1, 1999)</b>

<p>
Jim- 
Two things, first is a response to Rick Desper's comments about the fan apathy 
in Oakland and the second is about my interest in publishing my own 'zine. 
Rick Desper commented on the pitiful fan appearance during the A's playoff race 
against the Red Sox. First of all, those of us here in Northen California are 
confused too but I think it's not nearly as big a shock to us. 
Oakland is not really a huge city (but it does have plenty of peopie 
living outside its limits) and it's also not the richest city around. 
(Again, the richies live don't live in the city.) However, that's not really 
a good excuse. Even when the A's were on the top of MLB at the end of the 80's, 
fans were difficult to coax into the Coliseum and as soon as their might 
began to slip the fans ditched them. Why?
 
<p>
1) Why go to Oakland when you can go to San Francisco? The Oakland/Alameda 
Sports Complex (which is also where the NBA's Warriors play) is in an infamously 
dangerous part of town. They've tried to alleviate this to some extent but they'll 
never get past the fact that they're in Oakland and just a $3.00 toll away 
is San Francisco. Since many Bay Area sports spectators aren't from the Bay Area 
they'd rather make a day of it in the City than a possible mugging of it at 
the Coliseum. 

<p>
2) Al Davis. He is the owner of the Raiders. He brought the Silver and Black 
back to Oakland only when the City Council agreed to bend to his every whim. 
(He teased Sacramento to gain leverage against Oakland. ) His biggest whim 
was putting up bleachers and boxes behind the outfield, thus, as my friend 
explained-I'm not the biggest baseball fan-cutting off the Coliseum's wind 
and turning it from a pitcher friendly park to a very hitter friendly park, 
frustrating and alienating a lot of fans.
<i>((Usually, these things work in reverse.
Fenway Park did something similar over and behind home plate which turned
Fenway into a much LESS hitter friendly park.
This annoys fans, but I don't see where fans these days ``like'' pitching.
The A's have a great hitting team, which is popular these days.
Sounds like sour grapes to me.))</i>
 
<p>
It should be noted that the Raiders haven't done so well either until 
this year when they're playoff prospects. (I believe the last two Raiders 
games not blacked out were both against the 9ers.) Are Oakland fans fickle? 
Possibly. It is pretty much agreed that the Bay Area is over-saturated with 
sports almost as badly as L.A. because there's just too many other things to 
do with your time and money than go to a game. Only the teams that provide 
the highest quality get the attention. The A's advertising campaign at the 
start of this season revolved around all the great teams you could see 
play at the Coliseum. Will the A's pick it up next season? Not likely. 
They'll have to terrorize the league and clinch the pennant in September 
and then MAYBE they'll get 8,000 to show up. 

<p>
For you -Bob, as I said, I'm interested in starting my own 'zine. What 
I'd like to know is how to handle international subscriptions if I get them. 
Am I correct that you're in charge of the monetary exchange? If I get the 
international interest, what do I need with you to take care of changing 
the money? 
<i>((Nothing, you just have Brit subbers send their money to John Harrington
and then I send the money to you.
It really is very painless.
Anyone who wants help in understanding this, PLEASE ask!))</i>
Besides the monetary exchange I'm also just putting out feelers. 
Is there a market for a new 'zine? 
<i>((My personal opinion is ``yes'', but some of you want to encourage Chris??))</i>
I'm pretty certain that it will be a small 'zine with at least some decoration 
<i>((Unlike MY quite ugly szine....))</i>
and editorial stuff. Sometimes I think warehouses are a bit dull. 
If you think there's any room for another 'zine would you please advertise 
for my first game. Just have them send any inquiries to my addresses but I've 
changed my e-mail address to chrisimaus98 of hotmail.com - and I'll see who bites.

<p><br><p><br><b>John Harrington (Wed, 13 Oct 1999 02:14:16)</b>

<p>
Incidentally I am (almost) entirely confident that Logie-Baird was the
first to invent television, although as with the telephone (invented by
another Scotsman) there were probably other inventors on the verge of
perfecting the device when Logie-Baird patented his.
<i>((I'm sure you are right, but I grew up near General Electric's
research headquarters where they always claimed a central role in TV's
development...))</i>

<p>
On the subject of inventions and inventors not getting the credit they
deserve, I was reading on the Internet the other day (the Motley Fool's
UK site, as it happens) about Thomas Crapper, and how he gets little
credit in the USA for his invention of the ``water closet" - i.e. the
flushing toilet.
<i>((This is simply and absolutely NOT true.
Johnny Carson, among others, LOVED to tell the story of Thomas Crapper,
though he was from Oklahoma....
I've known this fact since I was a little, little kid, even before I
started to watch Johnny Carson on TV.))</i>

<p>
Technically speaking he did not invent the first flushing toilet, that
was a bloke called Sir John Harrington (no relation!) but Crapper
perfected it and the loo remains pretty much unchanged in design to this
day.  I can't remember exactly what was special about Crapper's version
of what we in Britain refer to as ``the bog" (or the loo, the karzi) but
I think it involved a valve of some sort - prior to Crapper I think
toilets had permanently flushing water.
<i>((You are supposed to be able to illustrate the effect of his valve
by pouring a bucket of water into a toilet and seeing what happens.
It is supposed to surprise you.... but I have no idea what that ``surprise''
is.
I'm sure someone will enlighten both of us.))</i>

<p>
Apparently many people in the USA believe Thomas Crapper to be an urban
myth, presumably on the basis that the name is just a bit too
convenient, just as one would be suspicious if the aspirin were
formulated by Arnold Headache.  
<i>((If so, it probably was because it was such a favorite joke
between Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon on the Tonight Show.
People probably thought that because that was where they heard it,
Carson was pulling their leg.))</i>
I have no idea whether the term ``crap"
was in existence before Thomas Crapper achieved his fame or whether his
name led to the coining of the term, but there is documentary evidence
(from an old London phone book) that a plumbing &amp; sanitation company
named Thos. Crapper did exist in the latter half of the last century.

<p>
Fascinating stuff, eh?  If you really want to open a can of worms you
could debate who invented the computer?  I think Britain and the USA
both have very valid claims, depending on what counts as a computer.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I am open to suggestions on the latter, though I want to print maps and
***I*** don't know how to make the rings rotate easily.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Stephen Agar claims the Borg and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this soon.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of that refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

<p>
1) The Spring deadline has been pushed back to the 20th!
Despite the comments from some on how slow this is, I don't
have all that many advance orders.
Once we get going, the game will move.... well, Fall won't be due
until after Christmas, but it will move a little faster after that.

<p>
2) I have some press for this deadline, see below.

<p>
3) Some asked about the NMR insurance.
Your NMR insurance balance is in parentheses up above.
If you fail to get moves in by the deadline, I try to contact you and
charge you a dollar off the balance.
When the balance gets to zero (unless you ante up more money) I don't
contact you and you will NMR if you don't get moves in.
If you don't have an NMR balance, I still will E-Mail you if you
don't have orders in as long as I have an E-Mail address for you.

<p>
4) I have named the game after a Mekons song that seemed particularly
appropriate, don't you think??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY - WORLD): I do have e-mail, honest!  I came up
with the clever address of dwayneshreve of yahoo.com and
I use it.  

<p>
(ITALY to ALL): Bernie told me to take Scandinavia while he wraps up the
eastern problem.

<p>
(ENGLAND to GM): Who or what is/are the Mekons?
(Pardon my ignorance of this musical group.)
<i>((None taken.
They are not the most well known group around, though they have been
playing together for over 20 years.
They started in England in the wake of the Sex Pistols along with
other essential groups of the late 1970's such as the Gang of Four.
The lineup has migrated around quite a bit over the years and
I have been a huge fan since about 1981.
I call them the greatest rock band and the world and I
do mean it seriously.
What I mean by it is that they take on the classic attitude
and politics of rock music, which essentially is lost everywhere else.
They don't care if they ever ``make it'' in the classic sense and
they've never really made any money.
They also have made practically every kind of music you can imagine over
those 20 years, so relatively few people except fanatics like me
like virtually everything they have done.))</i>

<p>
(ITALY to FRANCE): Have you figured out who everyone is yet???

<p>
(LONDON, FEB. 1, 1901): In this winter of discontent and amid 
rumors of war, Prime Minister John Beale rose in Parliament to 
declare, ``The Government of Great Britain declares its intent
to see the balance of power maintained in Europe.
Let no nation violate the borders of any sovereign power."
The leader of his majesty's loyal opposition immediately
rose to reply, ``I call for the Prime Minister's resignation.
How can he stand before Parliament to say England will stand
aside from the fray?
We demand decisive action."

<p>
(ITALY to BOOB): You do always manage to follow in my footsteps.

<p>
(BOOB to ITALY): And you in mine....

<p>
(ITALY to MOM'S LITTLE BROTHER (A TRULY OLD AND OBSCURE REFERENCE): Hey,
this doesn't mean I'm not going to DO it!

<p>
(SIX GOOD SOLDIERS to THE WORLD (people not actually in this game and
Buddy)): Ve vas only following orders. (Shouted by six players who heel
click smartly at the end of the sentence.)

<p>
(A LITTLE MONASTERY): A sign over the door announces, rather simply, ``Home
Of The Brethren Who Receive Divine Guidance After A Vow of Silence To The
Most Correct, Humble, Tactically Correct, Semantically Inspirational Saint
Bernard (not the breed of dog) of Baskerville (also having nothing to do
with dogs or hounds)."
        
<p>
Around the table, at their evening meal, six hooded monks sit at their
supper.  Several of the brothers are quite gray, two are younger, one a
mere stripling.
        
<p>
None looks at another, for there is no communication necessary.  All
guidance, all inspiration, all news, all comic strips, actually all
communication any soul could desire are theirs at need.  They are the
dedicated ears of the Bernardists.
        
<p>
But some struggle seems to be occurring within one of the members of the
order.  He seems to struggle with muscles that have been forgotten.  He
starts to rise and finally manages to mutter, in a weak croak, ``I am the
favored one!  I have been given my orders through the Fall of 1901!!!"
        
<p>
A shocked look goes around the group and another begins to struggle to
make sound and finally succeeds, ``Heresy!  I am favored above you, my
orders are plain before me through the Spring of 1902!  St. Bernard (if
this had any thing at all to do with dogs there would probably be tacos
somewhere near) favors ME!"
        
<p>
All at once they are all standing and trying to cry out after years of
silence, each claiming to be the favored one, the one to receive the most
extensive set of orders, membership in the sacred three-way, until finally
one voice quiets all the others with the pronouncement, ``He has sworn a
game long alliance once I give him all my dots!"
        
<p>
At once the others sit down, mutely, with tears in their eyes.  Truly the
final speaker is the chosen one, nearest to the right hand of the Uncle of
All Saints.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Just as a point of information, Bob Acheson had been away from home
in Virginia on business recently, but he is returning home now.

<p>
2) Stan Johnson had moved.  Note his new address above.
Also I have an E-Mail address for Karl Schuetz.

<p>
3) Most importantly, I have dropped Heath Gardner from the game,
he essentially missed two deadlines as I have been calling and
E-Mailing repeatedly over the last three weeks.
Replacing him is an experienced Colonia player, David Partridge,
who already is playing with many of you in the other game
being GMed by Michael Lowrey.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(NOUVEAU SPAIN - BOOB): What is this?  You send me a last minute note
looking for orders, so I pull out the szine and figure I'll read the
press to get a feel for the game.  There is NO press for the first
fall.  Not even a snide comment from the GM!  Who's running this
game anyway?

<p>
(RUSSIA to CHINA): No no no no no!  You can't just walk into a space
bordering mine without a group of officious looking men sitting 
around a table and discussing it (making threats, whatever) first.  
That's the diplomatic way.
<i>((Some ***could*** say the reverse!))</i>

<p>
Spain - all:  No chance to write, I got this at the last minute.  All
previous bets are off, see your local bookie for a refund.  The embassies
are open (and serving donuts!), drop in and spin us a yarn.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Stan Johnson slipped in with orders just in time, which I decided to 
write in on the szines of the affected players.
Note his address change.
Stan does take over as Germany as a result.

<p>
2) Notice that Chris Trent has changed his E-Mail address and is 
inquiring for interest in playing a new Diplomacy game in a 
new szine he is thinking of starting.
See the letter column above for more details.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(F-G): I'm forming a line, no war is declared.

<p>
(JOHNNY MUSTAFA to THE GREAT RUSSIAN CZAR): ``The Sultan has instructed 
me to address you. He apologizes for `inappropriate acquisitions 
of the past,' and wishes to make amends with the great Czar. 
Your port is to be returned to 
you. May the light of the Sultan warm the hearts of his neighbors." 

<p>
(MOS-VIE): If Russia's so cold and desolate how come 
everyone seems to want a chunk of it? 

<p>
(DR. VINNIE GOOMBA-T): With all those woman, The Sultan needs 
some anti VD cream fresh from Rome. 
I will be glad to come deliver it.

<p>
(ITA-AUS): Hey!
I took my best shot against a silent neighbor and got the most dots 
for my money.
Besides, I've fought 4 and 5 front wars and surprised a few in my day.

<p>
(TRAVEL BROCHURE): In Rome you can see many museum masterpieces 
and maybe meet the Pope... 
hmm does the Pope still have a standing army?

<p>
(ITA-FRA): I don't want <i>no</i> trouble, but that fleet looks
like I might get some regardless.
Well, here goes again.
Let's get it on.
   
<p>
(GERMANY): I desire peace with England <i>and/or</i>
France; but I must take precautions till I see who
my friends are.
                                                  
<p>
(F-G): Welcome, hope agreements stand.
  
<p>
(MOS-ANK): Alright, alright... so you've pillaged our vacation 
homes and raped our mistresses. At least you have decent taste... 

<p>
(TURKISH SEA CAPT. to RUSSIAN PEOPLE): ``Errrr.... umm......WELL!  
Sorry about that! 
We in the Navy will miss the childish cries from the boiler rooms of 
our ships!"

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note Richard Weiss' new postal address!

<p>
2) Though Heath NMRed, this game does not allow for replacements.
Heath will continue to play with his nukes unfired and his units
unmoved.
He can, of course, win in absentia, but you guys wouldn't let that
happen, would you? ;-)
I, of course, really hope Heath returns!!!

<p>
3) Everyone looked like they ``agreed'' on moves this time.
No one went for anyone else's home centers, and only Greece
was left neutral.
The game remains REALLY close, with Jody and Mike leapfrogging into
the lead, but everyone is still in the game.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(SARA-GM): As far as I can tell from spending one coffee break on
the problem, the most black holes that can be traversed
by one unit is 17, such as Austria's Army Bohemia-
Tyrolia-Venice-Apulia-Ionian Sea-Naples-Tyrrhenian Sea-
Rome-Tuscany-Piedmont-Marseilles-Gulf of Lyon-Spain-
Portugal-Mid Atlantic Ocean-Brest-Paris-Picardy to wind up in Belgium.

<p>
(DR. LAURA - MISANTHROPIC MIKEY): Few would intimate that a true MD would 
be ``bodacious," much less use the phrase while describing one.  Much as the 
thinking through the concept that every answer you give is a lie, including 
whether or not you lie, blows the minds of the galaxies' collective 
computers and created the post-conscious epoch, so does the actual usage of 
``bodacious" to describe the little charleton behind the Great Leader of 
Italy's curtain.  A brief analysis of the rest of the epistle, points to an 
m.o. well known to listeners of this show - a quoter of lyrics, a 
barnomobile expert and a diatriber without a tribe.  Once again I must 
remind you to take accountability for your actions - otherwise you will be 
grounded without use of electronics outside of your bedroom for 67 days.  
and your usual collection of magazines with the stuck together pages from 
your masturbation will be tossed.
   
<p>
(MIKE to RICHARD):  Everybody has different tastes.  I prefer women who
are themselves:  I'm not grabbed by a bleach job on the hair, a paint
job on the face, or silicone cantaloupes on the chest.  If a woman is
kind, cares about me, and is in the mood to share pleasure, then
whatever size and shape she is will be ``perfect".  Even in a strip bar,
I find attitude a more significant turn-on factor than breast size, and
unmodified women more attractive than augmented ones.  The only reasons
I have heard for breast add-ins (from women firsthand) are for
``normalness" after cancer surgery, and to be in higher demand as a
showgirl.  Usually the latter reason is not ``to please men" but ``to have
more power over men" or ``to make more money".

<p>
(JIM-BOB to MIKE AND RICHARD): Maybe we need Dr. Laura to help us sort this
out....

<p>
(DR. LAURA - JIM-BOB): Given your long history of self-abuse, yes, I will 
use the correct diagnostic term, ``Saddam-Masochism" why would any of the 
participants expect you to change behavior for this game?  They wouldn't.  
They are fools to believe otherwise.  I wish I had a dollar for every fool 
that calls this show.

<p>
(JIM-BOOB to DR. LAURA): Hello???  Why are they giving you a buck???

<p>
(DR. LAURA - GERMANY): You are the leader.  Raise your head proudly and 
await the next bomb drop.  To expect other than less from the males in this 
group is to be in fantasy-land.  They bombed the last pregnant leader, do 
not provide child-support, you are not married to them, and duh, like why 
would you expect them to not bomb on you.

<p>
(MIKE'S SECRET OF LIFE IS): Don't mix too much uranium in with the
nitric acid.

<p>
(DR. LAURA - ITALY): I understand that you have a moral dilemma.  You have 
explained it well.  You can either write press you enjoy and nuke those who 
squirm the loudest, or you can try to win.  Let me ask you again, ``How do 
you define winning?"

<p>
(ENGLAND to FLUBMASTER):  Note that Norwegian Sea, UNLIKE North Sea,
borders Clyde!

<p>
(SARA-JOHN): See, I let you have Bulgaria as thanks for your helping
me out in Spring 1903.  Much appreciated.  And thank you for your cute 
letter of 21 September.

<p>
(JOHN-SARA): You're welcome, thank you very much!

<p>
(MIKE to CHAOS PRODUCERS):  Aw, I don't have access across any big
black-hole zones.  Guess I could jump Skagerrak to take Kiel but it's
not better than this non-aggressive move to Belgium.  Conventional moves
are boring but they're what I've got.

<p>
(RUSSIA to AUSTRIA): On questions of war and peace there is a 
societal imperative for caution, but it must
be understood that ambivalence is not 
synonymous with statesmanship and that 
anxietyship is no substitute for leadership.

<p>
(DR. LAURA - DR Z (RUSSIA)): I will see you in the winter palace soon.  
However, unless we are married first, do not expect to have any physical 
contact with me.
   
<p>
(SARA-HEATH): Do I really have to spank you again?

<p>
(JOHN-RICHARD): The main IDOC offices are less than 30 miles away but 
the radiation sickness is worth having watched the mushroom ascending
and pretty colours descending.

<p>
(DR. LAURA - TURKEY): You ambivalence as to which opponent to bomb makes 
you sick and has kept you repressed.  Face the fact that you are responsible 
for your own twisting and turning, and therefore for your own sickness and 
nausea.  Unite your underlying principles and values, pray, and then follow 
the path which enables you to give.  Do not think of the path which will get 
you the most, but rather the path that will allow you to give the most to 
others.

<p>
(JOHN-JODY): Well, I'm glad it wasn't you, as well.
But, it really doesn't matter who, only that Jim passed the
word and maybe one or two heard.
   
<p>
(DR. LAURA - PARISIANS): You are to insignificant to allow unto the radio 
show tonight.  Please call back another time.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Lots o' action, eh??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(AMBASSADOR KENT POLLARD to THE VARIOUS POWERS):
``Ve ar continuink ze polizy of globahl exzpanshon vhich shall
bring ORDER to a confuzed Europe!!  
Ve harbohr no ill vill to anyone exzcept zose who are agaiinst us!!  
Ze peace loving peeples ov my nation ar only
conczerned viss  zha vell beink ov all.
My government stresses to ze Various Powers/Hedds ov States the 
`We ar only followink the PRIME DIRECTIVE' "!!

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL JON RHODEHAMEL SPEAKING to THE COMMANDS OF THE 1ST,
3RD, AND 5TH ARMY GROUPS):  "Be happy that your actions are 
leading to a greater Union of all peoples.  
We will continue to move forward, penetrating
our enemies' lines, whereby all opposition 
shall be crushed!!..............
  
<p>
(HANS THE BEER MAKER): ``I intend to establish a new brewery in
Constantinople.  
!!FREE BEER!! WILL BE GIVEN AWAY FOR A DAY WHEN OUR TROOPS
PUSH THE FUZZY HEADED TURKS OUT!!!..........................

<p>
(ENGLAND to IRF): Can you say ``No Home Dots?"  I thought you could.  
No, you can fight over them.

<p>
(THE AUSTRIAN 3RD ARMY CORPS to THE RUSSIAN TROOPS HOLDING MOSCOW):
``Winter is coming!!  There is a time to fight and a time to flee!!  
We choose the latter. . . . . . . . .

<p>
(BARNO'S HAIR IS SECRETLY RUNNING THE COUNTRY!!):
<font face=symbol> &lt; </font
>AP DISPATCH<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
>
The CIA and FBI today raided Mike Barno's house in a joint operation.  It 
seem's Mike Barno's hair had been making inroads into the branches of power 
and legislative halls in Washington DC.  Mike Barno's hair has been linked to 
several embellezing shemes and to an assisination in Virgina.  Alan Greenspan 
has been linked to meetings with Mike Baro's hair and has been taped 
soliciting hair contributions from hi.

<p>
The Rogaine in Red fingered Mike Barno's hair outside a theater in downtown 
DC.  Upon being cornerd his hair lept from his head and landed on stage.  It 
was heard to have shouted ``We will not recede from tyranny" as it limped off  
the stage making a hasty exit.

<p>
Police were optomistic about locating the wayward folicles as Mike Barno's 
Hair suffered damage on it's escape leaving several patches of itself at the 
theater.  These bits of hair are being questioned.

<p>
If Mike Barno's hair is sighted PLEASE call police immidiatly.  It should be 
considered conditionless and dangerous.  If the police are unaviable the only 
think you can do is grab a bottle of Pantene and pray.
<i>((sic, very sic - I couldn't bring myself to clean up the spelling
errors....))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to KENT, RANDY ELLIS, and JIM-BOOB):  I survived the expedition to
Yellowstone with the obligatory Barnomobile breakdown not occurring
until I was 100 miles from Binghamton.  On Saturday night, the state
police dispatcher gave me the phone number of a garage which is NOT OPEN
on Saturday nights or Sundays.  So Jeff Bohner fetched me and I spent
92 for a 23-mile tow and eventually 300 to replace the ignition
control module.  The GM dealer locked my keys in the car so it wouldn't
get stolen from the back lot, but my spare keys were still in my camping
backpack locked in the trunk.  So I had to break into my own car - used
a curtain rod to push the lock lever.  Heckuva trip, though, very
worthwhile.  Didn't hike and camp as much as I hoped but did some and
one roll of decent pictures.  Watched some geysers, camped alone at
Grebe Lake, saw some wildlife, renewed many old friendships.  Almost
camped at the campground near Yankee Jim Canyon where a pair of renegade
shooters had just wrecked their car and fled up the mountainside.
Highway Patrol and deputies and rangers were searching the steep, rocky,
brushy terrain in pitch dark; they finally caught the kids (19 and 16)
the next day around noon.

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE):  The Austrians don't have bad breath, they have bad
alcohol abuse problems among the impotent figurehead "monarch" and the
out-of-control general staff.  Among your motoring industry people are
talking of horseless-carriage accidents caused by drunk drivers....
Think of the Austro-Hungarian activity as a "policy crash" in a similar
fashion.  Team momentum was foolishly thrown away, swapped for a
short-time individual gain followed by years of isolation, siege, and
eventual destruction, fated to die alone because of discarding allies
far too soon.

<p>
(PALACE OF LIGHT AND FIEROS to ADVENTURER WRAPPED IN THE HOLY ANCIENT
GLORY OF ROME):  The commendation and gratitude of the Ottoman Empire
are publicly extended to the Italian government and people in
recognition of the excellent accommodations that were provided to our
ambassador during his recent trade mission.  The free scenic vista was
outstanding.  [One question arose, though:  Why were no in-room
masseuses provided?]

<p>
(NO REMISSION WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD):  Cries of ``Le sacrifice
humain!" are heard from the somber crowds surrounding the Pollard
mansion.

<p>
(ROME-IBERIA): While your try for Tunis is forgivable given your
desperation, it
really wasn't very bright:  you chose that move, with a low percentage
chance of
success, over covering WMS and slowing the English encirclement of your
enclave.  Oh, and thank you.  I didn't really want to move out of Ionian
anyway....

<p>
(TURKEY to FRANCE): Welcome to the No Gotta Dotta club.  Let's see if we
can last longer than they think we will.  This is turning out to be a
real Hermit reunion, isn't it?

<p>
(GERMANY to ITALY): Oh yeah.  NOW you tell me.

<p>
(EMMERT to JAMES): I think a big part of the reason why college baseball
isn't as popular as, say, college football is exactly the reason you
cite:  There isn't any minor league football.  The best baseball and
football players in the country are in MLB and the NFL.  The second-best
football players in the country are in college, or out of organized
football (I don't count arena football, though maybe I should).  The
second-best baseball players are in AAA ball.  I don't think that's the
sole reason for the lack of popularity of college baseball, but it's one
reason.

<p>
(GOZ to DREW): I really don't have a good answer on your college baseball
question.  Lack of TV coverage?

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE):  You see, there are only two places to get
deep, analytical discussions of the business and philosophy of baseball.
One is The Sporting News, and the other is the So Good report.  Next
month:  ``The Tyranny of the Players' Union:  Can the American League
Dump the DH?"

<p>
(TURK to HAPSBURG):  That Nostradamus guy was right.  You're next.  Italy
and Russia have been partners since the gamestart was announced, and you
and I are caught in the middle of it.  Whichever of us survives the
intial elimination will be their next victim.

<p>
(TURK to TSAR AND POPE):  Would either of you gentlemen care to confirm
what I have advised the Hapsburg, or are you going to deny it in an
attempt to deceive us?

<p>
(GOZ to NOSTRADAMUS):  Why don't you give us something worthwhile next time?
How about the winners at Belmont?

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): Cheers!  Good to see you this weekend!

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): No offense, but I want the old France back.  It is hard
to gloat to someone who isn't responsible for their situation. 

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD):  I took my daughter (age 5) to her first hockey
game last night, Sept. 28 - Capitals-Hurricanes in Norfolk.  One of the
Caps got a two-minute minor in the first period, and she asked why he
was going over to that box.  I explained the concept of penalties and
the penalty box, and that the Caps would play one short for a while.
After a moment, she turned to me and said, "Daddy, how long does he have
to stay in Time Out?"

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) David Partridge, 
John Schultz, Tom Howell, Harry Andruschak,
Eric Brosius, and John Harrington will be in the new game here.
I have orders from everyone except John Schultz.
Get 'em in next time, John!!
Then the new game will begin, just about the same time as this one ends.
We'll be playing Version 2.3 of the rules as published a few issues back.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DATELINE DALLAS): Today the Cowboys announced that they had solved last
year's problems in training camp drills.  ``They've
practiced the roadside sobriety test until it's 
second nature by now."

<p>
(HOLLYWOOD BLACK PRESS): Harry Andruschak has been signed up to appear in
two porno films whilst wearing his kilt, SHEEP
THROAT and BEHIND THE GREEN PASTURE GATE.

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO., QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO.,
INC.):  Profits up $18M this quarter, just in time to pay corporate taxes on
them.  The CEO's 7-year-old niece, who has been calling the shots lately,
has demanded a doubling of her allowance and stock options.  We sent her to
bed without supper, but not until after getting her thoughts on orders for
this turn, since she's done much better than her recent predecessors.

<p>
(LATEST FROM VEGAS):
For those of you who are not really paying attention, this is
actually an extremely close race.  Who can stop Cottontail
from taking 2nd?  Nobody, that's who!  And then if Mopsy or
Flopsy gets third, the bunnies are only one point behind Chef's
Crackers!

<p>
On the other side, looks like the Flat Wheel Society is about to
have two more riders dropped.  Our bookies may be forced to make
a payment to the Goz Transportation Co. to cover this bet - 
but the odds were low and thankfully the cash-strapped GTC didn't
have much to wager with.  

<p>
(JOHN BOY): Ha!
Does it really matter?
                           
<p>
(PLAUTUS-BOOB): VIN IAM FACIUM, UT STULTIVIDUM ESSE TU TE FATEARE?
``Shall I force you to admit to yourself that you have
all the foresight of a fathead?

<p>
(TFWS-DESIGNER): This is a fun little game.
Damned shame it took me so long to figure out what was goin' on.

<p>
(TFWS-BOOB): Whole lotta barkin' goin' on-ha!-yeah-that's
a good one, boss!!

<p>
(ROUND 2): The fight's outcome isn't final until both boxers pass the
drug tests.  One wonders if the USA is the only country in 
the world that has higher standards for its boxers then for  
its presidential candidates.
   
<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): OK, I am going to try and send my moves 
and press on floppy disk.  I assume a
super-duper computer whiz kid like you can handle a very simple ASCII                               
test file?.  Otherwise...

<p>
(JIM-BOB to HARRY): Yes, we got it JUST fine; however, change of plan.
I bought a super-duper computer whiz scanner more than worthy of a
super-duper computer whiz kid like me (actually, it was Charlotte
who really needed it) and it scans in letters really well.
So, just after starting it, let's bag that idea!

<p>
(MERCATOR PLAUTUS-BOOB): Ad mandata claudus caecus mutus mancus debilis.
``When it comes to following orders you're a lame,
blind, mute, maimed wreck of a man."

<p>
(DOCTOR SHACK YE QUACK SEZ): I note that Dan Quayle has announced that he 
is quitting the presidential race.  I really
do feel sorry for the guy.  It is indeed a sad situation when you have
Donald Trump running for president, Warren Beatty running for president,
Pat Buchanan running for president, and Dan Quayle is still considered 
the dumb one.
     
<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-RICHARD WEISS): Your memory is failing you again.  The
NYEED game you were thinking of over in
``Saddam Hussein" did not have a round where we all agreed not to attack
with nukes for one round.  This was in the older one-shot version of 
NYEED, and the ``Peace On Earth" plan called for a careful targeting of
the 34 nukes on the 34 SCs, resulting in 0 SCs for all players, resulting
in a 7-way win.  Mark Lew broke ranks and finished dead last as a result,
and he also spoiled the joke.  That's the problem with kids nowadays, no
sense of humor.
    
<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-JIM BURGESS): On 15 June I tried out the local library's
internet access computers.  As you can 
read from the enclosed sheet, this internet access is not for e-mail, 
newsgroups, ``chat", or ftp.  It is mostly for the WWW.  And most of the
time the computers have hoards of students on the waitlist.  I was 
finally able to get an hour alloted, and you will be thrilled to know 
that I was able to access the Diplomatic Pouch.  After that I went book 
shopping at amazon.com and was cheered to find that one of my favourite 
guide books had come out with a new 1998 edition, although I could not 
order it from the library connection.  (Ordered it from Borders Books 
after several other book chains refused to order it for me.)  My main 
impression after one hour on the WWW was ``too many graphics".  Animation 
all over the place.  Banners, advertisements, and I don't know what else.  
How was a guy supposed to R*E*A*D anything with all this fuss going on?  
Grumble grumble grumble...
    
<p>
(GOZ to EVERYONE):  Ok, will someone now please kill Cottontail?

<p>
(TFWS NEWSLETTER): Discussion could be heard among members regarding
rumours that there might actually be (shhhh-round wheels).
One Barkin' Larkin' was clearly quoted as stating, ``Naaaaah-can't be.''
The rest were in total agreement.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-COUCH POTATOES): Since my return from China, I have had several 
letters and phone calls from concerned family and friends about ``getting out 
of China in time" to avoid the demonstrations in the wake of the USA's bombing 
of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

<p>
Gee folks, thanks very much, and I do appreciate your concern, but like
Mark Twain's death the news was not reliable.  Now this is not to say
that the Chinese are not angry with the US Governemnt.  However, the
average Chinese citizen knows full well that the actions of a government
do not reflect the opinions of its citizens.  China has had 7,000 years 
of civilization and none of it has been democratic.

<p>
One has to remember that China wants to join the World Trade 
Organization, but is asking for certain concessions.  The USA has an
axe to grind over the human rights issue, such as Tiananmin Square.
This explains the posturing poo-poo of the State Department's travel
advisory for China.  
    
<p>
My own advice and opinion would be to ignore all that stuff and go to
China.  I'd go again if I had the time and money.  Just stay away from
the area of the embassy and you will be just fine.  You will find the
Chinese to be friendly and understanding.  Your main problem will be with
the vendors and sellers.  Remember, never pay more then $1 for 10 
postcards, $3 for a t-shirt, and bargain for everything else.  You can
usually get 40% off whatever the asking price is, so bargain.  
    
<p>
I've also been asked about the food, such as if we ate dog and cat and 
so on.  

<p>
Background:  I eat and enjoy haggis.  I note that most americans (but not
me) eat lots of spam, hot dogs and Big Macs.  So why the qualms about 
other foods?  "Now it's chicken that I cannot eat, because it tastes like
rattlesnake meat".

<p>
Here is the information.  Most of China does not eat cat, dog, snake,
monkey brains, or any other exotic meats.  Most of the time it is beef,
pork, chicken, duck, and fish.  How did this idea of eating dog get
around?
    
<p>
China has many regions, each with its own distinctive cuisine.  One small 
region is Guangzhou, which westerners continue to mispronounce as 
``Canton".  And THIS small region is the one with the omnivores.  Here
you can indeed eat all that other stuff.  And the truth is that the rest 
of China tends to disdain the Cantonese.  ``The Cantonese will eat 
anything that flys except a kite, anything with 4 legs except the table
and chairs, and anything in the water except a boat."  This is NOT 
intended as a compliment.

<p>
For reasons of history, it was mostly the Chinese of Canton who, in
the 18th and 19th centuries, spread around the world.  They opened
restaurants and for many westerners it was Cantonese cuisine that came to
be known as ``authentic" Chinese cuisine.
    
<p>
Friends, do not worry.  The tourist restaurants will never serve you the
exotic stuff.  It is also against the law in Hong Kong.  In most of
China you will get authentic cuisine of the region and it will be beef,
pork, chicken, duck, and fish.  
    
<p>
About the closest our tour group got to exotic was in Shanghai, where 
we had authentic Mongolian Bar-B-Q.  Mongolian Bar-B-Q is now widespread 
in the USA, so you know the drill.  The Shanghai version served beef, 
pork, chicken, and goat.  The goat meat was just about the only exotic 
meat our tour group had in China.  Interestingly enough, I was the only
member of our tour group to eat the goat meat, 3 bowls of it.  Yum yum.

<p>
During our tour group's stay in Guangzhou, we did indeed stroll through
the famous QINGPING MARKET, the heart of the city, and we saw it all.
Yes, the cats and dogs and snakes and all the rest of it, waiting to be 
bought, cooked, and eaten.  Snakes are sold at so much per 500 grams, and
the cost varies according to species of snake.  It would be idle to deny 
that some of the party were upset at seeing the cute little kittens,
knowing what was going to happen to them.

<p>
However, the exotic foodstuff is only part of the market.  Aside from the
flowers and birds (some to be pets, some to be eaten, some both), there
was a wide variety of items used in Chinese folk medicine.  Dried bats,
dried seahorses, dried and fresh this and that.  I asked about the 
seahorses, and the ever-friendly Chinese informed me that they were 
cooked in a broth to be given to babies and small children.  Chinese folk
medicine is a thriving business, especially in Guangzhou.

<p>
I suppose I should reassure all those who are thinking about a trip to
China that if you really insist on it, you can find Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and McDonalds in every Chinese city, and more and more American
fast food franchises are showing up.  
    
<p>
Needless to say, I didn't insist.  I paid good money to come to China 
and I wanted nothing but authentic Chinese food and I got it.  Day after 
day, meal after meal, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I pigged out, 
stuffing myself.  Did YOUR mother ever try to get you to eat the spinach 
by telling you to ``remember all the starving children in China"?  I 
remembered.  I over-indulged.  If any child starved in China last April, 
it was not my fault.  As a result, I came back five pounds...lighter.  
Even my Doctor found this hard to believe, but that is what the scales 
in her office showed.
    
<p>
Authentic Chinese cooking is very low fat cooking, except for a few items 
like Beijing Duck.  We also did a lot of walking for exercise, such as 
climbing the Great Wall or walking up the many many steps of the many 
pagodas and temples.  I guess that helped to burn off some extra 
calories.  I always used chopsticks.  Forks are for wimps.

(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``The temptation on the street;
Is more than any saint could stand; I have to bite my tongue;
And keep on walking straight ahead; You have got to draw the
line between;  What you want and what you need.''
From ``Fantastic Voyage'', a song on <i>So Good It Hurts</i>
and the source of the game name for the new game at the top
of the Games Section.

<p>
(LON-ROM): Here we go, you must be a Republican - telling
me what my moral obligation is.
Besides, rarely is the moral thing to do the most fun thing to do.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-JEFF O'DONNELL): ``For years I've regarded Richard 
Nixon's very existence as a monument 
to all the rancid genes and broken chromosomes that corrupt the 
possibilities of the American Dream; he was a foul caricature of 
himself, a man with no soul, no inner convictions, with the integrity 
of a hyena, and the style of a poison toad."  

<p>
(BRI-SPA): Good job, Sean.

The Russian concession is reproposed.
Please vote with your fall orders.

<p>
(TSAR to BRIT): Cannon to the right of you, cannon to the left of you.
Volleys of shot and shell.
Into the jaws of death, into the mouth of Hell.
Run away, brave 600!
<i>((Very cool, is that from the Charge of the Light Brigade???
I hope I read your handwriting correctly.
Your handwriting CANNOT be interpreted by the new scanner...))</i>

<p>
(TSAR to GOD-KING EMPEROR KURTUKAWA OZOGSAN): You have shown 
yourself honorable, indeed.
How next may we serve your spirited Royalness in the war against
the imperial lackeys?

<p>
(TSAR to DUTCH UNCLE): Come home, Rick, and all will be forgiven.
There is still time to save yourself.

<p>
(ODESSA to SULTAN):  Really - is this how you meant it to end?
Not with a bang, but a ``zzzzzzzzz''?
This I expect from Langley, not you.
Onward and upward!

<p>
(F-R): I will hold as long as I can.

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): Roland, your struggle is valiant and we
support you and are in your corner always,....
geesh, Burgess, am I sounding more and more like Flash all the
time or what?
Gimme the news.
Doc Boob, is there a cure?

<p>
(BOOB to DUCK): Total isolation from ALL Fazzian influences for
THREE years of hard labor, that should do it.

<p>
(SANTA CLARITA to PROVIDENCE): Hmmm, better ``Doc Boob'' than 
``Boob Doc'', eh?
<i>((I'm not completely sure.....))</i>

<p>
(F-B and H):  Ah the memories of old alliances.  

<p>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE): Sorry.... we just voted ``Oui''.
