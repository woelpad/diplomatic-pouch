<br /><br />I had a great trip to Barcelona, which is in CATALONIA, not Spain, and now am back.
Unfortunately, too much traveling around and I won't make World DipCon in a few weeks.
I hope everyone going has a great time.
I didn't get the last issue out before I left, but now we should be on track for 
the rest of the summer.
And as soon as this goes in the mail, I'll finish putting <i>Diplomacy World</i> #94
together and get that out.
Tim Haffey has had some health problems, but he's doing better now.
For those of you who get <i>Diplomacy World</i> postally, there was a miscommunication
about mailing out #93, and David Partridge is just getting that out now too.

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.

I'm going to continue putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, 
working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
Derek Nelson is the person who won the first postal game in
<i>Graustark</i>.
He's been missing for at least 25 years, I know in the records I can
find that he attended the 1976 DipCon in Baltimore.
I think it will be fun if we can find these Golden Agers.
So, let's really find Derek, it's worth fifty bucks!!!
You have until issue #295 at the fifty buck price.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target

<br /><br /><b>Mark D Lew (Fri, 1 Jul 2005 18:43:57 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A's are hot again.  Who'd have thunk it.
At the beginning of the season, several of us said that we'd finish the 
first half at about .500 and then make our run for the playoffs during 
the second half - the typical pattern for the A's over the past few 
years.  Now, amazingly, it looks like we actually could finish the 
first half at .500.  Half a season is 81 games.  When we lost our 39th 
on June 17, it seemed impossible, but we've only lost one more since 
then, so it could still happen.
Billy Beane says that the A's will be "both buyers and sellers" for the 
trade season, and I believe it.  The usual dichotomy of contending vs 
rebuilding doesn't match the A's philosophy.  Beane always works to 
stay competitive year after year, rather than the pattern of occasional 
years of greatness separated by long periods of hibernation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think Kotsay is more likely to go than not.  He's a good player and 
we like him, but he fits the pattern.  It's not that he's overvalued 
per se, it's that he's worth more to other teams than he is to us.  If 
someone offers us something that's worth more to the team than Kotsay 
is, then we take it.  Of all our outfielders, he's the only one who's 
good at CF (Charles Thomas isn't hitting well, and all the others are 
weak defensively), but we are a little overpopulated at outfield at the 
ML level, so it's a relatively easy void to fill.  Losing Kotsay will 
only make us slightly less good right now, so if another trade makes an 
equal improvement in right-now competitiveness, it works out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other place I think we sell is at bullpen.  Beane loaded up with 
bullpen talent during preseason, presumably because he thought bullpen 
was underpriced.  Through our rash of injuries in May, you couldn't see 
it, but now that they're all coming back we've got more good bullpen 
arms than we need, so I could see him trading one.  I'd guess Rincon as 
the most likely to go, since he's older and more valued by 
right-now-minded teams than our younger guys are.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, the conventional wisdom, even nationally, is coming around 
to the view that the A's won big on the Mulder trade.  That's earlier 
than expected, since it was a trade for the long term.  The Hudson one 
hasn't looked so good so farl, but I think it will ultimately turn out 
looking like a good move, too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just got through telling Jason B to keep Mulder on his Stratomatic team. 
For a guy his age making a league change, he actually hasn't struggled as 
much as I expected; I think by the middle of next season he'll be back to his 
previous performance high point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This spring, I correctly predicted every aspect of the NL West, and called 
the AL West and NL Central pretty well, but I didn't see the others so 
clearly. I thought the White Sox would be contending for the wild card, not 
blowing away their division; and I expected the Orioles and Rays to be .400 
teams with Toronto being the weakest in the AL East. I though somebody would 
beat Atlanta this year, but I expected that to be the Mets or Marlins.

<br /><br /><b>Mark D Lew (Sun, 3 Jul 2005 13:26:25 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I haven't actually followed Mulder much since he moved away.  It seems 
entirely possible to me that it could have been a good move for both 
teams.  A trade doesn't have to be a zero sum game.  Given the A's 
resources and goals, I think both trades make sense for them even if, 
eg, Dan Meyer doesn't turn out to be as good as Hudson is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For A's fans the big question about Mulder is why he had such an 
enormous slump at the end of last year?  Could it be just a fluke?  
They never really identified a semi-injury or psychological issue that 
caused it, so you have to wonder:  what was it, and is it something 
that could happen again?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The only division I called was the AL West, and I said the A's would 
squeak it out with about 85 games in a close race for a weak division.  A 
month ago that looked extremely unlikely.  Now it looks like it could 
happen if: (a) The A's play reasonably well for the rest of the season, 
(b) the Rangers decline a bit for the rest of the season, and (c) 
something happens to the Angels, possibly a key injury, that knocks 
them back in a big way.
Right now I'd guess the odds of those at about 80% each for (a) and 
(b), and maybe about 30% for (c).  So that adds up to about a 20% 
chance that I called it right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I still think that there's something about Mulder that we haven't 
seen yet, I don't follow every start, but it does not look to me
like he's one of the top 10 pitchers in baseball any more, which
is what he was before last season's season ending slump.  Until
I see it explained, I'd be a bit wary, though he surely is not
anywhere near being a bum.
I've been pretty much on track with most teams, except I thought
Bonds would come back sooner and that the Giants and Padres would
battle there (still could happen!), I missed the White Sox entirely,
but in retrospect it is clearly Ozzie.  A lot of very respected people
thought he would be horrible!  The main knock (as I understand it,
this is not unique to me but what I was hearing) is that he would be
"too aggressive", just as he was a horrid basestealer with terrible
judgment when he was a player.  BUT, with a filter between him and
playing field, i.e. as a manager, he seems near perfect.  The White
Sox are aggressive in a good way.  The good basestealers are brilliant.
The fielding and baserunning in general are great.  And he's handling
the pitchers really well.  They and Ozzie are there to stay.  I
predicted most of the other divisions pretty well, though I also
missed the Nationals.  Again, a great manager, Frank Robinson, is
playing without the constraints previously upon him (the deathtrap
that was Montreal).
We'll see how things play out.  If the Red Sox getting Schilling back
rights the whole pitching ship by shifting everyone down a role (Ace on 
down), then the Red Sox will run away with the second half.  If they
can stop playing the Blue Jays.... they always have one eastern team
that they just can't beat each season.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Whoops, turns out I was wrong about Kotsay.  If I had to call it one 
way or another, I'd have said he'd be gone.  I figured the final straw 
would be the no-trade clause.  Kotsay sounded determined to get one, 
and until now Billy Beane had never given a no-trade clause to anybody. 
Having the flexibility to trade is too much part of his business plan, 
so he doesn't like to give that away.  That was the real reason we 
didn't re-sign Giambi.  A few players (including Chavez) had gotten a 
list of a few specific teams they couldn't be traded to, but never an 
agreement not to trade him at all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's obviously what the negotiations with Kotsay's agent were about, 
since the money he was asking for wasn't excessive.  The compromise 
they came up with is that Kotsay has a complete no-trade for 2006 (his 
second child is due in about three weeks) and a limited no-trade for 07 
and 08.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still say we've got to move an outfielder or two.  Now I'd guess 
about 40% that either we don't get Jay Payton after all or we move him 
again shortly after getting him; about 25% that Byrnes is traded, and 
about 25% that we trade some other outfielder.  The remaining 10% is 
that we actually hang on to them all, but if so that's probably only if

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P.S.  Whoops, there it goes.  While I was looking for the link to cite 
this, I stumbled upon the next trade story - Byrnes and Quintanilla to 
Colorado for Joe Kennedy and Jay Witasick.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So after all the rumors, Byrnes finally moves.  That makes room for 
Payton - sort of.  He's still one of four outfielders filling three 
spots. Actually more like three filling two spots, since Kotsay is 
going to play almost every day.  But I guess it's still better than 
being behind Manny, Johnny Damon, and Trot Nixon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Witasick more or less fills the spot vacated by Bradford, so when all 
is said and done we swap one outfielder for another, one reliever for 
another, and a maybe infield prospect for a maybe veteran pitcher.  For 
a while, Quintanilla was supposed to be one of our hot prospects, but 
in the past year or two he's plateaued and it's questionable whether 
he'll be mediocre or a AAAA type player.  Anyway, he plays SS, and 
we've got Crosby there; then there was talk of moving him to 2B, but 
now that Ellis has recovered reasonably well and Scutaro continues to 
do better than he "should", we don't really have room there, so it made 
sense to move Quintanilla, since now is the right time to put him in 
the majors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With Bradford and Byrnes gone, there are now only two current A's who 
were members of the 01 team:  Zito and Chavez.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect that reaction from the hard-core fans in Oakland will be 
fairly supportive of moving Byrnes.  Those who dislike him are glad to 
see him go.  Those who do like him don't like the way he's been treated 
here and think he deserves to play full-time somewhere, which 
presumably he'll do in Colorado.  (And he'll have more opportunities to 
play the Giants, against whom he has a freakishly successful record.  
Small sample size, no doubt, but still a fun fact.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The fans were mostly negative about moving Bradford.  He's well-liked, 
and I don't think many take into account that he might not be the same. 
If he stinks in Boston, everyone will come around.  If he's good 
again, then they'll all complain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Moving Quintanilla makes good sense.  We don't need yet another guy 
rotting in AAA when he's ready to play in the bigs.  Not sure what 
we'll do with Kennedy.  There's been talk (acquiring Kennedy had been 
rumored before) that maybe Kennedy goes into the rotation and Saarloos 
goes to the bullpen.  Saarloos has been surprisingly good as a starter 
- I think he's the best ERA on our staff, after Harden who after his 
injury doesn't have enough innings to qualify in the rankings - but 
there are indications that the management views him like they view 
Duchscherer, another guy they moved from starter to flexible long 
relief.  Saarloos is a sinkerball pitcher who could be particular good 
at getting double-plays, something the A's used Bradford for (and Tam 
before that).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Saarloos is like Scutaro in that he's someone who was perceived as only 
an emergency backup who nevertheless managed to scrap his way into 
games.  Last year he subbed for Hudson during Hudson's injury and did 
pretty well, but as soon as Hudson returned they sent him back down.  
This year at spring training, he wasn't expected to even make the team. 
Then he got the last bullpen spot.  Then when Harden went down, he 
went into the rotation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm babbling now.  I know way too much about this team.  Now I'm 
starting to build up some history of it even.  I realized that when I 
mentioned Tam, who hasn't been around since, what, 2000?
<i>((Oh no, I think Jeff Tam was last on the A's in 2002, at least
that's what I remember, wasn't he in a relief tandem thing with Jim Mecir 
that year??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Awesome performance by Rich Harden in the first A's game of the second 
half, at home against Texas.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It was a perfect game through 7 1/3 innings.  ESPN cut to live coverage 
of the game for the 8th inning.  Blalock was out on one pitch, but then 
Soriano got a base hit - barely 20 seconds after ESPN cut in.  The 
fans on Athletics Nation blamed ESPN for "jinxing" the perfect game.  
In the 9th inning he gave up a second hit (Dellucci).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even without the no-hitter it was still amazing.  Complete game 
two-hitter.  Eight strike-outs, no walks.  Total of 81 pitches, of 
which 61 were strikes.  Lowest pitch count for a complete game in A's 
history since they started recording pitch counts (whenever that 
was...).  Hudson and Mulder each had an 86.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And that's against TEXAS.  Whatever other problems the Rangers may 
have, that's a damn good hitting lineup.

Yeah, I was toggling between the Dodgers game (vs. Giants) and Harden in the 
7th and 8th. His 8th was really amazing: one-pitch groundout to first, then 
three Texas Leaguers (the one that dropped just beyond the reach of 2B Ellis 
and two that he caught going out). Then he had a couple of 
called-third-strike Ks in the 9th where he looked even more unhittable than 
he had earlier. Sweet stuff even if you don't care either way about either 
team, which is pretty much where I am with the AL West these days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Damn Giants are up 4-3 in the top of the 9th in L.A.

Boo, Giants!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The sweetest Harden AB was at the end of the seventh.  He had gone 2-0 
against Teixeira, which I think was his worst count so far in the game. 
Then he got called for an "automatic ball" because he touched his 
fingers to his mouth while he was still on the rubber, which made it 
3-0.  So then he comes back with a 99 mph fastball that goes right past 
Teixeira, then a 97 mph fastball that he fouls off, and then gets his 
to ground-out.  It was brutal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, Harden actually threw only 80 pitches, not 81.  The 81 
includes the automatic ball, which evidently counts toward his official 
pitch count, even though he never actually threw it.
The pitch count stat began in 1988.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some really nice defense by Ellis, and Chavez's HR was a straight-arrow 
that some fans said was the fastest they'd ever seen a ball leave the 
park.

<i>((Also, just being curious, it looks like a great series of classic
small deals by Billy..... is Jay Payton going to be your regular
right fielder?  What do we need to know/be worried about about
Chad Bradford.... ;-)  ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Just saw the PS on the other message, I've been in Europe for the
last week and a half and not reading E-Mail.  I returned to watching
the Red Sox implode last night against the Yankees.  But it was an
exciting game....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark D Lew (Fri, 15 Jul 2005 18:02:28 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On Classic small deals:))</i>
That's my feeling.  None of this changes the team a whole lot, but it's 
marginal tweaking in a positive direction.  Payton takes the place of 
Byrnes, and Witasick takes the place of Bradford.  In both cases, 
there's enough uncertainty that it could be an upgrade or a downgrade, 
but the net probability is a slight plus.  Those are a wash, and the 
money is roughly a wash, so what's left is we traded Quintanilla for 
Kennedy.  Q is a minor-leaguer who may or may not become a regular 
major leaguer, but we've got no room for him.  Kennedy is a fixer-upper 
project; the hope is that he could become something good, but if he 
doesn't, we get a little bit of relief pitching out of him now and then 
dump him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((On Jay Payton as starting RF:))</i>
No.  Assuming that we don't flip him to another team, he'll be the 
fourth outfielder here, too.   But he'll get a lot more playing time 
here than he did behind your trifecta.  Kotsay will be almost-everyday 
at CF.  Rookie Nick Swisher is the regular RF; Billy likes him to get 
lots of playing time, but he'll get occasional days off and he also 
subs at 1B sometimes.  Kielty is our regular LF now, but he'll get days 
off, too.  Payton will be the backup for all three spots and get 
rotated in for starts every now and then.  Kielty is a switch-hitter, 
but he's far better vs LH than vs RH (as was Byrnes), so there'll be a 
bit of platooning and late-game pinch-hitting there.  Also Payton is 
better defensively that Swisher or Kielty, so he could be a defensive 
replacement.  (Swisher is actually quite good defensively at 1B, but 
we're overloaded in that position, so Swish is pushed out to RF where 
his defense is mediocre.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've also got flexibility with the DH spot, for as long as Durazo is 
away.  Hatteberg has been DHing a lot now, as the new kid (Dan Johnson) 
is phased in as regular 1B.  But sometimes the DH spot is used to get 
another outfielder in instead.  About a week ago we even played Kendall 
as DH - first time in his career - in order to get Adam Melhuse a 
rare start, so that he doesn't forget how to catch.  Hatteberg was 
potentially available as a backup catcher if needed, but it probably 
wasn't a coincidence that this happened on a day when the starting 
pitcher was Danny Haren, who is a pretty good hitter.  If for some 
reason Melhuse had to be taken out, they might well have moved Kendall 
from DH to C and just let the pitcher hit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((What's up with Bradford?))</i>
The main thing to worry about is that he just came back from major back 
surgery.  Sometimes guys come right back from that; sometimes they're 
not the same again.  We don't really know how it will be with Bradford. 
That uncertainty was understood by both GMs and was discounted in the 
trade calculation.
Also, although Bradford was still decent in 2004, he wasn't nearly as 
good as he was in 03 and 02, when he was arguably our best reliever, so 
it's possible he was already declining before his injury.  It also 
might be that he became less effective as hitters around the league got 
used to his weird delivery, in which case his lengthy absence could be 
a plus.
When he was at his best, Bradford was nasty against RH hitters, who had 
trouble seeing his stuff.  LH hitters tended to do much better against 
him.  He did, however, have the ability to go a few innings, which we 
liked to take advantage of, so that prevented him from becoming 
strictly a RH specialist.
His odd delivery has the ball coming up toward the strike zone, almost 
like an underhand pitch. That means he gets a lot of groundballs.  He 
was particularly good for getting double plays, and he was one of the 
best in the league at not giving up HRs.
He does have a couple of other pitches, but mostly he relies on his 
fastball and good control to put it on the corners.  Because of the 
angle of delivery, the hitter doesn't see it as quickly, so the 
fastball seems even faster than it is (especially for RH hitters).
But the main thing is how the injury affected him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Don't know if anyone cares at this point, but I got an update on Harden:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(The sweetest Harden AB was at the end of the seventh.  He had gone 2-0 
against Teixeira, which I think was his worst count so far in the 
game.  Then he got called for an "automatic ball" because he touched 
his fingers to his mouth while he was still on the rubber, which made 
it 3-0.  So then he comes back with a 99 mph fastball that goes right 
past Teixeira, then a 97 mph fastball that he fouls off, and then gets 
his to ground-out.  It was brutal.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I got these numbers wrong.  The post-automatic ball pitches were 98 mph 
(strike looking), 99 mph (fouled off), and 90 mph (change-up! ground 
out).
In the post-game interview, Harden mentioned the automatic ball and 
acknowledged it was a good call.  He wasn't trying anything funny - 
just that he usually steps off the rubber for that but by chance this 
time he forgot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He also mentioned the way that Texas deliberately stalled in the 7th 
inning, dragging out their pitching changes and an injury time out in 
hopes of messing with Harden.  He said it as if he did believe the 
delaying was intentional, but he accepted it as a legitimate part of 
the game for which his proper response was simply to stay focused and 
loose and not let it get to him (which I think is exactly right).

Zito for us, Wasdin for them.  I think Wasdin sucks, right?  Zito is

(CAPTAIN'S LOG): "I don't have a clue" and neither does anyone else, except the Romulans.
First the Romulans, the Tribbles, and the Children of Tomari attack the Breen.
Now the Breen failed to retaliate against a vulnerable Romulan Starbase and in 
their infinite wisdom they attack what's left of the Klingons.
The Klingons re-took Kronos <i>((or Qo'noS in proper Klingon.... I do try to correct
your Star Trek spelling wherever I can....))</i> with the help (of all people) the Romulans.
As a result, the Breen have one less Starbase and one more enemy; the Klingons.
The Children of Tomari helped the Tribbles take a Breen Starbase then failed to defend it
as the Breen averted total disaster by taking it back.
The Tribbles attacked us, putting themselves totally out of position to defend
themselves against the Breen.
As a result, the Breen were able to walk into one of the Tribbles' home worlds.
We did retake Deep Space 6 from the Tribbles, but I played it safe by 
not attacking a Tribble Starbase near the Tribble solar system.
They didn't defend it, and they did not attack Deep Space 5 like I thought they
would.
We could have walked into the Tribbles' undefended Starbase and that would have forced
them to sue for peace.
I screwed up and we may never recover because I played it safe.
The thing is, it's not in my nature to play it safe.
To make matters worse, the Romulans have now occupied 2/3 of the Ferengi
neutral zone.
They are in position to devastate our forces if they choose to.
They are claiming that they are coming to our aid agains the Tribbles.
We will find out very soon what their intentions are.
I'm telling the locals to learn how to speak Romulan.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Conversation between Kirk (K) and Dr. McCoy (M):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(K): Any luck figuring a way to change us back into human form?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(M): Yes and I've made a discovery.
Even though we have been changed into Ferengi, we still ahve a human
DNA signature.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(K): Really!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(M): It gets better, when we were fighting the perpendicular universe
Federation we took some prisoners that needed medical attention before
we repatriated them back to the Federation.
I still have their medical records.
Our presence here didn't just turn us into Ferengi, it
turned the perpendicular Ferengi into humans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(K): They haven't given any indication that they are aware of it..

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(M): They may not be.
The Genesis device that brought us here had a temporal signature in its
Genesis matrix (I have no idea what I'm talking about!!! ...)
That signature may have gone back into time and changed 
their entire history into human, not just the present time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(K): Can you, Spock, and 7 of 9 recreate that Genesis device
to reverse the process?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(M): It's possible?....

1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is now well ahead of this pace and is set to win
easily).
It looks like we end for sure next time, send me orders or comments if
you want to.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPRINGFIELD): The guys from Moe's tavern are waiting at the finish line.  Barney
just belched.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RICK to JIM-BOB):
As for the C's...do you like the draft?  This kid Green is apparently
a possible phenom.  We'll see...I remember Joe Johnson, Chauncey
Billups,...wait, they both had great careers after leaving the C's. 
Maybe Jefferson and Green can do the same while staying in Boston.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to RICK): I also like picking up Ryan Gomes with the C's second round pick,
he'll make the regular rotation before Green, the first round pick will.
Gomes gets LOTS of playing time if they don't sign Antoine, which is assured
unless Antoine takes a HUGE paycut.
