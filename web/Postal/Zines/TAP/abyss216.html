<p><br><p><br> ``Hi! crackpot lamebrain." is an anagram of ``Michael Patrick Barno".
Submitted by Michael Patrick Barno his self.
Now, the question is, is he saying that to all of us or are we saying
it to him!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Through some herculean efforts on my part, this szine is more or
less on time, especially to the players.
See one apology to the postal mailers in the Music Section below.
I still don't have everything in here that I wanted, so I'm 
still holding some things, but we're slowly getting caught up.
Luckily for all of you, the next deadline comes after tax day.
I don't have mine done yet, so I have to get this out the door
so I can do that!!

<p>
More generally, I have to apologize to nearly everyone for the mess
of the way that the last issue went out by mail.
I have a very cheap ``do-it-myself'' copying deal that allows me
5 cents per double sided page (equivalent to 2.5 cents per page
just about anywhere else).
This is GREAT when it works, but when machines break down, either
completely or just in the stapler (some people may notice that I hand
stapled your last issue) it becomes a big problem.
I did some copies of the last issue at that higher ``twice the price''
rate but I really couldn't afford to do all the issues that way.
Everyone went into a priority list hopper and I mailed them as
soon as I could.
I don't like to do things that way, and hope I won't have to again.
The priority was basically first to players who had no E-Mail/Web
access, then to other players, then to subbers, then to traders,
and then to other assorted hangers-on.
I made the web version available earlier than I usually do, a day or
two after I made the very first mailings, but the rest of the issues
took as long as a week and a half after that to get out.
Thanks for the understanding messages I received (a lot of them
this month) asking how I possibly keep this monster up and going in general.

<p>
<b>THE DEADLINE FOR <i>TINAMOU</i> IS APRIL 11TH</b>

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
I'm not going to start any more new games (other than the Star Trek
game) until some games end.

<p>
the szine resides in html format.  
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually 
in the near future.

<p>
The most recent issue also can be accessed through David Wang's
and Pete Sullivan's web pages:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
His ``version'' of this szine is somewhat more html.friendly
than the one I created, so please check it out.
David Wang's site also allows you to follow John Caruso's postal

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR BERNIE OAKLYN</center><br></b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Bernie is still the feature here until issue #220, but in the interim
someone else has found themselves.
It has been a long and winding road, but Bruce Geryk has finally dug
himself out of whatever holes he's been crawling around in and come
back to claim his lifetime subscription!
Not only that, but equally shadowy (but rumored to be living somewhere
in suburban New Hampshire) partner in crimes against humanity
Jeff Zarse has also surfaced.
More from Bruce and Z below.....
but I should be upfront and state that these two used to be referred
to as ``The Bad Boys of Diplomacy".
For those unfamiliar with them, you'll get a hint below.
I don't care about the rest of you, I love these guys and their
perspective, so they'll stick around here to some degree.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p><br><p><br><b>Bruce Geryk (Wed, 17 Mar 1999 18:28:40 -0600)</b>

<p>
Jim, Jim, Jim,

<p>
So you're handing out ``lifetime subscriptions" to people like Stafford, eh?  Is
this anything like the ``lifetime subscription" I got when you first started your
zine?  
<i>((Precisely related, in fact nearly the same!))</i>
As I recall, I won the right to receive your misguided music musings for
as long as I existed by answering some question about <i>TAP</i>, 
like where you got the name.  How quickly we forget.  
<i>((Does anyone except for you still remember this??
Luckily for you, I remember.))</i>
Looks like you owe me about 200 back issues.
Let's have 'em.
<i>((You don't want 'em all at once, so you'll take them as I give them
to you....))</i>

<p>
``Makes Bruce Geryk look like Dale Carnegie?"  Oh please.

<p>

<center>Bruce, ceremony of net66.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork, yes, we still say that.))</i>

<p>
Apparently.

<p>
<i>((So, everyone, I was tracked down through doing a search
on Bruce Geryk and since all these issues are indexed in these search systems
he found this quote from issue 195 or so.
Anyway, welcome back, and to address the quote, yes, it is difficult, but
some things can be so bad that they CAN make you look like Dale Carnegie.
How come you didn't include your postal address with this note, though,
you loser!
How am I supposed to mail you issues without an address???))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Bruce Geryk (Fri, 19 Mar 1999 11:34:09 -0600)</b>

<p>
I'm ``such a loser in this" that I didn't just send my postal address out to some
(s)zine guy after accidentally finding him on the Internet?  Boy, that would
have been wise.  You been working at Los Alamos these past years?  ``Hey,
Burgess, there's some guy with a Chinese accent on the phone saying he left the
plans for the hydrogen bomb triggers on his desk and would like you to just drop
them in the mail c/o the Chinese Embassy."  ``Hey, sure, no problem."
<i>((Why not?
Being trusting is good, being trusty is risky, being a risk taker is bliss!!))</i>

<p>
Ways you can make fun of this (helpful hints):

<p>
1.  Bruce thinks his address is as important as U.S. nuclear secrets.
<i>((I know, I know, I need help.
Your address is pointless information.
What I am blasting you about is asking for something without providing
the means to deliver it.
Sure, I'll take some hydrogen bomb triggers....))</i>

<p>
2.  Bruce thinks Jim is Chinese.  (A complete non sequitur, but those are often
good in humor situations.)
<i>((But you KNOW that I'm just clueless on being funny.
I'm a total loser.
You said so yourself.))</i>

<p>
Actually, a friend found your page and sent me a message containing the URL and
the question, ``Who is `Jim Burgess.'"  It's sort of scary that even before
following the link, I had a pretty good idea what I would find.
<i>((Indeed.))</i>

<p>
<i>((Well, yes, I looked up ``Bruce Geryk" on the search engines and found a
huge amount of stuff by a Bruce Geryk reviewing computer games (is that
you too?).))</i>
 
<p>
That's me.  I write a variety of computer game reviews and columns for a 
couple sites.
I justify it to myself with the fact that (a) it keeps me buried in free games,
and (b) as a med student AND a graduate student, it's a paid job that 
I can do during the only hours I ever have free:  between midnight and 3am.  
I do end up using some of that money on hardware
upgrade after hardware upgrade, though, in 
order to be able to run the latest stuff.
A search for me would have been trivially easy.  Good thing I saved you the
money.
<i>((Not your postal address....))</i>

<p>
So I have to read your back issues on the web?  Some ``lifetime subscription"
this is.  I expect individually mailed copies of each issue with handwritten
apologies for each and every misguided music opinion you expressed therein.
Flipping through your 1998 issues, I didn't see a single mention of either of
the two best releases of last year:  Kristen Hersh's <i>Strange Angels</i> or The
Beautiful South's <i>Quench.</i>  Of course, if you know Tanya Donelly's father,
you're probably part of some bizarre anti-Hersh cabal.  
<i>((I do like Donelly better than Hersh, but that's a good record.
Kristen has not had good luck live on the road promoting it, though,
it's gotten terrible reviews - the new one, <b>Sky Motel</b>, is supposed
to be MUCH better but won't be released in the US until summer.
I didn't go when they hit Providence.))</i>
And since (as I recall)
you were a Housemartins fan, you're probably bitter that Paul Heaton isn't just
re-recording the five hundredth new version of ``Flag Day."  But that's you.
<i>((No, I have gotten over the Housemartins as a frivolous fling.
I still love the Close Lobsters, though!))</i>

<p>

<center>For my address, see my .sig, Bruce Geryk, ***CENSORED - TRIPLE TOP SECRET***</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Were you to read what is beneath that censored info I would
have to kill you.
Sorry.
May be revealed on a need-to-know basis.
Anyway, since the search engines have found my szine I've been getting all
sorts of hits like this.  Interesting.))</i>

<p>
Probably a secret surveillance program run by Alan Stewart.
<i>((Hey, we're going to have to search for him next!  That will be fun.
By the way, I still have all sorts of misguided musical opinions.  
Mekons forever!!!))</i>
 
<p>
Here's a question I recently snuck into a gaming column.  
Who was better:Paul ``The Jam" Weller or Paul ``Style Council" Weller?  
Or Peter Weller?

<p>
<i>((Peter Weller, who??
The Jam Weller, no contest.  From the sheer fun of ``Girl on the Phone"
to the great cover of ``Love is Like a Heat Wave" to the perfection of
``Absolute Beginners" to the poignancy of ``Town Called Malice" there
was great depth and variety.  The Style Council Weller was all Flash
and no Dash.
Remember, I still love the Close Lobsters.
``Skyscrapers of St. Mirin" is still heavenly!!))</i>

<p>
I still listen to <i>Foxheads...</i>  
Unfortunately, <i>Headache Rhetoric</i> was lame and I gave up
on them after that. 
<i>((Agreed, agreed, agreed.... it even gave me a headache.))</i>

<p>

<center>-B, ceremony of net66.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Next the Boob gets confused...
I send Geryk: ``Bombs for YOUR mailbox.  I've published this address 
in all the usual places.  
You noticed (when you read that issue of the szine) that Chris
Carrier has died.  With him all the real bad karma went with him.  Even
you are no longer capable of launching any Great Feuds.''

You are confused - I don't want your back issues.  You've mistaken me with
some maladusto-Dale-Carnegie-wanna-be.  I just wanted you to know that I'm
not at all impressed that Tanya Donelly's father is your plumber - I've had
Tom Donnelly washing my car and mowing my yard regularly since '92.

Got this from Zarse the other day.  Boy, you ARE confused.  Why would
I sign my name ``Z?"  
<i>((I dunno... how am I supposed to fathom the depths of your
mind and what you might do or pass to others....))</i>
This was a message from Jeff, who chose to reveal
himself for God knows what reason.  Guess you now can't have a search
for him, either.  Oh well.

<p>
I'm not out to start any new feuds.  That would be a colossal waste of
my time, considering that I have so little free time these days as it
is.  My feeling is that people who spend too much time on things like
postal Diplomacy (or computer games, or stamp collecting, or whatever)
KNOW they spend too much time on it, and pointing it out to them only
makes them defensive.  It's impossible to convince them that they are
maladjustites - they have to figure it out for themselves.  Some
never do.  Carrier was an extreme case, but I suspect there are far
more people like him in the hobby than you will admit.  They may not
be as abrasive or disturbed, but they're there.

<p>
Since I'm writing, I might as well give you yet ANOTHER music pointer
(I'm charging for these, so you'll be receiving an invoice from me
later):  Frank Black and the Catholics.  Steve Clark got me the first
FB solo album as a gift almost exactly six years ago.  Little did I
know I'd have to wait five years for another album from Mr. Pixie that
would be as good as the debut.  This album is superb.  Frank Black is
a twisted individual.

<p>
Oh, I got the (s)zine in the mail the other day.  Glad to see the Post
Office still works.  Glad to see your handwriting hasn't changed.

A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what

toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas

they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?

<p>

so I'm going to quote the whole rant in case someone lost it in the H thread.
<i>((I did, so I even missed who wrote it!!))</i>

<p>
<p>
<center><b>OFF TOPIC RANT</center><br></b>

<p>
I can see that you are in the know about the U2 suit.  With all due respect I
have to disagree about the infringement.  The following rant is not aimed at
you.  It's just a rant.  Indeed, Negativland is doing much better.
 
<p>
All records by Negativland are stunts (well, the O.T.E. tapes and CDs are
compilations of their free-form radio broadcasts, which happen to be the
longest running free-form radio program in broadcast history.  The first two
records `Points' and `Big 10-8 Place' [one of my desert island discs] are more
simple found sound sculptures).  They are media assassins.  Negativland takes
it upon themself to expose the dark side of media, and try and do it with a
tounge in their cheek.  The Brohm Murder fiasco (documented on `Helter Stupid')
is a prime example.

<p>
Just because Negativland likes to insite hostility from their media victims
does not mean that the judicial system, or mega-companies, have the right to
legislate based on personal bias.  Do they deserve to get some grief for their
efforts?  Yup, and they will tell you so, but being in debt for the rest of
their career, and having their art destroyed is not fair by any stretch.
Having a brick thrown through their window in Contra Costa for the Brohm Murder
fiasco, with a death threat attached to it, is fair enough.  Forsaking record
sales for honesty is fair enough.
 
<p>
I have the U2 single and I believe that Negativland DID NOT infringe on a
copyright.  Island threw $350,000 at the Negativland suit.  The reason why they
didn't back down is they wanted to recoup their losses, so they used the
copyright infringement issue, and marketplace confusion, as the base to keep
the suit rolling.  SST records, Greg Ginn (dink), Negativland, David Wills,
Mark Holsler, Chris Grigg, and Seeland MediaMedia were all named in the suit.
Greg Ginn made an agreement with Negativland that SST records would defend the
suit for all parties named (stupid on the part of Negativland), and then
promptly caved.  SST caved to ALL the demands of Island, and turned around and
sued Nagativland for $400,000+.  SST won the suit (obviously) and now own in
perpetuity all of the records made for SST.  FOREVER!  They demanded two new
records and a few O.T.E tapes as well.  Negativland had a CD in the can, and
the tapes were already in the SST offices.  So, on top of everything else,
Negativland, owing $400,000+, having their art destroyed, and suffering from
stress-related health issues, were forced to make another record for SST.  Greg
Ginn was also kind enough to remind Negativland of the ``Metal Machine Music'
suit leveled against Lou Reed.  Real nice guy.
 
<p>
The reason why they were found to be in violation of copyright was because SST
and Greg Ginn accepted the terms of the Island suit.
 
<p>
And the fact that Negativland is so paranoid about suits that they have to code
the name of the <i>DISPEPSI</i> record is just sad.  Negativland had teeth, and now
they are forced to Jam underground.  You have to call David's house to get the
name of the record!  BTW, Jody is right, <i>DISPEPSI</i> is a great record.
 
<p>
Andre' Serrano, Lou Reed, Mark McGuinness, Negativland, Sonic Youth, Gilbert
and George, Dinosaur Jr., G. P. Orridge, Jam Ham Radio, S.R.L., G.G. Allen, and
a host of others, all victims of rediculous ideals supported by big business
and silly laws.
 
<p>
<i>((Of course, you all heard about <b>Dispepsi</b> first in <b>TAP</b>!
As soon as it came out, I was on it.
And it is a great record.
Anyway, now to Jody's comments....))</i>

<p>
I believe what you say is pretty accurate here. But I think you're saying
that Negativland could have beat the suit if it had actually gone to court,
and I don't agree with that. They might have gotten the damages lowered,
which would be a kind of victory, but I think that they still would have lost.

<p>
It's true that SST sold them out, big time, and that's one of the uglier
stories to come out of the record industry. And there's plenty of others.
Take John Fogerty, for example. Bad stuff has been going on a long time.

<p>
But anyway, I'm not really talking about the way things SHOULD be. If
I was, I'd agree with you and say Island should never have been able to
try to *DESTROY* a band like that. What I'm saying is: the way the laws
are, they DID infringe a copyright. And unfortunately, Island decided
to get out the BIG hammer. They could have just called them up and said
``Hey, we think you shouldn't have done that, and you should pull those
off the shelf right away" and you can bet they would have.

<p>
Anyway, sad story, and one I hope more people will get familiar with.

Commentary for inclusion:
Nice note from Dan Stafford.  But short in the extreme.  I will prompt him 
a tad.
I actually read most of the szine this issue.  I always save it to file and 
then cut out the stuff not directly related to my games or of interest to 
me specifically.  I then work orders, press and what not from a hard copy. 
I managed to get it down to three pages this time.  But I read more than I 
usually do, although I always catch bits and pieces.
Typically I read stuff from people I know or who I have seen write well in 
the past.  Most of what you had (and you did say you held back a bunch due 
to time constraints) was very good.
<i>((Did you read the stuff from Geryk and Zarse this issue??))</i>
It seems that there is an awful lot going on here at the Casa de Toad right 
now and never enough time to do all the fun stuff.  But then it seems like 
all I do is fun stuff, so more accurately I guess would be to say I don't 
get all the fun stuff done.  And the rest of it goes to hell.
<i>((Great comment.
I am there!))</i>

I have gotten into the ebay, online auction big time.  Over the last six 
weeks I have sold about $1500 worth the Magic:The Dustgathering.  And of 
course I have bought about $1500 worth the knives of various sorts.
I have always had a small, nondescript collection of knives.  On ebay there 
are four or five thousand knives up for auction at any given time (might be 
a much larger number, not sure).
But the bottom line is that it is a real time burner.  I will keep playing 
as long as I can keep making money on their to the extent I spend it.
And it is a lot like a game.  You are competing for limited resources with 
your OWN limited resources.  And who ever gets the most toys WINS of 
course.

<p>
We have five pregnant mares and one is due momentarily.  We have been 
checking every couple of hours for two days now.
We sold an expensive baby this month, which is a corner I was wondering if 
we were ever going to turn.  For awhile we had fifteen horses.  Then we 
sold one last fall.
Now we have one more sold and interest in a couple more.  But we need to 
get down to maybe a half dozen or so over the next year.  We peaked a 
little to soon.  Judy is still a year or so from retirement and I am about 
eight years short.  The property is too small for that much horse.  And 
neither one of us is too sprightly.  I look back two and a half years and 
remember moving in with just four horses (sigh).
Just had a lady call who bred to our second stallion and it didn't take. 
She hinted very broadly that she wanted all her money back.  The contract 
specifically says you get more breeding, not a refund.  Judy gave her back 
all but the booking fee, which is basically a reservation.  The woman was a 
little miffed but most breeders wouldn't have given her anything back.  And 
she bred to our horse because our fees are lower because our stallions are 
not well known yet.  There is a lot of yin and yang when a hobby becomes a 
business.

<p>
I enjoyed Keith's tales of choosing CD's for his kids.  My brother and his 
wife never did get over me buying their kids Zappa CD's.  They are both 
pretty loose but had trouble with the idea of Frank's lyrics for some 
reason.
Another area of interest for me on the net is Zappa stuff.  There are a 
handful of videos, primarily from his concerts in Europe, that are for 
auction on the net.  I have gotten one so far but they tend to go a little 
higher than I am will to spend on something so brief in terms of enjoyment.
I buy movie videos but usually after they have gone into the sale racks at 
the stores.  Only occasionally will I buy one new when it comes out.  I 
think the most recent one I actually bought ``fresh" was ``Toy Soldiers" and 
I knew I had little kids coming.  Nothing like a good, recent video to 
mesmerize the kids.
The Zappa video I got is called ``Video From Hell" which has several 
reasonably normal music videos, clips from the early years and excerpts 
from the hearings in the late 80's when Tipper Gore and friends wanted to 
put labels on any music they didn't like, if they couldn't just have it 
banned.
<i>((I actually disagree with you on that one, see the Mark Lew 
discussion below.))</i>
Frank really came off well and at the time he made good press.
There are magazines offered on ebay solely for the reason that they have 
interviews with Frank or articles on the hearings.  But then you can find 
stuff on just about anyone there.  I also sell Louis Lamour hard cover 
books there.  My grandmother left me nearly a hundred (sigh).

Hey there Jim.

<p>
I hope you aren't burning out on your zine. I really do look forward to seeing
it in the box every month. During my searches of other zines, your name pops
up time and again as the person keeping American Postal Diplomacy alive. Maybe
if your quick deadlines are starting to get a bit unmanageable, you could just
extend the deadlines to give yourself more time to get <i>TAP</i> together and
running. I seriously doubt anyone would hold it against you or even fuss about
it being a week longer between issues. Sometimes you have to cut yourself a
break.
<i>((Perhaps, but if I let things slip, it will just get worse.

<center>NOTICE OF INTENT TO DISPOSE OF THE DIPLOMACY ARCHIVES</center><br>

<p>
<p>Greetings!

<p>
I would appreciate it if you would pass this information on to anyone in
the Diplomacy hobby who may be interested.

<p>
I have now lived in my house for eleven years, and yet I have never been
able to put a car in my double garage because, of course, it is filled
with The Diplomacy Archives. And so is my home office, and my guest
room! :-)

<p>
I have decided to reclaim that space for myself.  So.....
I have decided to dispose of The Diplomacy Archives.

<p>
The Diplomacy Archives are the largest and most complete collection of
Diplomacy magazines in the world, I believe; being particuarly strong in
the ``Golden Age" of the hobby period, c. 1966 - 1971.  The collection
includes thousands and thousands of items filling some 70 boxes and
weighing approximately one ton. Just a list of what's included runs some
70 pages.

<p>
Except for my own personal collection, everything goes.  It's an all or
nothing offer, and all items are ``as is."

<p>
The collection is for sale.  I will not give it away.  The minimum bid
is US$2,200, FOB San Diego, California.  The buyer must arrange for
packing and removing the entire collection from my garage within 90 days
of acceptance of their offer.  A non-refundable deposit of US$220 will
be due within 10 days of acceptance of that offer, and the balance must
be paid within 30 days.

<p>
The buyer may or may not, as he wishes, also take all back issues of <i>DW</i>
that I have, mostly issues published by Rod Walker or myself.  If he
doesn't, I will dispose of them.

<p>
Any questions may be directed to me at Larry Peery, 6103, Malcolm Dr.,
San Diego, CA 92115, USA, or by email, or submitted in writing to me at
WDC in Namur.

<p>
Opening bids are due by 1 June. Final bids will be due by 1 July.

<p>

<center>Thanx. Larry Peery, peery of ix.netcom.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I thank you for being organized about this, but forgive me
if I remind you that you haven't a snowball's chance in hell of 
garnering an offer of that magnitude.
The Hoosier Archives story (which is stronger than yours in the beginning
of the hobby and weaker than yours after 1977 or so) shows that clearly.
I will state for the record that the best solution is to merge it with
the Hoosier Archives and hope that someday Jamie McQuinn is in a job
where he can donate it to a University library where he is working and
they will pay him to catalog it.
Jamie has been very, very silent of late, which makes this bad timing.
Still, I can't imagine Jamie putting up that kind of money.))</i>

<p>
<i>((As always, [and hey, Geryk and Zarse would have thought they
got out with less than their money's worth if there wasn't a crazy
Peery offer in the issue of their return] I hope that there is someone
out there who wants and can handle these archives.
I've seen them and they are impressive.
Then, I hope they can negotiate you off your ``minimum bid''.
We'll see.
I'm sure we will all stay tuned.))</i>

<p><br><p><br>
<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>It also is time to ask for your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
I plan to have my list in NEXT time.
I'm a bit rushed at the moment, but two subszines will keep this issue huge.

<p>

<center>***TIME TO VOTE***</center><br>

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
two songs (5 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
You also get ONE B-52 song vote (although you can add votes from your
main allotment if desired) and THREE Drug Song votes which will be
held in a separate category.
The other ``special'' bullpens must be voted on from your main allotment
of votes.
I decided that I WILL print running totals and print the names of the
people who have voted.
Also, you guys wrote some great stuff about the songs, so I've printed
that too!
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!
Everything that started in the bullpen started with one vote.

<p>
To encourage voting early, five voters at random will receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff).
I will take these voters at random every other issue, starting with
this issue, and draw one randomly, so early voters get FIVE chances
to win, but no one will be allowed to win twice.
I'm also giving the round one voters below five chances in said drawing,
those in the second round four, and so on, to more heavily penalize the
chances of those last minute voters and reward these pioneers!
That should do it!!
Mike Barno wins five dollars for this issue's prize.
Prizes also will be awarded in issues 217, 219, 221, and 223.
Voters thus far through Round 1 are Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper, Tony Dickinson,
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>

I'm holding off on updating the list this time for a couple of reasons.
I just gotta get caught up with my postal mail letters.
I'm not.
Next issue, ONLY postal entries will be available for the drawing
with the ones I already have counting double.
Then I'll also get the other ones I have into the count.
Stan Johnson quite legitimately called me onto the carpet about this
and I plead guilty.
But, given last issue's fiasco, this issue WILL be on time.

From: (Mark D Lew)

<p>
Be careful with the Quayle quotes.  The Latin America one is a demonstrated
folk myth, originally deriving from a comedian's joke, later repeated as
truth.  As far as I know the rest you list are accurate.  There's a long
list of Quayle quotes floating around (perhaps the same one Paul sent you)
on which about 90% of them are specifically attributed. That is, it is
noted where Mr Quayle actually spoke the words, not just a reference to
some newsmagazine that mentioned it later. Those 90% can be presumably
genuine; the other 10% are probably fake.
<i>((Some of these I **knew** to be true because I'd seen the 
videotapes, but I still should have been more careful.
I need to contain my glee to republish stuff.
I'm always caught up short.
Don't tempt me guys, don't send me that kind of stuff!!
Simon Billenness gets the only pass on this count since that's the only
way I hear from him and he sends me all the cool stuff like the ``bugs''
in the Microsoft Word thesaurus (look up synonyms for ``Bill Clinton'').))</i>

<p>
I don't pay much attention to politics anymore. Is John Kasich running for
president? I've always been a sucker for budget wonks, in both parties. Is
Gore being perceived as conservative again, or is that just from Paul's
perspective?  I remember in 1988 (when I signed on to his short-lived
California primary campaign) Gore was seen as a ``neo-Dixie-crat" Sam Nunn
wannabe, but then by 1992 he was being called a starry-eyed liberal
tree-hugger, even though he himself really hadn't changed much. I still
think Tipper gets a bad rap on the record-labeling business. Her position
was much more reasonable than you'd think from reading the caricatured
attacks by Frank Zappa and the <i>Village Voice</i> etc. Maybe she's changed since
the topic first came up in the late '80s but back then she always pushed
the record labeling as a full-disclosure-of-information sort of issue, and
was opposed to any actual banning.  Also, she consistently focused her
criticism on violence rather than sexual content.  I used to have a copy of
an interview (probably still around in some file somewhere) where the guy
asks her about ``Why don't we do it in the road?" and she says, ``That's a
great song. I have no problem with that, so long as he doesn't kill her
afterward."  Tipper is cool.  I actually met her once (very briefly).
She's a politician's wife, to be sure, but not at all the stick-up-the-butt
matron that some would have you believe.  In college, she was a drummer in
an all-girl rock band.  How many senator's wives can make that claim?
<i>((Precisely.
We have discussed this before and I too like Tipper, even though I'm 
generally against censorship.
Tipper is another of those great strong women that are truly sexy.))</i>

<p>
I also pay little attention to popular culture, though I did see the second
half of the Oscars presentation, because I was visiting Jason and Gwen who
insisted on seeing it.  Bocelli was not as bad as I expected (opera snobs
*really* hate that guy...), but Celine Dion was worse.  Naturally, I didn't
know any of the movies.  In recent months it occurred to me to try to
remember what was the last (original-release) movie I've seen and I
honestly don't know what it is.  I'm certain I haven't seen any movie from
1998 or 1997, and I'm not even sure about 1996.  The last movie I
distinctly remember seeing in a theater was <i>Little Women</i>, which my mother
insisted on seeing as a family outing one Thanksgiving.  I also remember
seeing <i>Mighty Aphrodite</i> with my favorite ex-girlfriend, but I think that
was earlier. I know I've seen <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> and I think that was
in a theater, too. Maybe there has been another since then, but if so I
can't remember it. I have a vague recollection of visiting a Berkeley movie
theater with someone not too long ago (spring 96?) but I don't remember who
I was with, and I don't remember what we saw.

<p>
I do a little better on old movies.  J&amp;G were surprised when I told them
I'd actually seen three of the Kubrick films they clipped on the Oscars
thing (<i>2001, Shining</i>, and <i>Clockwork Orange</i>). I notice you don't list
Stanley for ``the best futuristic dystopia movie".  Second place behind
<i>Blade Runner</i>, maybe?
<i>((Here we go with the first of a series.... what is <b>Clockwork 
Orange</b>?
I couldn't decide on anything so I just left it out.
It surely is a great movie with brilliant images that sear into your brain.))</i>

<p>
``The Old Dope Peddlar'' is on <i>Songs by Tom Lehrer</i>. Lehrer is so cool. He's
the only songwriter I know who rivals Cole Porter for creative rhyming.
(Well OK, maybe W.S. Gilbert.) A few years ago I actually had Lehrer's
``Smut" ready as a patter song for an audition, though I ended up not
singing it. I've recently switched to ``A tenor, all singers above" from
G&amp;S's Utopia Ltd., but I really don't audition much at all anymore.

<p>
A recent Jeopardy clue put Croatia on the ``Balkan Peninsula".  Not just in
the Balkans, mind you, but on the ``peninsula".  Yeesh, that's like saying
Venice is on the Italian peninsula, or Kashmir is on the Indian
subcontinent.

Boy, Jim-Bob, I get a whole month off work, with pay (thanks to accrued

Sondra is already in Miami, and will be performing in the Florida Grand

down April 6 and return on the 22nd.  I can do some serious goofing off 
(there's an oxymoron for you) in southern Florida for two weeks.  No 
suntan, though; I have this northern European skin, and I turn into a 
radish if I'm outside for a couple of hours.  I generally use my trusty

of starting the season on Sunday night.  The season begins with the first 
pitch of the Reds' home game.)  Life begins again.  Oh, here's another 
side benefit of my month off:  Marlins home games (I THINK that's still

I was stunned by his death. He has always been one of my favourites. But in
your list you forgot to mention my favourite Kubrick movie; <i>A Clockwork
Orange.</i> This movie also has a bit on unusual Oscar trivia involved with it.
Who was the only transsexual to win an Oscar? Answer - Walter/Wendy Carlos for
best score. 
<i>((I thought that he didn't become a she until around 1977 or so....
then it needs to be ``future transsexual''.))</i>
IMHO it still ranks as one of the best film scores ever. Whenever
I want to scare people at work I skip down the corridors singing, ``I'm singing
in the rain (KICK), just siiiinging in the rain (KICK!)"

<i>((Silliness and fun in music are essential.

Several years ago the cartoon program ``Tiny Toon Adventures" did spoof videos
of ``Particle Man" and ``Istanbul (not Constantinople)" which were utterly
hysterical. My personal fave of theirs is ``I Hope That I Get Old Before I Die"

THE GREATEST SPORTSMAN OF THE CENTURY: 
Considering recent events I think there is going to be a lot of sympathy votes
for a particular New York Yankee. My opinion: it has to be a player who
radically altered the game was played, shattered virtually every record and is
beloved by virtually everyone without the massive amount of self promotion
that Michael Jordan gave to himself. There are only two people who are in this
category: Jack Nicklaus and Wayne Gretzky. Pele might come close. 

<p>
On Jim Thome:
Too bad Thome is never going to see any playing time at first anymore. Looks
like Sexson has that job wrapped up. 

<p>
On the Clippers <i>((Who finally are winning games, as in more than one!))</i>:
They've been bad for longer than that. When they were here in Buffalo (from
1970-1977) they made the playoffs once (and were quickly disposed of by the
Celtics) despite having such players as Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith, Providence
alum Ernie diGregorio, Adrian Dantley, Garfield Heard and my all time
favourite player to watch, Jack Marin. I'd be surprised if anyone outside this
area even remembers that the Clippers were stolen from good ol' Western New
York. Mention the names John Y. Brown and Paul Snyder to me and I'm likely to
get violent. 
<i>((I, too, loved Jack Marin 'cause he looked so cool!!))</i>

<p>
<i>((Commenting on my prediction:
``Michigan State and Kentucky easily make it to the Sweet Sixteen and are
joined by upset specials URI''))</i> 
Blowing your predictions early this year, aren't you?
<i>((Hey, I let some local color influence me.
I really thought they would make it to the Sweet Sixteen, but no farther.
BUT, I was not wrong that that segment of the bracket would have an upset
special, I just was wrong about which one it was.
Oklahoma, the 13 seed, of course, came out of there instead of the 12 seed.
I was almost right on perfect target with Kentucky and MSU.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Sat, 27 Mar 1999 10:31:23 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
So, UCONN is finally in the Final Four, and I cannot even watch
the games on TV.  :P
<i>((Rick was stuck in Germany.... how terrible!))</i>

<p>
My picks this year were pretty disastrous.  Let's put it this way:
after only the first day of play, I had already lost two of my
Final Eight picks: UNC and UCLA.   I've always picked against the
West Coast teams, but after their successes the past couple years,
I picked each of the four Pac-10 teams to win at least one game.
Only one of them did, and they (Stanford) only won one.
<i>((Oh come on, I thought those picks were cake this year.
UNC and UCLA weren't going anywhere.
That's why, once I looked at the tournament more through the
week, Florida and Ohio State's paths to the Sweet Sixteen were
obvious.
I also picked up on Gonzaga as a Sweet Sixteen upset special but
NEVER thought they would get beyond that.
The point guard's training by John Stockton was enough for me
to bet on a great story.
I still thought that Oklahoma State would do better than it did,
but at least I was right that Auburn didn't get very close to
the Final Four.))</i>

<p>
I did pick UConn and Duke to make the Final Four, along with
Maryland and Kentucky (a pair of popular picks).  I didn't forsee
the successes of either Gonzaga or SW Mo St.  Gonzaga looks to
be good enough to be a Top 10 team.  I think my picks suffered a
lot since I couldn't watch any games this year.  As far as I knew,
Ohio State was overrated and the Big Ten was going to pull its usual
second-round flop.

<p>
<i>((But Ohio State had the tournament recipe for success, two
great guards.
You always gotta find a few of those teams with a great backcourt
and ride 'em.
That's just history!
My final, final FINAL FOUR before the games started was Kentucky,
Duke, Connecticut, and Oklahoma State (with Ohio State a second
favorite sleeper).
Once I heard about Tim James' injury, I knew Miami was going to be
deep sixed early on (though I thought by Texas) and that Duke had
the proverbial ride to the Final Four.
I still thought UConn would win it though.  
SW Missouri State was an obvious pick to me, though a lot of
sleeper experts were picking Delaware.
I was proudest of my pick of Miami of Ohio.
I couldn't remember Wally Szczerbiak's name, but I had his number.
43 points, 12 rebounds, and the game winning blocked shot against 
Terry Tallman's Washington team to win the game
singlehandedly was the performance of the tournament, until 
Richard Hamilton's tourney ending performance.))</i>

<p>
My women's tourney picks were much better.  But there it's relatively
easy to pick the Sweet Sixteen.  Each of the top four seeds plays
home games for the first two rounds, and, surprisingly, this year
each of the top four seeds in each region won two home games!  I went
a bit nuts and picked Rutgers to beat Purdue.  After UConn and
Tennessee lost, I was toast.  I didn't get a single Final Four team
right (I picked two #1 seeds, but the wrong two.)
<i>((My Women's tourney picks sucked.... I was later informed
that Duke and Purdue were the teams to pick (over that first weekend)
by a knowledgeable friend and then I rooted for Purdue!))</i>  

<p>
I picked UConn to beat Duke in the final, not so much because
I thought they would, but because I figured most other people would
be picking Duke, so I wouldn't pass anybody unless there was an
upset.
<i>((I actually thought they would win.
The line before the game illustrates just how skewed the betting was.
Of course, that was not a realistic assessment of the final score,
just a way to balance the bets.))</i>

<p>
I write this a few hours before the games begin.  I expect Jim
Calhoun to be beat Jim O'Brien yet again in the opener tonight, and
I would be deeply surprised if Duke lost to MSU.  

<p>
I am not as impressed with Duke as many other people are.  Sure they
went undefeated in the ACC, but this was really a down year for the
ACC.  Only three teams made the tourney, and UNC didn't even win
a game in spite of a #3 seeding.  Also, Duke was taken to overtime
by St. John's and beat MSU by fewer points than UConn did.  If you
did a common opponent analysis, UConn would look better.  
They didn't get taken to overtime either time they played St. John's
and they beat MSU by 14 points, compared to Duke's 6 point victory.
Interestingly, MSU has already played all three of the other Final
Four teams.  But they only ended up 1-2 in those three games.
<i>((Precisely.
I thought the telling statistic on Duke was precisely that they
WEREN'T challenged before the final.
You knew UConn was going to come to play, they would have to play
from behind, and it just was too unfamiliar to them.
UConn played from behind all year.))</i>

<p>
I get a bit irked at the writers who mutter about how UConn never
made the Final Four before, in spite of being to the Elite Eight
three times.  The first time they made it that far, they lost
on a last-second shot to a team (Duke) which went on to win the
tournament.  The second time they were just not as good (UCLA).
But it probably didn't help that they had to play in California.
Then last year they got to go to Greensboro to play UNC.  Also,
again, they really were not as good as UNC.  

<p>
It's not like Calhoun teams have been underperforming, like say
a Boeheim team or a Lute Olson team.  They've gotten exactly as
far as they should.

<p>
And this year, they are probably the second-best team in the
country.  

<p>

<center>Rick, rick_desper of yahoo.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Wrongo, ye of little faith!
and I told you that BEFORE THE GAME!))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 30 Mar 1999 03:56:49 -0800 (PST))</b>

<p>
Wow, Jim, you really picked them right!  They found a way to win.

<p>
Sadly, I was unable to watch, but I knew they <i>could</i> win,
I just thought they shouldn't be favored.  Still, I found the Vegas
line (Duke by 9 1/2 points) ridiculous!  Duke couldn't beat MSU
by 10 points and UConn had already shown they were better than MSU.
<i>((The line is based on the bettors.
The last New England team to win it all was Holy Cross in 1947 or
something like that?
The wider mass of people across the country just didn't think the
Big East was as good as those of us who watched it closely thought
it was.
I really thought Miami would have beaten Duke earlier if everyone
had been healthy and St.&nbsp;John's just BARELY missed the Final Four
themselves.
I thought the REDMEN (I still won't call them that other name)
would collapse just that little bit at some point, but I thought
they wouldn't even have to face Maryland.
That was a great game!!))</i>

<p>
I was wrong in my last letter saying  they were probably
the second-best team in the land.  They showed they are the best
team in the land. 
<i>((Thank you, thank you, thank you.))</i>

<p>
Of course, some idiots in the media are calling it a huge
upset and are wondering how could this dominant Duke team lose
to anybody?  We're not talking Villanova over Georgetown or NC State
over Houston here.  UConn was ranked 3rd in the country at the end
of the season, and only that low because idiot pollsters put MSU
higher even though MSU had four losses to UConn's two, and MSU had
actually lost to UConn!  When a team which has been ranked #1 for
ten weeks actually wins the NCAA tournament, that's not a huge upset.
Like I said in my last letter on this subject, if you did a common
opponent comparison, UConn would actually look better.  I guess
there was something to that. 
<i>((Nonsense to all who called it a big upset.
See above on the view of New England basketball.
All of UConn's losses were at home where there were either injuries
or other obvious letdowns.
They beat everyone everywhere else.))</i>

<p>
But at least I picked them to win.  If only my opening round
picks hadn't been so horrible I might have had a chance to win
one of the pools I was in.
<i>((With my picks, I would have done pretty well.
Next year, I'll have to enter.
I don't bet, but I'd like to show my cards against the best.))</i>

<p>
On the ESPN site, I was at about the 20% level after two
rounds.  I only had 7 teams left in the Sweet Sixteen.  Thankfully
two of them were UConn and Duke.  After picking each game correctly
in the Final Four, I finished above the 90% level and took first
place in my group (the South Park Cows Rule!)  (that's the name
of the group, not a comment about the Cows).  

<p>
At Yahoops!  I did even a little better.  I changed a couple
picks, including letting Auburn make the Sweet Sixteen, so I wasn't
nearly as badly off after two rounds.  
<i>((I really, really thought Oklahoma State was going to beat Auburn.
Darn!
In a parallel universe....))</i>
I ended in a tie for 6920th
out of 205,800 entries.  I also passed a whole bunch of people in
the UConn fans group.  I think at least 80% of the people in that
group picked Duke to win.  
	
<p>
I think I could handicap sports for a living.  If I can
do better than 90% of the people when I have only watched 3 games
all season, then I should be able to get by.  The key would be to
recognize which lines are totally ridiculous (like Duke by 9 1/2
points over UConn) and play there.  Of course, it would be much
safer to buy stocks than to gamble.  (And a bit more ethical, too.)
<i>((You and I approach these things similarly.
You do have to have good mathematical intuition,
but you also have to care less.
I easily can do things with mind wide open on whim now.
If it were my bread and butter, could I do it?
I don't know.))</i>
	
<p>
Did your picks garner you any rewards?  You had the same
Final Four I did, but your earlier rounds were much better.

<i>((I had eleven out of sixteen in my ``final picks" and two of
four in the Final Four, plus the ultimate champion.
And I only missed two big sleeper teams.
I hate missing the sleeper teams.
I live for predicting those.
I love Wally!!
I really screwed up the NIT, but no one noticed.
Other picks I didn't get were Creighton upsetting Maryland.
If I didn't say it above, I came to my senses about Murray
State and picked Ohio State to go to the Sweet Sixteen and
then lose to Oklahoma State.
That Oklahoma State pick was not good in retrospect.
I should have gone with Ohio State longer.
I had Florida winning the Florida/Gonzaga game, but hey,
who else even had Florida playing Gonzaga in that round???
All in all, my best tournament of picking 'em yet.
I'm pleased.

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Players who haven't sent their $15 for your life of the game sub and
game fee with NMR insurance should do so immediately or risk being
replaced.
At least one of you will be replaced since we have eight players
for the seven positions.
Scott Munson ($15), Richard Pinelli ($15), Jim Sayers ($20), Chris Trent ($15)
Harold Zarr ($20), and Luke Dwyer ($15) are definitely in.
Whichever of Roland Sasseville and Dan Gorham gets their money in first
will take the last position.
I only have preference lists from two of you, so it will be a random
draw unless I get deluged with preference lists.
I'm going to wait to start this for just one more issue for both those
reasons (to give more time for preference lists and getting money in).

<p>
We also have the Colonia VIIb game filled with the same 
concern about money and one potential replacement waiting
in the wings (we need nine in 
total - Austria, China, England, France, Netherlands, Ottomans,
Portugal, Russia, and Spain).
We have Scott Morris ($15),
Robert Stimmel ($15), Heath Gardner ($15),
John Power ($15), 
Paul Rauterberg ($10), Gene Prosnitz ($15), and Stan Johnson ($15)
paid and ready.
Remember that if I don't have preference lists from everyone
this will be a random draw.
I think I only have two preference lists so far in this one too,
no, three.
This game now DEFINITELY WILL START next issue.
The last two players without money in yet are Terry Gamble and
Bob Acheson.
Bob says his money is in the mail and my standby Karl Schuetz 
will replace Terry Gamble if I don't have Terry's money by next deadline.

<p>
I also now have the OFFICIAL starting positions for Colonia VIIb, which
are:

<p>
1) Starting Positions (from Gene Prosnitz - discrepancies are against the map):

<p>
 AUSTRIA: a BUDAPEST, a VIENNA, a SURINAM*,
f TRIESTE, f TAHITI*.

<p>
 CHINA: a PEKING, a WUHAN, a XIAN, f AMOY.

<p>
 ENGLAND: a ECUADOR*, a NIGERIA*, f MALAYA*, f EDINBURGH, f LONDON.

<p>
 FRANCE: a PARIS, f TOULON, a DAKAR*, a QUEBEC*,
a BORDEAUX.

<p>
 NETHERLANDS: a ANTWERP, a FLORIDA*, a ANGOLA*,
f HAGUE, f MELBOURNE*.

<p>
 OTTOMAN: a ISMIR, a JERUSALEM, a BAGHDAD, f ISTANBUL,
f HAWAII*.

<p>
 PORTUGAL: a LAGOS, a ALASKA*, a GOA*,
a BRAZIL*, f LISBON.

<p>
 RUSSIA: a MOSCOW, a KIEV, a OMSK, a CAPE COLONY*,
f ST.PETE(SC), f VLADIVOSTOK.

<p>
 SPAIN: a MADRID, a MEXICO*, a SOMALIA*, f VALENCIA, f MANILA*.

<p>
 Paul Rauterberg (and others): The country between Ghana and Togo 
is ``Ashanti".
Suez does have two coasts and there is not a canal.

<p>
 *'ed home colonies are building centers for any power which
captures them.

<p>
 Special supply centers are Nanking (China), Naples (Austria, Spain),
and Crimea (Ottoman, Russia) and can be building centers only for the specified
powers.

<p>
 Finally, I was alerted that the game begins in 1701 (we will do this)
and that there are special rules for retreats for the Pacific Islands that 
allows dislodged armies to retreat back to land spaces (or other islands)
ONLY across one's own fleets.
This seems like a reasonable rule and we will use it as long as I get
some feedback that I have this rule correct.
Is there anything else I need to know to start us up??

<p>
Breaking Away is almost full for the next opening, see the sign-up 
list discussion under the game below.

<p>
I have an opening for a game of Star Trek Diplomacy!
This will be the last Diplomacy game opening until a game or two ends.
Even though there has been no interest yet, perhaps some will develop
if it is my only opening.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I'll take input on this idea.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Species 8472 has been in two segments of Voyager and is a very intriguing
diplomatic race (their episodes are the only Voyager episodes I've liked
in the last year) and the rest of the races should be well known to all.
No interest in this game?
I really want to run this.
I guess I gotta work on my map and publish it.

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) There were a number of questions that popped up about how this
works that I will try to answer here.
First, to Heath Gardner, this is the VERY first time this particular
variant with these particular rules has been played.
However, it combines some very successful elements that I believe
will make this the most popular variant of all-time!!!!
All this once the rest of the universe recognizes my genius....
mooo-hah-hah-hah-HAH!!!
(hyork, hyork, hyork...)
Poor Mike Barno illustrates the dangers of the game as he must wait
for 1902 to rejoin us, even his nukes were completely useless.
Note those (2)'s in parentheses following his nuke orders?
These tell you how many nukes struck that province.
Since multiple nuke strikes have no additional effect, these 
weapons were in fact, wasted.
In Mike's favor, thus, he has harmed no one, but been harmed to the bone
himself. (what else I know, I ain't tellin')
I also noticed over Piedmont that my adjudication notation left a
potential confusion.
I put moves in italics that do not go AND I put any unit that has been
destroyed by a nuke in italics.
John's army Venice was both bounced by Richard's army in Marseilles
AND annihilated by Richard's nuke (the double whammy!).
Suggestions for adapted notation will be accepted, otherwise I will assume
that you are all bright people who will be able to figure these sorts
of things out.

<p>
2) Heath Gardner may be changing his E-Mail address.
I have listed both the new and old ones this issue since I'm not
sure where he is finally ending up.

<p>
2) If you make a hostile move and bounce, you could get vaporized.

<p>
3) If you make a hostile move and don't bounce, you could get vaporized.

<p>
4) If you make a neutral move, you could get vaporized.

<p>
Now that I've explained this to everyone, it should be clear what to do. No
need to thank me; it's enough for me to know that I've helped people.
<i>((Some people are busybodies, some people are scholars, some people
are statesmen (errr, I mean, politicians.... no, make that weasels),
but others are... well, others are just saints!))</i> 

<p>
(JOHN BOY - BOOB &amp; RICHARD): That wasn't me.
I didn't nuke myself.
I'm sure it was someone named Mike.
Maybe even Barno??
<i>((Actually, I think it was David Wang.
I'm too lazy to go look through all those back issues to check it out.))</i>
BTW, just because we have a military base on an island, and postage is
only 33 cents, doesn't make it ``Good ol' US of A.''
The question is, do the <i>real</i> residents <i>feel</i> like they 
are citizens?

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that we have Winter builds and then Spring follows quickly.
I urge that you use all the time before the Spring deadline to be
negotiating for Spring.
Don't just send in your builds and wait.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL JON RHODEHAMEL to THE RUSSIAN NATION): While the Diplomats
discuss political agendas I have decided to begin the Great World War by
taking what belongs to Austria!
Let it begin.
The War cometh!

<p>
(FROM THE HUT OF THE TOADA to THE FAR OFF SKY WALKER): And you think YOU got 
problems?  Well actually you do.  And I have tried to be encouraging but I 
suspect you got greased by the same person as several others out there. 
But it's ok.  Speak softly and toady to a bigger toad!

<p>
(ADMIRAL KIRK VON AUSTIN): I agree with Field Marshal Rhodehamel!
We take now and ask later!
It is the Austrian way....

<p>
(TOAD HALL LECTURE SERIES): For those of you new to the campus there are a 
couple of things to think about.  There are concepts that are mistaught at 
some of the lower levels of postal dip, e-dip or even face to face.
	
<p>
A major misconception is that Toads are bad.  Toads are, in fact, good. 
The true toad nutures his toadies, supplies them with information, ideas 
and assistance in growing into big, fine, fat, dot filled toadies.
	
<p>
Toads come in various colors or course.  The lesser toads usually 
encourage their toady friends and then gobble their dots at the first hint 
that the toady is in trouble.  Has someone fed you information that appears 
to be about to cost you dots?  Prestige?  Or even survival?
	
<p>
That is a BAD toad.  His (or her-although I have never met a BAD female 
toad) secretions, particularly those known as ``e-mail", are poisonous in 
the extreme.  You must take a series of colder and colder showers while 
pretending to still believe the BAD toad.  The BAD toad will be totally 
unaware of just how cold a shoulder you are giving him (or IMPOSSIBLY her) 
until it is too late.
	
<p>
Next week we will be lecturing on Barno's ``love children" and their 
positions on the board.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR KENT POLL&#196;RD): Zis is an outrage!
Za High Command is acting on its own agenda.
It seems gentlemen zat a Great Vorld Var is beginning!
Vell.
I had better begin to stock up on za brandy.
It vill be a long one....

<p>
(MOSCOW to BERLIN): That last press wasn't mine.
If you leave me alone I won't try to invade.

<p>
(PIERRE ScrUem): The President of France Pierre ScrUem strode quickly 
through the great hall.
His Light Blue uniform looking shiny and new.  ``What have we here?" He raged!
Pierre ScrUem was not one to appreciate problems during battle.  A young aid
rushed to hand him a note.  
     
<p>
``Sir the Germans have sent word that Belgium will be held by none other
than the Kaiser himself."  Pierre ScrUem stops in his tracks and snatches the
note from the aid.
     
<p>
``I have dealt with swine like this before." Pierre ScrUem says while looks
out the widow.  ``There is only one way to deal with scum like the Germans.
When they say one thing you shove the opposite down their beer guzzling
throats."  He reaches for this table and opens some wine  ``Yes I think we are
going to have to enlist our chum Flashman to the south to help us with
breaking this wayward country."

<p>
(MR. FLASHMAN to MR. POLL&#196;RD): Old boy.
After recently visiting the Archduke and his lovely family I have come
to the conclusion that Austria sports the ladies aplenty!
Quite the tumbling ground!
The Pope is pleased upon receiving the 3 cases of bacon and brie cheeses
that you sent.
I look forward to discussing politics over a few bottles of cognac and we
could visit that area of Vienna where the young men christen themselves
in a baptism of revelry.

<p>
(GERMANY - AUSTRIA): Stay south or else.  We don't cotton to your ties with
Turkey.

<p>
(THE KAISER to THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE): So.
You do not trust my people.
Perhaps we could demonstrate our battle techniques and show the French how to
be respectful.

<p>
(PIERRE ScrUem to ENGLAND): Now THAT is how an alliance works! 

<p>
(ENGLAND to ALL): Sorry for the silent treatment.
The dogs have been keeping me up all night.

<p>
(BRITAIN to TURKEY): So, you have a dog named Maryjane?
That must be the picture you sent me.
How come both of you are taking a shower together?

<p>
(AUNT POLLY'S AUSTRIAN BATH HOUSE IN GREATER DOWNTOWN TUSCANY):  The towel 
person walks up behind the Italian Vacationer and says, ``Say buddy, you 
wanna pick up that soap fer me?"
	
<p>
``Why of COURSE!" exclaimed the Italian Vacationer.  (I mean, for Ghod's 
sake!  He isn't a warrior or he'd be off some place making WAR, for Ghod's 
sake!)
<i>((You can say THAT again!!
I don't think I've ever seen Italian moves quite like those.
He must be harvesting the wine and forgetting that drinking it instead
of selling it tends to immobilize armies....))</i>

<p>
(TOAD to BARNO THE TURKEYSAUR): Well, not bad but can you pull a rabbit out 
of that hat?

<p>
(SERBIA THE FREE): The cleansing of the Magyars is complete!
We are free and we wish to remain that way.
The Serbians shall look elsewhere for more eradication programs.
Perhaps the Bulgarians would do....
<i>((I know you intended that tongue in cheek, but I thought I 
would take that opportunity to slip in some Balkan War thoughts.
You know, I think NATO faced the decision that they made in this
way.
Serbia was set to cleanse Kosovo of all non-Christians and the
Kosovo rebels are basically as reprehensible ethnic cleansers as
the Serbs.
Thus, arming the Kosovo Liberation Army, shutting things off, and
letting them fight just wasn't an option.
Whoever won would eventually cleanse the other.
Then, they really were worried about the continued expansion of
this mission south into Macedonia and wanted to ABSOLUTELY isolate
Serbia as the destabilizing force in the region.
Thus, the bombing attack was not expected to ``succeed''.
How could it???
But it was expected to politically isolate Serbia and give NATO
time to assemble ground troops, if they eventually would be
required (I suspect they will, but it's possible we will just
let the Serbs finish the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and then
we will isolate them economically and politically from all their
neighbors).
The one Allied miscalculation was that I think they expected a
flood of horrendous atrocities that could be documented (both
in Kosovo and elsewhere) that for the most part aren't happening.
This is by choice outside of Kosovo.
Serbia could strike back in horrible ways against external civilian
populations, but they are standing still and ``taking one for the
team''.
I actually think that a judicious use of American power abroad is
necessary in the current world, including a willingness to have
Americans die for the cause of freedom in the world, but I'm not
sure this ``lesser of many evils'' campaign is going to make what
they want in the end.
We'll see, won't we.
Oh yeah, the other peacekeepers in areas surrounding Serbia are doing
a great job of providing a stabilizing policing presence and it was
thought that if we could just get ourselves into Kosovo the same
way it could be great.
Naw, ain't gonna happen.
I could be full of crap here, but that's how I see it.
I do think it was a classic Mexican standoff.))</i>

<p>
(TOAD to OLD FART DOWN UNDER): Interesting you are but dang it, I just can't 
seem to understand the punch line of your tale.
<i>((Maybe there wasn't a punch line...))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Here comes that Spring deadline!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY): Congratulations on the trifecta.  I'll be real 
interested to see where those new black blocks start marching, safe in the 
knowledge that I'm an unlikely target for your wrath.  Assuming you have 
some wrath.
<i>((Some wrath?
He needs no wrath, Go-El has superpowers and can wipe your butt from 
anywhere!!
Heh, heh, heh....))</i>

<p>
(GO-EL to M-ERT): I'm getting email.  But it took forever to get <i>TAP</i>.  
By the way, are your services available?  
I want someone sued for impersonating a Diplomacy player.

<p>
(ANKARA to BERLIN): Hey, Kaiser, how 'bout sending me some Hessian 
mercenaries?  I know you can spare them, and I sure could use some more 
firepower down here.  Why, there isn't an unoccupied dot within spittin' 
distance.
<i>((Ah, now I see and I don't even need X-Ray vision....))</i>

<p>
(ANKARA to MOSCOW): Two builds!  Not bad for a snail-mailer.  I don't think 
you should complain about the pace of communications for the rest of us; 
you've still done better than Kurt, Luke, and me, and you have no enemies 
leaning on your home dots.  Wanna trade countries?
<i>((Have you played with Russ before??
I thought not....))</i>

<p>
(RUSS-PAUL): Read your letter regarding politics in the last issue.
I'd hoped you'd grown out of all that free loader shit already.
Despite a couple of flaws, Nixon (Clinton just proved the flaws put
him ahead of his time) is still the best president in my lifetime.
Bush and Reagan could have been good if only they's had the balls to
stand up for what they supposedly believed in.
If there is a hell, LBJ will rot there for what he did to the country.

<p>
I'd forgotten the Anderson joke.
My girlfriend's brother was so excited about working for him.
You should have seen the look on his face when I said I was voting
for Reagan.
Come to think of it, I think it was the only time her parents liked me.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to HAMILTON): Good luck with your finals, Luke.  I'm 
guessing you'll get an A+ in European Geography.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA): That would be a DMZ.  As in, don't move there.  You told
me earlier who you thought was going to win.  I see now why you thought
that.  You are throwing it their way.  Doofus.

<p>
(TURKEY to GERMANY): Okay, let me get this straight:  You sweet-talked 
Goesle into supporting a move that NO ONE ELSE could bounce.  (No doubt 
you were worried that those pesky Swedish partisans wouldn't let you into 
their helpless nation without a fight.)  Whatever you put in his drink, 
could you send me a flask?

<p>
(TURK to LIMEY): Two boats, right?

<p>
(ITALY - GERMANY): Good boy.  I see that Russia is in Sweden.  See how easy 
that was?

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD): Friendly reminder; I'm officially kicked out of 
City Hall after April 1, so my e-mail address with the City is no longer 
good.  You can use my home address if you want (semmert of mindspring.com) 
until May 1, and then I'll have a new business address:  
Lsemmert of sykescarnes.com.  
Good luck tracking me down in April; I recommend the mindspring 
address, which I'll check as often as I can.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Since I like this game and am learning how to do this and have to
put my new knowledge to good use, I will start another game.
I'll keep the sign-up list here so that interested parties will see it
as they peruse the szine.
All games will start when they have precisely six players and for the moment
I will keep the game opening list always on.
This game will continue to be free, like Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire.
Currently in line for the next game are: 
Luke Dwyer, David Partridge, Rick Desper, Eric Brosius and John Schultz.
I'm going to run this one, but 
David has volunteered to run a game in <i>Tinamou</i>, so
when this second game gets started, I will be collecting interest
to play the third game there.
David should say which version of the rules he wants to use 
(I see at least three possibilities).
This game will be played under Version 2.3 of the rules printed recently
thanks to Keith Thomasson!
There are a number of differences between Version 2.3 and the version
we are playing with here in Version 2.2.
Some confusion between these two versions of the rules caused my GMing
errors here, so current players should look at these differences 
carefully, as they define the rules we are playing under:
(i) The maximum value of any new card is 15 (in Version 2.2 this is 
unlimited).
(ii) The Breaking Away bonus ONLY is earned on the first turn of
breaking away from the pack (in Version 2.2 this also is unlimited).
(iii) Overcrowding for the first turn is based on FOUR or more cyclists
on it and affects ONLY the square in FRONT treated as blank
(in Version 2.2 this was based on FIVE or more cyclists), and for these
versions, contrary to the preferred version of the game designer,
affects ONLY the square in front.

<p>
2) The other half of the Sprint points are awarded and the field is
a bit strung out.
Do the guys at the back have a chance to catch up?

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
 
<p>
(BUNNIES-FIELD):  How come it got so quiet all of the sudden?
<i>((Quiet?? 
Quiet??
Whatever do you mean??
Let's go on and see what others have to say and see if you
still want to characterize them as ``quiet''.))</i>

<p>
(WILL SHAKESPEARE): I think my iambic odometer is broken.

<p>
(MOPSY-KIND-HEARTED SCIENTIST): Do you have any <i>tortoise </i> genes?

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> NEWTON): Nice trying getting the smallest standard deviation
between your cards.  (3,4,3).  But Flopsy beat you (7,7,8,7).

<p>
(ALESSANDRO CYCLOTRON): TIME OUT!  I gotta tie my shoe!

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO. QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT CO., GOZ &amp; CO., INC.):
Profits off $26M this quarter, due to acquisition of new assets and huge
legal fees incurred in the form of bribes when the FTC inquired about a
potential bike part monopoly forming between us and the Stooges.  The good
news is most of the loss was recovered when the FTC legal team met an
untimely demise at the hands of a large kid on a bicycle with a rocket
booster.  The better news is that the recovered money doesn't have to be
reported to the shareholders.

<p>
(THE INVENTOR):
BTW, just a small clarification to the ``breaking away" rule.  This bonus
is received only on the first turn the cyclist breaks away, not only on
the first turn of Breaking Away (the game).  If you see what I mean.  Put
more lucidly, it does not apply to the first turn of the game but to the
turn on which the leader breaks away. Your notes in the last <i>TAP</i> say 
``the breaking away bonus is only earned on the first turn of Breaking Away"
which, particularly as the term ``breaking away" is capitalised, could
lead people to think it only applies on the first turn of the game.
I wonder if Keith has been playing it wrong?
<i>((I doubt it, it's probably more that I just can't write.))</i>

<p>
(ERIC-INVENTOR): I kind of like this game.  
It is pleasantly devoid of the irritating need for strategy and 
planning-or at least, for me it is.

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FLOPSY): Collecting sevens?

<p>
(TFWS -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> THE TRUE HOOSIER): Yes, I copy.
But I think we might hang back a little <i>too</i> far if we're not
careful.

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> HOOSIERS (BOTH OF YA)): Get yer butts up here!  

<p>
(TFWS -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> WHOEVER): The ``Brit Pack'' is looking damned good right 
about now.

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MOE): All my boys passed you - I hope you're not going
to let your brothers carry your team by themselves.  (Yeah,
and Larry Fine, too.)

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> SHAKESPEARE): Congrats on all the Oscars.  BTW, my father
is convinced that the Earl of Oxford wrote all those plays and
that ``Shakespeare" was merely a pen name.  Care to comment?

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BERNARD SPOKE): I first thought ``Bernard Spoke" was the
sequel to ``Atlas Shrugs".  

<p>
(ERIC -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FIELD): I made it!  I crossed the finished line.  Woo-hoo, 
I rule!

<p>
(KYLE -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> ERIC): Um, Eric, you finished 9th in an 8 horse race.  
You get diddly squat for that.

<p>
(ERIC -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BOOB): What!  $#$%$#$%    
You commie bastard pinko liberals!
Gimme my points!

<p>
(CHEF -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> MEG): You have to forgive Kenny when he's unclear.  
He tends to zip his coat pretty high, above his mouth.  He's
the South Park version of Mushmouth.  These are the three defining
characteristics of Kenny:

<p>
1) He zips his jacket way up, so it's hard to hear what he says.

<p>
2) He dies a lot.  

<p>
3) He's a real dirty little bastard.  (Can I say bastard in
this 'zine?)
<i>((Yes, fortunately or unfortunately, depending upon your point
of view, this is not always a family szine.
It does mean that some issues of the szine I can't access from my
work machine, which has a ``filter'' attached to it.
We'll see if this issue becomes one of them.))</i>

<p>
(STAN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> DAMON VELODROME): You asked ``How do you pee in these tight
pants."  Well, let Kenny demonstrate.

<p>
(Kenny pees in his tight pants.)  

<p>
(KIDS): hee hee hee

<p>
(WILL SHAKESPEARE): How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is;
To be dropped by the pack, you bastards.

<p>
(ERIC-BOOB):  I'm just a happy bunny.

<p>
(TFWS -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BOOB): I'll do better next time for sure.
And I'm not as ugly as some as it stands now.

<p>
(ALFRED THE GREAT to WILL SHAKESPEARE): You've been less ready than
Ethelred (actually ``unready" is a mistranslation of ``unrede", which means
``lacking in good counsel", but Ethelred the Ill-Advised does not look so
good in history books)

<p>
(ERIC-BOOB): What are you doing spelling ``supersede'' with a ``c'' 
in ``Saddam Hussein''&nbsp;?  
<i>((Speeling supercede with a ``c'', what do you think I was doing?))</i>
With all the words you print, one would think you'd have enough
practice spelling!  [Heh.]

<p>
(ERIC-BOOB): Hey, you start using a spell checker and the 
next thing you know you'll be showering with hot water!

1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Oh let's not think of tomorrow,
lest we disappointed be;
Our joys may turn to sorrow as we all may daily see;
Today we may be strong and healthy, but soon there comes a change...''
A song by Tommy Armstrong, written in the 1890's about the Trimdon Grange
explosion, recorded by the Mekons on <i>Honky Tonkin</i> their best
``country punk'' record (and thus liked by Eric Ozog....).

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): <i>TAP</i>-215 arrived 19 March.
Another hectic scramble to meet the deadline!
<i>((See above.))</i>
Yes, I'm getting too old for this sort of thing!
Had to take a week off from work due to stress.
My doctor measured my blood pressure at 170/100 and decided I needed
some rest.
As for explaining ``Categorical Imperatives'' to <i>TAP</i>, I need 
only put on the robe of Logical Positivism and point out that the
term ``Categorical Imperative'' may have no meaning unless it is
properly defined first.
<i>((Indeed.))</i>

<p>
However, if anybody out there has an interest in a philosophy book
that has had a DIRECT impact on my life, try William James; 
<i>Variety of Religious Experiences</i>.
This is the book Bill Wilson read when putting together the Alcoholics
Anonymous spiritual program.
He also listened to the original atheists and agnostics of AA, and
modified the 12 steps.
And that is why on 17 March 1999, this atheist celebrated 15 years of
sobriety.
Yes, I have read James' book, but I am curious as to how others evaluate
this prime example of the Pragmatic School of American Philosophy.

<p>
I will be on vacation in China 17 April-7 May.
Please take me off ALL standby lists until further notice.

<p>
Concerning your reviews of British szines, I have already used
your International Subscription Exchange to sub to <i>Dolchstoss</i>.
I have a bit of extra money, so would be interested in subscribing
to a couple more szines through the service.
Any recommendations?
<i>((Not at the moment, lots of flux over there right now.
Ask me again if I forget to discuss it.))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): Why did you not participate in the bombing of 
Serbia (Yugoslavia on a real map.) Since there is clensing going areound 
Why didn't you prevent this from happening. I guess in the Americans' 
eyes you don't own it. At least we respect your claim.

<p>
(A DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICANS): In case you overlooked it, February was 
National Potato Month.
Or as Dan Quayle spells it, Februarye.

<p>
(A REPUBLICAN-DEMOCRATS): It seems the real reason that the Democrats
switched their convention from Boston to Los Angeles was that Ted
Kennedy offered to be the designated driver.

<p>
(A DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICANS): Vince and Larry, the two crash test dummies, have
announced they will no longer appear in TV commercials.
After retirement they will work on Dan Quayle's presidential campaign.

<p>
(A REPUBLICAN-DEMOCRATS): Ted Turnr has apologized to the pope for telling
a Polish joke.
One more public apology and the Democrats will nominate Turner for President.

<p>
(P-U): I hope I am right in trusting you though I am not worthy!

<p>
(JERRY FALWELL-WORLD): Beware that bizarre creature who wears a purple
jumpsuit, carries a purse, and has a triangle on his head.
Some say he's straight, some say he's gay.
You know who I'm talking about.... Dennis Rodman, playing for the Lakers.
Next month I will be ``outing'' Snuggles, the fabric softener teddy bear.

<p>
(LAKER FAN-JERRY FALWELL): But it sure was exciting to see Rodman in purple
and gold.... but enough about his hair.

<p>
(P): Treaty is signed and approved and in the mail. May we all stick
together in the face of evil.

<p>
(FRANCE-ENGLAND): It would seem as if Global Warming is the cause of 
sharks appearing off English beaches for the first time.
They must be really desperate if they have to go to England looking for food.

<p>
(BERLIN to DANZIG):  Our best warriors came from Prussia.  Watch them 
return there!

<p>
(ELMO to GERMANY): ``Tickle us, shall we not laugh? Prick us, shall we not
bleed? Wrong us, shall we not seek revenge?" Klingon Warriors Way p. 131

<p>
(US ARMY-HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS): Yes, we want to recruit YOU under new
``Don't Ask, Don't Spell'' policy.
Just because you cannot make correct change at the local fast food outlet
doesn't mean you cannot accurately fire a Tomahawk missile.

<p>
(GERMAN EMBASSY PARIS): Hmm....  What is Harry to do?  Order A Auv to
Paris, to cut our support for Alsace to Lyon?  Order A Lyon to Paris, to
cut our backing of the Brit move on Auverne?  He'd be wisest to do both,
n'est-ce pas?
Shifting F Mar-Mon to leave retreating room for one of his armies might
be a wise course of action, but where does he put TWO fleeing units?
It must be a bitter pill to swallow, seeing a recently strong
secure power turn to dust in so short a time.  Harry, we hardly knew ye.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): In 1947 a flying saucer was alleged to have crashed
at Roswell, New Mexico.
Nine months later, Al Gore was born.
Coincidence?
We THINK Not!
And nine months ago, the only China Bill Clinton had to worry about was the
stuff Hillary was throwing at him.

<p>
(BRITAIN - SPAIN): Well, I'd like to... but... naaahhh... it just doesn't
seem practical...

<p>
(SEAN O'DONNELL to BOOB): They told me I was gullible.... and I believed them!

<p>
(BRITAIN - BOOB): Of course... three little dots aren't exactly the most
practical way to express a pregnant pause... either...

<p>
(SPIDER MAN to WORLD): Trust, but locate the doors.

<p>
(SILESIA):  A strong suicidal streak seems to have become the norm in
Poland.
(Their) silence is a golden excuse for us to decimate their homeland,
and to relieve them of the responsibility of wise rulership.  
The war with Ukraine must be conducted in a competent manner, 
by a power free from the distraction of invasions from all sides.  
That power can only be Germany.  Die well, and quickly, neighbor!

<p>
(STRAY PRESS): Vive La France! Hey this keeps popping up everywhere?

<p>
(WOLF-CROCODILE): One notes you are shedding tears over the demise of
France.
Perhaps you should keep an open mind about saving some tears for yourself.

<p>
(ROLAND to JIM): No berating this time despite the fact that ``hrork hrork"
to indicate your laughter deserves some sort of derision.
<i>((It is FAMOUS in the hobby, perhaps originated by the Great
Bob ``Sludge'' Olsen, or perhaps just popularized by him.
It probably was invented by Mike Mazzer.
Hey, someone could go find Mazzer.
He E-Mails me out of the blue once every two or three years, but 
I haven't heard from him in awhile.))</i>
I missed Boston as I was in the Big Apple. 
The mayor of Boston must be happy I was
because it kept the crime rate in his city down by one stabbing
incident!
<i>((Hyork, Hyork, hyork.... and spell it right next time!))</i>

<p>
(ROME-PARIS): It seems like a lot to dispatch 5 of my units to deal with
one lone pirate, but it will guarantee that the job will get done and I
can drive on to Monaco.  Bon Voyage, Little Frenchman!

<p>
(THE DARK SIDE-KIEV): Not much going on on the Eastern front at the moment,
but rest assured we will soon join the Sultan and the Little Pharoah to
deal with your rebel friends....

<p>
(AMBASSADOR AT&#196;TURK P&#214;-LLARD to AMBASSADOR PARTRIDGE): You are a
masterful Diplomat.
But... the War continues....

<p>
(MUNICH to AUSTRIA):  Did We get this mixed up?

<p>
(SPAIN-TURKEY): You can use the swords I'll stick to my (guns.)
On the other hand since your useing swords in a industralist war and is 
holding its own I must admit that your armies is the best amongst us.

<p>
(BRITAIN - SPAIN): You are a nervous sort to be sure.
Well, this time you were right to be, I suppose.
Let's see how long you can keep Iberia securely yours.

if you say that maybe as Dip players we out think ourselves.
<i>((Huh, did I say that?
I agree with you, you are the Master!))</i>

(STRAY PRESS CORRECTION): Vive La France!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The concession to Austria fails.
Concessions to Austria, Germany and Turkey are proposed.
Draws for FG, FGT, and FAGT also are proposed.
Please vote with your Winter.... well, just vote in Winter.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TUR-FRA): Are you really happy now?
<i>((I sincerely doubt it, he tried to support Germany and Germany
didn't take the support.
AND, in what would have been a more effective move [since Harold
could not have contributed to dislodging himself], YOU tried to support
Germany too!))</i>

<p>
(TUR-GER): Congratulations, no matter how achieved, a solo is a solo, 
is the end of the game.  
<i>((True, but we don't have one yet....))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM BOB): That's not fair.
To change the draw rules in mid-game.
<i>((We haven't changed the draw rules at any time.))</i>
I think draws in and of themselves are un-cool.
<i>((I basically agree, and so does Richard...))</i>
The failure to vote rule really sucks.
<i>((No it doesn't.
If someone wants to vote, they had better vote.
This way, no game ends before its time.
If you're bothered by people not voting, induce them to vote, don't
complain to the GM.))</i>
THe biggest un-cool of them all are draws involving nobodies.
<i>((Wrongo!
These are WAY-COOL.
As proposals, certainly!
Hey, if you don't like 'em, vote agin' 'em.))</i>

<p>
(TUR-AUS): I'm bitter that we had our chances and I blew them.  Sorry.  
<i>((Here's another one, what will you do with this one?
Holding Tyrolia is sufficient to break the line, but can you hold it?))</i>

<p>
(TUR-GM):  Thank you for pubbing the szine so I could learn again how 
stupid I am - as though I really should ``pay" for this knowledge.
<i>((Hey, you don't get out so easily!
Bring on some more stupidity!!))</i>

<p>
(TUR-BLACK PRESSERS AND GUEST CONTRIBUTORS):  Thanks for the increased
interaction and fun.	

<p>
(TUR-GER): I still would have preferred you to come after me and for us 
to have a great 1984 3-way battle. 

<p>
(GERMANY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): Kubla Kahn?

<p>
(TUR-FRA): Taking a fleet to SPA(SC) and MAR would have given you tempo
into the MED and to Italy.  Did it seem otherwise to you?  And why didn't
you pursue that option which would have made you equal to Germany and me
struggling for a very small draw line survival?
