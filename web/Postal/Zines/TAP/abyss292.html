<br /><br />I'm late this issue mostly because one player was late and yes.... I didn't
want to NMR him.  I'm not changing the other deadlines, given the situations
in those games, but I'll probably hold some or all of the games other than
Spirals of Paranoia over to <i>TAP</i> #294.
This also will allow us to run through my trip to Spain in July with another
szine out.
I won't name the player.... but he knows who he is as he finally got orders
to me on the masthead date above.
I'm actually going to be a few days later than that actually getting this
szine out the door since I'm travelling on business this week.
Cheers and happy summer to all, as it finally has arrived in this part
of the country!!
It also is time to pull the old games, isn't it.... small issue this time,
but a goody....

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR DEREK NELSON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm going to continue putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, 
working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
Derek Nelson is the person who won the first postal game in
<i>Graustark</i>.
He's been missing for at least 25 years, I know in the records I can
find that he attended the 1976 DipCon in Baltimore.
I think it will be fun if we can find these Golden Agers.
So, let's really find Derek, it's worth fifty bucks!!!
You have until issue #295 at the fifty buck price.
See a note from Doug Beyerlein below.... thanks, Doug, I hope
all of these people are found!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received TAP #291 yesterday.  The search for Derek Nelson and John 
Boardman's letter regarding same brought back old memories.  Derek 
Nelson introduced me to the world of Postal Diplomacy in February 1966.  
I was a high school sophomore at the time; he was in college.  He was 
living in (or visiting) Vancouver, BC, and saw my ad for players in the 
Avalon Hill General.  He and a friend drove down to Seattle and I 
assembled a group to play Diplomacy at my house.  He pulled out copies 
of Graustark, Big Brother, and Wild 'n Wooly.  That was the first I 
heard of the Postal Diplomacy hobby.  A few months later I joined the 
postal hobby.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Derek later moved back to Scarsborough, Ontario, and he and Bob Lake 
started their own Diplomacy zine.  I didn't see Derek again until the 
1976 DipCon in Baltimore.  At the DipCon I gave a talk on Talleyrand 
(there is a story in itself) and afterwards he walked up to me and asked 
me if I recognized him.  I didn't until he introduced himself.  That was 
the last I heard of or saw him.  I assume that he is still living in 
Canada, but have made no attempt to locate him.  I hope that someone 
tracks him down.

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au

They ARE going to make it and release it this fall, but there are a 
number of concerns and opportunities that this is going to create.
If anyone is interested, some of us have been in some informal contact
with the game designers, but I really don't have the time to fully
engage them.
I think the key note to take away is that they're surely going to design
a "simplified starter" version of the game that plays faster and more
exciting.
This is likely in some ways not to look like Diplomacy in any fashion
that people familiar with variants would state.
But they are committed to the basic design feature that you can make
promises that you can't be held to keep.
I don't want to be too negative or too positive about this development,
but it will be something that "changes the environment".
More on this for sure as I hear more.
You all should read the interview in the Spring 2005 movement issue
of the <i>Diplomatic Pouch</i> (and I mean ALL!!!!!!! of you!!!!!)

Just read your latest issue. Sorry to hear about Phil Reynolds, we
didn't agree on everything but I always liked him. I respected the
fact that he went into journalism because that's what he loved rather
than his original choice of computer science.
<i>((Yeah, Phil was a neat person, I met him only once, but
it seemed like he really found a publishing niche that gave him
a lot of satisfaction.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Leave it John Boardman to just hear about the contracting postal
hobby-I agree with your analysis. It's much easier to play on the web
now then any zine. I'm in several games on various judges and I
especially like the variants available. Currently I'm playing a couple
of different variants, my favorite being the Modern varient.
<i>((Yeah, I intend to keep waving this flag for the foreseeable
future, but it will increasingly be a more lonely flag.  
I honestly still don't get why someone hasn't started a REAL web
Diplomacy szine.
The Brits are doing the closest to it with Diplomacy 2000, Psychozine,
and For Whom the Web Rocks by Tom Tweedy, Mike Dean, and Keith 
Thomasson respectively.
But even there, these do not fully create a szine atmosphere.
I'm not sure if I'm creating it here any more either, I should say,
but a szine atmosphere is something you know when you see it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I feel more comfortable playing Dip on the web so if you want to form
a World Dip Tourney Team you can count me in as a player.
<i>((I would rather join a team that you formed rather than do the
work myself.
I don't seem to be successful at this sort of thing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I read your reply to Rick Desper on baseball. I can't say I follow the
whole league since finances forced me to drop from my fantasy football
league, but I am a die hard Phillies fan (with the team's awful track
record of most losses of any team in North America and the worst
overall record of any franchise in any sport-only ONE world
championship in 130 years-all Phillies fans are diehards) I will say
I think you're dead wrong on the Phillies-Thome, Burrell and Bell are
simply awful. Abreu and Utley are the best position players and only
All Stars the Phils have. Utley is a legitimate candidate for Rookie
of the Year (if he qualifies-he may have had too many at-bats last
year to qualify) but the bullpen, beyond closer Billy Wagner is
terrible. I think its a three way race between the Braves, Marlins and
Mets but I don't know if the Marlins or the Mets have the depth to
hang with the Braves. I do think the wild card will come out of the
East, the toughest division in the NL right now.
<i>((Yeah, especially with the complete and utter collapse of the
NL Central.
I thought the Cubbies and Astros would be a LITTLE better than they've been.))</i>

I am liking getting to know some of the DipWorlders a bit better

John's league was great because your team always was YOUR team,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm out of the country, but have followed most of the C's series.
They apparently completely collapsed in Game 7.
The NBA is in a bad state, and it only has itself to blame.  See
Bob Ryan's column about officiating?  It's telling that the biggest
fine in NBA history is levied on a coach who says an apparently
non-inflammatory thing, that the NBA was responding to Mark
Cuban's complaints about Yao Ming's moving screens.  Ryan mentions a
couple games which were essentially decided by free throws.  I could add
some legendary Knicks/Heat games that had the same problem.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a big problem: I do not trust NBA games to be officiated
fairly.  That Lakers/Kings game a few years back was legendary.
And the league is well known for favoring its "superstars" - "Bird
rules", "Jordan rules", etc.  Whether anybody can prove anything
is debatable, but does the league think that players would not
notice this phenomenon and react to it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My other big problem with the NBA is that the players seem
randomly motivated.  Well, it's larger than that - they don't play team
basketball anymore.  The US performance in the 2004 Olympics is
no fluke - American players just play to drive to the basket and
make highlight reel plays.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And how can the Celtics lose 3 home games in a 7 game series where
they have home court advantage??  These are not Bill Russell's
Celtics or Larry Bird's Celtics.  I really think they don't
deserve the uniforms.  Everybody's gotta go.  Walker will never have the
maturity to carry the team to the upper level of the NBA.  And
it's hard to find anybody else on the team to stand behind.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The ultimate result of the corrupt officiating, weak play, and
bad attitudes is hurting the NBA badly.  Some say it's racial, but
it's more than that.  Americans don't like watching spoiled
multimillionaires who give full effort at most half the time.

I agree with your thoughts on the NBA in general, but you do have
to note that TEAMS win the Championships most of the time.
San Antonio is destroying the Suns with Team play and Detroit

<br /><br /><b>More from Rick Desper</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Regarding the NBA, I do think that success at the highest level still
depends on team play.  And that applies to the Celtics' collapse,
too.
The problem is that there is far too much individual reward to
players for individual accomplishments.  And so I think players are
more interested in getting max contracts and lucrative endorsements
than winning.  I know that sounds like a cliche, but I think it's
true.  Rick

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>((Thanks, Rick, and yes, so really you can figure out which four or
five teams have any chance at all at the title as the playoffs start,
and perhaps when the season starts.  Ainge says he's serious about
making the Celtics one of those teams, and I believe him.  The
question is whether he and Rivers can do it.  Expect HUGE battles
of will to make it happen and that's why I think the ex-players
are going to have to be the coaches in the future.  Only a guy
like Doc Rivers who did it, can tell THEM to do it.
That makes Popovich and Brown something of coaching dinosaurs
and I think they know it.
But here they are and one of them wins the finals.
I'd bet on Popovich (and Duncan).
I find it also interesting that each of these teams starts at
least one more or less purely defensive player - and Bruce
Bowen used to be a Celtic, as did Billups, and famously ALMOST
Duncan.... you could make up an All Ex-Celtic Team that could
compete better than the current one.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I also want to say something else about Paul Pierce.  Most
people have forgotten the "stabbing issue" of a few weeks back
where Paul Pierce was stabbed in a bar by a group of rowdies.
You know, it looks to me like he partly suffers from post traumatic
stress disorder that makes him pull away from people and his 
teammates.
I do hope he is getting help and treatment for this, and I really
hope the Celtics don't trade him.
I think he is a good guy and a good player.
BUT, you can't ask him to lead the team, not in any significant way,
since his aloofness, or whatever you want to call it, just doesn't
permit it.
I heard a story recently that at the last All Star game, virtually
NO reporters talked to Pierce.
It wasn't that he was unfriendly when they DID approach him, he
just put on that mask of being unapproachable.
To any of you who suffer from PTSD, you have my sincerest sympathies
it is one of the most life changing things that can happen to the
mind that one can imagine.
And it is insidious in its effects.
So, Danny Ainge, I really want Paul Pierce to be part of the solution
as long as you don't ask him to do things he cannot do, and not
join this crowd of great ex-Celtics.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A while back in <i>TAP</i> I noticed that someone (Goz?) tersely dismissed the
A's as a team unworthy of notice this year.  A month ago I would have
said he put too much stock in the superficial sports columnists who
misread the two big trades as a traditional fire-sale dismantling of
the team instead of the short-horizon retooling that it really was.  We
all knew that Beane was looking more toward 06 than 05, but I still
figured the 05 squad to be a slightly-over-500 team that could be
competitive in a weak division.
<i>((As did I, as did I.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Today, I'd have to eat those words - well, except for the part about
the weak division. The AL West has quickly dropped from arguably the
best division in baseball to arguably the worst.  As of today, the
division as a whole is almost back up to .500, but only because Texas's
recent win streak has been heavily padded by wallopings of
bottom-feeder teams like Houston and Kansas City.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for the A's, they're arguably the worst team in the league now, with
only the Royals even disputing it. It's hard to fathom how much the A's
suck right now. Those who don't follow the team might figure, "Yeah,
well they traded Hudson and Mulder, and Tejada left, too," and leave it
at that, but it's actually quite a bit more complicated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
About half of it has been injuries. There may be another team that has
been whacked as hard, but if so, I don't know it.  We lost three
hitters from our starting lineup (Crosby, Swisher, and Durazo, though
Swisher just came back), the better half of our bullpen, and our
number-one starter.  Nationally, Zito gets more attention, and he
started the first game out of respect for his seniority, but among the
A's cognoscenti it's taken for granted that Rich Harden is the team's
ace now, and Zito is number two.  In the bullpen, other than Bradford,
who has been out since before the season began, only Calero and Dotel
actually went on the DL, but both Cruz and Duchscherer have also been
unavailable for extended periods due to injuries (and both Calero and
Dotel were playing hurt before they went on the DL).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Part of the rationale for the younger team was to be less injury-prone,
not more. Going into the season, the idea was that older teams like the
Giants and Angels would lose some of their starters due to injury (as
indeed they have) but that we wouldn't.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That was one surprise. The other surprise is that among the healthy
players, the supposed stars of the team have been awful. At least at
hitting they have.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The (superficial) conventional wisdom was that, having traded two of
the "big three", the 2005 A's weakness would be pitching. In fact,
pitching has been OK. Even in our huge team slump, the team ERA is
still 4.67, which is not great, but not horrible either (slightly
better than Boston's!). Considering how much the injuries pushed us
down on the depth chart, I'd say it's even a little better than par.
Harden pitched fabulously before he got hurt. Zito had one really bad
outing but otherwise has been OK; his poor W-L record is mainly due to
atrocious run support.  Of the new guys, it was expected that each was
about a 50-50 shot to make the team this year, so when two of the three
(ie, one from each trade plus the latest guy coming through the minors)
did, that was as expected. When those two (Haren and Blanton) did well
at first but then struggled once advance scouting caught up with them,
that was as expected as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What was not expected was that we'd be the worst hitting team by far.
Eric Chavez, supposedly our franchise player, has been atrocious. In
fact, there's only one part of his swing that has a hole, but everyone
knows about it and everyone is pitching him outside. In the past week
there have been signs that he might have finally figured it out, but
only after two months of batting &#126;.200.  Also very very bad is Jason
Kendall. When we traded for him, there were two debates among the
informed segment of the A's fan base. The Moneyball-conscious worried
that even though he's a good player, he wasn't worth the heavy contract
he carried. Another group complained that we need power hitting more
than hitting for average.  What no one expected was that Kendall
wouldn't hit at all. Of the rest, three are hitting OK but not great
(Kotsay, Hatteberg, Ellis), and Bobby Kielty - the fans' least
favorite after a horrible season in 04 - has gone way beyond
expectation to become our best hitter, though on this team that's not
saying much.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Even less forgivable than the terrible offense has been the terrible
defense in the field.  In recent years, A's have been at the top of the
league in defense. Some drop-off was expected, because after letting go
of two groundball pitchers, Beane put less emphasis on infield defense
than in past years. Even so, the whole team is drastically
underperforming on defense. Eric Chavez, of the numerous Gold Gloves,
has been decidedly mediocre on defense this year. Scott Hatteberg,
whose ascent from zero-defense to halfway-decent was documented in
<i>Moneyball</i>, is now playing worse than he ever has. Byrnes and Ginter
were expected to be bad, and they have been. (Byrnes, notwithstanding his
many Web Gems, is a lousy defender, often making a dramatic diving
attempt at what might have been a simple catch if only he had read the
ball right. There's a joke in Oakland that whenever the play-by-play
guy says "it's a routine fly ball to Byrnes", the fans shout back, "No
such thing!") Kendall was also expected to be bad defensively, and he's
been even worse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Among the few bright spots, Houston Street, our 21-year-old
closer-of-the-future, who might well still be in AAA if not for the
injuries in the bullpen, has been excellent, with 2.08 ERA over 26
innings, no HRs allowed, and 2:1 SO/BB ratio. He has no saves yet,
largely because there have been so few leads to be saved. When Dotel
was put on the DL, Street was anointed the closer in his absence. That
was eight games ago, and since then the team has yet to go into the
ninth inning of any game with a lead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other bright spots, um, let's see. Scutaro has exceeded his (low)
expectations. I can't think of any more. This is a very bad team.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm still a fan, though.  I listen to the webcast as often as I can -
not nearly as much as last year, when I followed almost every game, but
still about 50%.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didn't get seriously interested in baseball until late in the 1999
season, so this is my first experience as a fan of a bad team.
Surprisingly, I find that the fact that we're terrible doesn't make
rooting for the team any less enjoyable.

<i>((Hi Mark, I was wondering what you were thinking..... I agree, it
can be just as much fun to watch bad teams.  
I was first a Giants fan, and have been following them closely for almost
forty years now, and a LOT of that was bad teams, especially their famous
June swoons.
Also, in terms of
coming back into contention with a losing team, I always thought
in terms of "ten game winning streaks" as in "if we went on a
ten game winning streak right now... then....".  The A's are
still in "ten game winning streak" hailing distance.
The other guy you didn't mention is Adam Melhuse.  With Kendall
stinking up the joint, I would have thought Melhuse would have
carved out more playing time.  But his weak OBP of last year
turned into his abysmal BA this year.  What, he's batting about
.100?  Less than half his weight and half Mendoza line.
We'll see what happens next, but the AL West has nothing right
now.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark Lew (Tue, 31 May 2005 02:08:15 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You really can't judge Melhuse's hitting this year, since he's gotten 
so little playing time.  Today he came in as a pinch-hitter, got a 
single, and as a result his batting average jumped up about 45 points.  
One more hit and he's back above the Mendoza line.  That doesn't mean 
he's improving dramatically; it just shows how meaningless his current 
average is.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I agree that it's perverse that he hasn't had more playing time.  
Kendall has a reputation as an every day player.  As soon as Kendall 
was signed, Melhuse's agent immediately made noises about wanting a 
trade.  Whatever happened next was behind the scenes, but next thing we 
knew Melhuse was saying pleasantries to the reporters and he was back 
in place as the second-stringer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's all well and good to play Kendall every day if he's hitting, but 
when his hitting was so atrocious (and defense even worse), why not 
give him some days off.  But Macha almost never did.  You have to 
figure this was Beane's idea.  Presumably the idea is that Kendall 
needs time in the AL to get used to the pitching and so long as we wait 
it out and don't give up on him he'll come around, just like Kotsay did 
last year, but it certainly taxes the patience of the fans - and 
presumably Melhuse as well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can see leaving Kendall and Chavez in the lineup, because they're not 
going to get better if they don't get a chance to hit.  What I don't 
understand is keeping them in the 3rd and 4th spot game after game.  I 
know that the importance of batting order is exaggerated.  Even so, you 
still want your best hitters to get more ABs, so you put them at the 
top.  Kendall and Chavez were the worst on the team.  If they're only 
there to get their swings back anyway, why not let them bat 7 and 9?  I 
don't get it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But again, you have to pin the responsibility on Beane.  It's known 
that Beane will sometimes play back-seat manager, and when he insists 
on something Macha will do as he's told.  Either the persisting with 
the perverse lineup (which also has the strange quality of clumping all 
the LH bats at the top and all the RH bats at the bottom) is Beane's 
own idea and Macha is just the middle manager; or if it is Macha's 
idea, then Beane has decided not to intervene and tell him to change it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Today they did finally switch the lineup, moving Kendall to leadoff and 
Kielty into 3rd in front of Chavez, and we won.  They did this once 
before, and it was successful then, too, but then the next day it was 
back to the old lineup with all the slumping lefties on top.  I didn't 
catch the game today, but I assume it was against a LH starter.  That's 
the only time they even consider shaking up the lineup, because it 
means moving Byrnes up.  Byrnes has dramatic splits, hitting very well 
against LH and terrible against RH.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, the trade speculation I'm getting behind sends Ginter and 
Byrnes to San Diego for Xavier Nady.  Nady is a young hitter who 
simultaneously addresses the A's lack of RH power and still fits the 
Beane profile of a patient hitter. (He's also a N Calif native, which 
Beane consistently prefers.)  San Diego likes Nady, too, but the theory 
is that given how he's currently being used, Byrnes is nearly as useful 
to them.  Padres have three LH starters they like in the outfield, 
which leaves Nady to bounce around as second-string for whoever needs a 
day off. (He also covers 1B or 3B.)  They mostly use him against LH 
pitching anyway, so for that purpose Byrnes could equal Nady, even 
though he's not as good a player generically.  To equalize the 
downgrade, San Diego gets Ginter at 2B.  They need someone to fill in 
at 2B while Mark Loretta is hurt, but they don't want to go big bucks 
for someone like Polanco or Kaz Matsui, so that makes 
Ginter/Ellis/Scutaro a plausible alternative.  Now that Crosby is back 
from the DL, Beane has one more middle infielder than he needs. Ginter 
is the one we'd most like to trade, but if San Diego asked for Ellis or 
Scutaro instead, I think that might be negotiable as well.  Padres have 
injuries at both 2B and 3B right now, and they're playing 
second-stringers in both spots.  They're looking to contend this year, 
so even though they don't want to do a major signing, I don't think 
they're going to leave the hole unaddressed either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My commentary on your editorial regarding the Iraqi elections, 
Ahmed Chalabi and `press corps investigative journalism' begins with the 
last mentioned. 
Isn't this, if you mean `white house press corps investigative 
journalism' an oxymoron? Canadians get plenty of White House news bites 
on our nightly news and since this is `main stream' entrenched interest 
commercial news it is mostly `pablum news' for the masses. The result 
being a lot of ignorance (those who uncritically believe what they are 
told) and apathy (those who despair the lack of investigative journalism 
in the mainstream news).
<i>((You correctly identify that I was using a bit of sarcasm in that
phrase... or maybe you didn't see it...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I understand Ahmed Chalabi to be an American appointee and, 
reputedly, a somewhat unscrupulous businessman. Whether he is 
investigated by American authorities (on whatever charge) is likely 
immaterial to his perceived `Quisling' status by other Iraqis. Chalabi 
is a minor concern.
<i>((I do seriously disagree,  but time will tell.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With regard to the elections, firstly, I am sure this is 
welcomed by the majority of Iraqis, especially the Kurds in the north 
and the Shia in the south. The real question is whether the Insurgency 
will peter out or will it continue? The Kurds want their own nation, 
which they were given assurance they would get after World War One. How 
will Iran, Turkey and Syria view this, especially Turkey? The Shia in 
the south wield the most power and are numerically the largest 
population. How the Sunnis of central Iraq will be accommodated 
considering recent history is still problematic. American military 
planners predicted intervention in Iraq would be for a minimum of four 
years (if my recollection is correct). Maybe it will be longer now. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two views of Iraq dominate the popular perception at the 
present time. One is the American government administration/military 
view which is rather uncritically parroted by the mainstream commercial 
media to wit - we are winning the `war' (read police action) in Iraq, 
the Terrorists (read insurgents) are losing and life in Iraq getting 
better. This is what too many Americans believe, who, unfortunately, 
have limited access to alternative views as to what is really going on. 
The second view, held by a majority of people from most of the other 
western democracies, is that the American intervention in Iraq was 
poorly planned (witness the widespread invasion looting), that the 
American intervention was illegal under international law (witness the 
outright lie about weapons of mass destruction) that it is not 
surprising that Iraqis are fighting an American invasion (one person's 
terrorist is anther person's freedom fighter) and is life getting better 
for Iraqis? I imagine it depends on who you ask.
<i>((It does, and you're being way too general and extreme.
There are all sorts of views here between those two.
I am closer to the second, for example, but not there.
And I freely admit I've not been to Iraq and can't really comment
in detail on what things are like there.
I like to listen to non-American foreigners who have.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The American miltary intervention in Iraq is an Imperialist 
intervention and is primarily about MONEY for the American corporate 
military/industrial complex. The second benefit is a military presence 
in the Middle East to secure access to the oil (the prelude was Kuwait &amp; 
Iraq, Saudi Arabia is the next concern - how neat it all fits). The one 
benefit that the American government espouses that they are providing to 
the Iraqi people (and that all people can agree on) is democracy. How 
beneficial to the American government propaganda effort (to garner 
domestic support). The question is - Is the cost to bring `democracy' to 
Iraq worth the price that will eventually have to be paid? I think not.
<i>((If you think this, and again a bit more extremely than I think,
then again you must be more worried about what Ahmed Chalabi's continuing
role is and what is he doing as "Acting" Oil Minister.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The American government's contention that Saddam Hussein's Iraq 
was a dangerous so-called `Rogue State' is dubious. The Israelis 
destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981. Then American 
intelligence propped up Saddam's regime throughout the eighties during 
the ill-advised Iraqi conflict with Iran. Then the Iraqi army was 
rendered toothless during the first `Gulf War' in 1991. Finally, it is 
obvious to any intelligent individual that the American and British 
governments outright lied to their people and to the World about weapons 
of mass destruction in the possession of Iraq. The government excuse is 
that it was an "intelligence failure". The only intelligence failure is 
if an individual believes that lie.  The only people in denial about this 
are the ignorant individuals who fail to check the facts for themselves. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Amongst others, Iran and North Korea are deemed to be `Rogue 
States' by the George W Bush administration. Iran is, unfortunately, run 
by a conservative and fundamentalist Islamic regime. Surprise, the 
United States of America is run by a conservative and (arguably) a 
fundamentalist Christian regime. They both have elections too. The 
question here is - does Iran, as a sovereign state, have the right to 
pursue nuclear weapons capability? When we examine North Korea we see it 
is a communist and atheistic regime, quite a different polity 
altogether. Again the question is posed - does North Korea, as a 
sovereign state, have the right to pursue nuclear weapons capability?  
The answer, unsurprisingly, is yes. North Korea already claims nuclear 
weapons capability. Iran is accused of pursuing this capability.
Which of these states, therefore, is the more dangerous?
<i>((You also have to put the whole equation together, and I do think
the Bush Administration has more of this right than you claim, and note
that it is North Korea's capability that precisely makes it a harder
target.
You have to balance risk and reward, not just "rank badness" on one
scale and go for it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Iraq, falsely accused of possessing `weapons of mass 
destruction' and being illegally invaded by the United States of America 
et al was a state with a decent standard of living, albeit ruled by a 
tyrant. Now it is a fractured state with festering wounds (a rhetorical 
flourish here).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why was Iraq invaded by the United States of America but North 
Korea was not? Could it be because Iraq has oil (and is close to plenty 
more plus the place is flat) while North Korea has nothing (and is 
mountainous besides)? Could it be because the Iraqi army was already 
non-existent and Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction while North 
Korea has a huge army and maybe does have nuclear weapons? To a critical 
eye this is analogous to a teenager who bullies a toddler rather than an 
older child who could fight back. 
<i>((Perhaps, but you're imposing a value judgment.
Perhaps the bully doesn't want to have someone fight back with dangerous power.
And so that's what the bully does.
It makes no sense to "predict wrongly" that the bully will hit the older,
stronger child.
It MAY make sense, upping this by a level (TM, Patent Pending), to berate
the bully as a wimp to try to engage an emotional reaction.
But even there, you have to be careful about what you're trying to do,
and if the bully is inured to insults, it will be ineffective.))</i>         

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The United States of America is the Rogue State. Furthermore, 
George W Bush and his senior adminisitration officials, in particular 
(but not necessarily confined to)  Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul 
Wolfowitz, Condoleeza Rice and all those who espoused and defended the 
invasion of Iraq, in my opinion, are and should be charged in an 
international court of law, as War Criminals. A last unsurprising fact 
considering the above, the USA refuses to recognize the legitimacy of 
the International Court of Justice in the Hague and of the associated 
War Crimes Tribunal to have jurisdiction over American citizens. 
Surprise, surprise. 
<i>((No surprise, no surprise, is this the way you play Diplomacy,
failing to account for another power's "interests in its own eyes"?
Not good....))</i>

see Rip's subszine elsewhere in most issues of <i>TAP</i>.
Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have a new game start below.
I am willing to open another new game if there is enough interest!!!
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.
We have Karl Schmit on the list, let's get seven!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly or you can look at them at
www.variantbank.org.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'll try to remember to punch in the rules in the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough and Bruce Edwards are interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Harold Reynolds has been running the game of Colonia 
and is interested in guest-GMing a game of Aberration.
Sean O'Donnell and Brendan Whyte are interested in Aberration.
Brendan and Sean BOTH need rules from Harold Reynolds.
And since Colonia is over, Harold is looking to start something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, Dave Partridge, and Eric Ozog are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, the other Modern game
is now done!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll be taking over Phil Reynolds' two regular Diplomacy games somewhere in <i>TAP</i>.
One or both games might go to Harold Reynolds' subszine, since Colonia is over.
I have Phil's last issue, #44, but that was published way back in December of 
2003.
I'm not sure if people have moved or whatever in that time, so a little help would
be appreciated.
And I hope everyone comes back, but I might need some standbys.
I am STILL not hearing from too many of you!!! 
I'm going to start nagging so I can get these restarted.
Please let me know if you care playing, thanks to Karl Schmit for responding
each time that he's in....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England), 
John Power (Germany), Tim Snyder (Italy), and Fred Wiedemeyer (Russia)
are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.
Paul Risner probably is not going to be able to continue in the game.

(ITALIAN GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT to ALL):  Sorry about the lack of communication, 
in the last 2 weeks my wife has found out the need of and had done a heart cath. 
I am very thankful to say it was negative. But that leaves us still to explain 
the chest pains. Then her father (her parents live beside us) had a pacemaker put
in. So it's been an eventful 2 weeks full of a different kind of stress
than I am used to. Now that the bad stuff is past I can get back to a 
more normal routine.

1) Neutral Sweden FINALLY is overwhelmed by the English hordes.
It stayed neutral until the end of 1904, that's a record as far
as I've ever seen.
Anyone else see Sweden or any other neutral stay empty for so long??
And Russia takes a home center back and survives....

(STAR TREK PRESS - EPISODE 7 - "Truth is Stranger then Fiction"):
A Conversation Kirk (K) and Spock (S)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Report, Spock!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: We have good news, great news, really really great news to report.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Did the Tribbles take the bait?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: They did, Captain.
We won a battle in the Tribble neutral zone causing one Tribble starship
to withdraw, and they walked into Deep Space 6 as planned.
They can't hold it long enough to use its resources and the starship
"Structured Corruption" is now within range of the Tribbles first
military colony on the fringe of the Neutral Zone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Sweet!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: It gets better, the Tribbles, the Children of Tamari, and the 
(this is too good to be true!) Romulans have attacked the Breen.
With the Tribbles trapped on Deep Space 6, they can't defend their
homeworld.
The Breen can just walk in or if they don't, they're nuts.
On top of that, if the Tribbles retreat to defend homeworld,
we can advance or at least hold our own.
The only question is...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: What will the Federation and the Romulans do on our "other"
front?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: If they don't attack, we don't have another front.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Cool!
I'm wondering Spock, the attack on the Breen by the Tribbles doesn't
make any sense.
If they had waited just a little longer they could have held Deep Space 6,
now, even with Federation help they couldn't hold it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: According to an intercept of a Tribble subspace message, the 
Tribble commander is away on a pilgrimage.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Maybe he is looking for his "pau".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: He's a Tribble, not a Bejoran.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Well, I wish him all the best, but I hope we can take advantage of his
absence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S: Agreed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Now in Sick Bay, later in the day, Kirk talking to Dr. McCoy(M))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Any luck in your attempt to change us back into human form?  I hate
being a Ferengi.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M: Actually, I have a theory but I have to try it on one of us.
7 of 9 has agreed to let me "experiment on her".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: I always wanted to be a doctor.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M: Wish me luck!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K: Can I watch???
(McCoy rolls his eyes and walks away)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): John Boardman sent me his szine.
Its main theme is the evil of patriotism.
I of course "had to respond".
He ended up giving me the "Colin Ferguson Award" of the month
for conservative stupidity (should I be proud or angry?)
<i>((If I were you, I'd be proud, it does put you in some
pretty mixed company, but John's szine is the hobby's original
szine.
This all is pretty well known for people who've been getting the szine
for 20 years or so like I have.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I told Mr. Boardman that he did have some good points but that there are
plenty of examples, World War II for example, where patriotism was justified.
He responded by telling me he has no interest in a dialog with someone as 
"insane" as me.
The guy mails me three szines, but claims he's not interested in a dialog.
<i>((Well, if he's not interested in an exchange of ideas and isn't willing
to change his mind on anything, that actually does make sense.))</i>
He never directly responded to a single point I ever made.
The man is obviously intelligent but he is also arrogant and mean and even
dangerous.
I was just curious if you knew him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KARL-SEAN): Saying the Colonial map is better than the Modern
map really makes me want to never try Modern.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to KARL): Or, you could go with everyone else I've ever heard
comment on the two after playing them.... Modern's map is way, way better
than Colonial's.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to SEAN): How's married life treating you?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): Wait a sec, Sean is married and he didn't tell us???
Wow, it seems like yesterday that he was still in high school.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ANKARA-DENMARK via SILESIA): A summit was held in Sevastopol and many
plans were hatched.  The Russian leaders were invited, unfortunately
there were none nearby to be found.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I disagree, I like the Star Wars prequel.
Nicely done in my opinion.  
I think the Star Trek prequel was a good concept, just poorly written.
I'm still trying to figure out why John Boardman's zine has not
been cancelled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): You're certainly entitled to your opinion and lots
of people agree with you.
I also agree that the worst part of Enterprise was the writing,
especially how Vulcans were portrayed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GENE RODDENBERRY to THE PARAMOUNT NETWORK): Of course "Enterprise"
sucks.
I'm still dead!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is just barely ahead of this pace).
And Dennis and Rick have precisely the same number of replenishment points,
but very different outcomes with those points.
And Karl leaps out to a COMMANDING lead in replenishment, now he needs to
go, go, go and get these guys over the finish line and earn some POINTS!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to GM):  What's with this game?  I NMR two turns in a row and still come in
first!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GM): As I discovered in the other game, having the first rider across
the line is NOT winning the race..... the Gold Trophy goes to the TEAM that
wins!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to DESPERATE RICK):  Hey!  Congratulations!  You got the gold trophy this
time out!  I'm going to grab the bronze: then I'll have a complete matched set.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KARL to BOOB): Replenishments are overrated!  Rick should have 
this game as Homer looks to be the 2nd across the finish line.  Not 
having looked at it too closely, I think I should have another amazing 
turn for replenishments but the best finish I could hope for would be 
grabbing 4th through 7th places.  Perhaps early replenishments are key? 
Or maybe one team doesn't usually grab a nearly insurmountable lead 
most of the time...  anyway, I'll get y'all in Tinamou!
<i>((I've found that the way Rick grabbed that lead is almost 
unprecedented.
But you know those mathematicians, he probably had some complex
differential equation model with Bayesian posterior distributions
tacked on that solved the whole thing out for him.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOULDER to SILT):  You are going to let Omega finish last, aren't you???!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SILT): We'll see who catches up to Bart, won't we???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TOM to JIM-BOB): On your efficiency score, you going to subtract the cards left
in the players hand at the end?  You should at least count those up and figure
some kind of "Wastage Score"...  &lt; g &gt; 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to TOM): I wasn't going to, but that is a good idea.  
It partly will explain why Karl has more replenishments at the end, but won't win.
Most of you probably can figure out how this all ends up, but let's play it out!
(Tom has placed his educated prediction)
