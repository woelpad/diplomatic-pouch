<br /><br />As I finish up the szine, the hated Yankees are completing their loss to the Marlins.
I don't really feel like gloating about this, I only am relieved that I don't have
to eat CROW with Goz over the Yankees winning.
More on this below (probably TOO much more on this below), but let's say up top that
ANY season in a US professional league where the team with the 21st ranked payroll 
wins its league championship CANNOT be said to be a league where money always wins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Baseball has been one reason why the szine has been horribly delayed.
Work has been another.
The giant project that creeped my work week up toward 60 hours per is over.
And I'm slowly picking up the pieces of my life from the last eight months.
This has been hell, pure and simple, and what little free time I had didn't
have me feeling like doing this szine, but this weekend I finally got excited
about it again..... and we have GAME STARTS, we have GAME STARTS!!
See below.
I think we also have a full complement of subszines from Dave Partridge, 
Richard Weiss, Rip Gooch, Michael Lowrey, and Harold Reynolds.
And lastly, I've spent a lot of time counting ballots for the 2003 Diplomacy 
Hobby Awards.
The winners follow immediately below, the Committee decided that no one would
be awarded the 2003 Kathy Byrne Caruso Award for Lifetime Achievement,
starting the precedent that it need not be awarded every year.

<b>The 2003 Diplomacy Hobby Awards</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The 2003 Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service goes to Chad Schroeder for
running the Redscape diplomacy playing system - http://www.redscape.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The 2003 Rod Walker Award for Literary Achievement goes to Paul Windsor
for the article "Persuasive Illogic", in The Diplomatic Pouch 2002 Fall Movement -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/Zine/F2002M/Windsor/Persuasive_Illogic.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The 2003 John Koning Award for Player Performance goes to Yann Clouet who led 
the Diplomatic Pouch Tournament Ratings at 2002 Year End -
http://diplom.org/Face/DPTR/AllRatings.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The 2003 Fred Hyatt Award for GM Performance goes to Christine Stoy who is a
Redscape and WorldMasters GM - http://www.redscape.net/magazine/issue1_gmchristine.php 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please join me in congratulating all of the winners, who have been sent their 
plaques by Fred Davis, Jr., who is preparing to retire as the Committee Treasurer.
From now on, unless I have another volunteer, I'll be doing the Plaques.
Even though the voting period was shorter, there were more voters this year (nearly 100)
and nearly all of the nominees received significant support.  Yet, the winners all
stood out and won decisively.  The Diplomacy Hobby Awards Committee currently consists 
of myself (Chair), Fred Davis (Treasurer), Gary Behnen, Melinda Holley, Jamie Dreier, 
Paul Kenny, Mark Stretch, and Robert Lesco. 
Fred will step down as Treasurer, but remain a member.
I thank all the members of the Committee for assisting with support and in the nomination
process.
Next year, I am going to start the balloting much earlier, with a closing date of July 1, 2004.
Then the Awards will be announced at World DipCon in Birmingham, England, which I plan to 
attend. 
It is not too early to send 2004 nominations to me, as well as any comments, questions, 
or donations.
Also, if anyone wants on or off the Committee, that also would be appropriate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Congratulations again to these people and ALL of the nominees who work so hard to keep this
hobby going and keep up the fun.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />We have a new game of Regular Diplomacy about ready to start.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, Matt Sundstrom, Fred Wiedemeyer, Karl Schmit,
Don Williams, and Alexandre Levinson should be all set to play.
I want to give one last chance to submit preference lists (recall according to
my house rules they will be random unless I get them from everyone)
and any of you that haven't paid the gamefee (see below) should pay NOW!
Also we've got a full game of Breaking Away (which is free), get me your setups for
that NOW!
With the delay, I'm pushing deadlines back to reasonable dates, and lining things up for
Christmas.  
If you have ANY doubts over whether I have your orders on file, please ask!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

<div class="p"><!----></div>
David Wang still has the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still at least one opening, you can start RIGHT NOW to play next year!
The World Series is coming up next week between Milwaukee and Texas, so
play in our league does NOT align well with real baseball.
It isn't like a regular fantasy league, it's completely unique.
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR STEVE HEINOWSKI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's time to start another one of these, and someone asked me
recently, does anyone know where Steve Heinowski is?
He probably still lives in the same house in Ohio where
he always lived, but you HAVE to get him to write a letter
to me to win.
You're nuts if you think ***I*** will tell you what I 
think that address might be.
Steve always was a bit slow on the technological uptake,
so he probably doesn't have E-Mail.
But that should be a good challenge.
You have until issue #280 to find him for the fifty buck prize.
This makes TWO missing ex-Boardman Number Custodians that we're
trying to find.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

I received the following exchange from Egg (Egbert Ferreira) and Toby Harris.
I make no claims on whether it makes any sense, but to be fair, Egg is 
Brazilian and English is not his first language.
And yes, any board with the two of them on it MUST be some kind of board of death!!

An Ode to an Egg, by Toby Harris</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Humpty Numpty sat on his wall, with allies aplenty, puppets `n' all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He sailed his fleets to Swe via Den, but one year later he lost it again!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
His bullshit profound, he’d say "Hey Toby! I’ll take the Lowlands, you take Nairobi."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He chuckled and laughed with the hun on his side. Humpty was having a real swell ride. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But then one day Humpty got bitten by his pup: out of the blue a new F(Kie) popped up!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Poor Humpty’s plots and plans had been foiled, for the time had come for the egg to be boiled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Four minutes for soft, ten for hard, the egg shell had cracked, taken off guard.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The moral dear friend, dear friend, dear friend, is don’t send your allies around the bend. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Humpty dealt too much shit and constantly lied and now it is time for the egg to be fried. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So the Worldmasters continues with glittering trophies, and the winners, the glory, 
the players... the Tobies :-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The weakies all gone, as well as the numpties. So wipe that tear from your eye 
as you bid adios to Humpty.

Egg, I thought you knew. There is no "Humpty Numpty", 
but there is a character called "Humpty Dumpty", 
which I changed to reflect the sign of our Diplomacy times with Numpties. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Humpty was a fine character ;-) He is also .... an egg !!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He is a children's nursery rhyme character and the rhyme goes:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All the king's horses and all the king's men

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Couldn't put Humpty together again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Soooooo, what with you being an "egg","Humpty Numpty" being rather 
fitting for our game, and what I believe to be maybe not so much a "fall" 
but more of a hiccup in our game ... it all seemed to fit. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just a shame you didn't understand it !!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Bollocks", I already explained. 
I don't know the Portuguese equivalent but believe in Spanish it's "Cochonas". 
If you need further explanation, it's that little collection of dangly balls 
in your trousers ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, I can't stay here gossiping to you Numpties all nite ... 
I've got some serious Diplomacy to do to win over a new-found ally ;-) 
Egg, he now wants me to support him into NTH! What will you do about that I wonder?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As before, I'll give you an olive branch if you want it ... 
but you'll need to succumbre to trusting me to give you second place. 
You should trust me really ...

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.
Check these out if you like:

Nice of them to make BOTH of these available.

As we tried to get together last Fall's issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.
I've heard almost nothing on this lately, so it is getting close to going away,
but who knows, someone may get frisky.
Nothing new yet.

<br /><br /><b>Bernie or Buddy Tretick (Sun, 28 Sep 2003 14:37:34 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hey!  Gee, guy! There just has to be at least one vote for the infamous 
Buddy Tretick, aka Bernie Oaklyn, who just happened to live on Oaklyn 
Drive [so what!].  Gee, golly, gosh, I am sure Jim Tretick [are you sure 
you are my son, Jim?], and probababababableeee, the other Jim who is not 
sure of ... Burgess, himselflessness.
<i>((As always, I bow before your wisdom and tradition.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After all, was it not Buddy Tretick that fueled the fires of hell in Rod 
Walker for so many decades, and who besmirched the smirch on that rude 
host, Fred Hyatt for more and more decades.  Was it not Buddy Tretick, 
aka Bernie Oaklyn, who kept all of those legal weenies trying to prove 
or disprove one way or the other who was whom, or whom was who.
<i>((Indeed, I think everyone is more relaxed these days.
Note all the people on my sublist (including Rod Walker....).))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wasn't it Bernie Oaklyn, aka Buddy Tretick, who had the most organized 
gamezine ever?  Yeah, yeah, that includes Jim-Bob-Boy's gamezines, or 
doesn't necessarily disclude those gamezines that are stuck solid to the 
glue on a clamped envelope that is, shall we say, brown in color.
<i>((Well, it was pretty darn well organized, and FAR better 
organized than mine.
More than that, I shall not say.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Come on, Jim!  I have a right to have fun at anyone's expense.  I 
survived 8 twisters over this past summer, all right next door to my 
subdivision [no, I don't mean down the center of my head!].  I survived 
a flooded basement.  And, I was [just last week] rear ended once more, 
and hurt a bit I might add.  And, over four years, had ten trees drop 
down and barely miss my house.
<i>((Maybe you should be more proactive about tree cutting.... ;-) 
Or maybe not.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sure, you can publish all of that with my blessings.

"The Rundown" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Rock rocks.  "The Rundown" is an action movie with actual humor instead 
of the lame one-liners one usually hears.  The Rock, who is billed that way in 
the credits, has all the moves, the physic, and an actual personality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pretty simple story.  "Beck" (The Rock) is a retrieval expert.  Considering 
the people for whom he works, leg breaker is as accurate a description of his 
job.  He works for a bookie and he collects outstanding debts.  He is in hock 
to the bookie himself, so he is actually working to reduce his own debt rather 
than for any real gain. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He is sent to Brazil deep into the Amazon Jungle to retrieve `Travis' (Seann 
William Scott) the son of the Bookie.  This isn't a family thing exactly.  The 
kid has made some serious enemies, and his father plans to turn him in to 
curry favor.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, The Rock goes into the jungle, where he finds a slave labor camp, 
rebels, wild animals, and `Travis'.  When he first asks for directions to 
`Travis' he is advised to "Follow the trail of bullshit, the kid never stops 
talking."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Really great fight scenes.  The fact that The Rock is a professional wrestler 
doesn't hurt.  Her knows how to make a fight look real.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Steve, Steflan of aol.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, I've been seeing all of the Rock movies and appreciating his
development as a great action movie star.
I say that even though I never ever watch professional wrestling and the
first time I ever saw the Rock was in a movie, and I had no idea who he was.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Steve Langley</b> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Once Upon the Time in Mexico" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a "Robert Rodriguez Flick".  It says so in the titles.  "Shot,
Chopped, and Scored by" seems to me there were a couple other credits as well -
Written by - Directed by -  He even wrote the song over the closing credits. 
Now the man has a great light side.  The "Spy Kids" movies attest to that. 
Turns out he also has a dark side. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I first saw him in his dark side in the movie "Desperado".  In it he brought
back "El Mariachi" (Antonio Banderas) the legendary Mexican gunfighter.  In
"Once Upon a Time" Banderas returns again as the mythic Mexican gunfighter.  I
think you get raised from legendary to mythic by being killed, and living
through it.  In both movies some of the best action scenes are from stories told
about "El", not directly from the story being told by the movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story is too complicated to follow exactly.  There are three groups of
police or government agents.  Some of these are honest, some not, some it is
hard to say.  There is a good government official, and his right hand man who is
bad, a Mexican general who is very bad, the head of a drug cartel, his
underling, and a whole bunch of cannon fodder from all sides.  And, of course, El
Mariachi and his side men, who play guitar and automatic weapons.  All have their
own agendas and when they collide there is action and double crosses and
triple crosses.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best in show goes to Johnny Depp who plays `Sanders' the psycho CIA agent who
has masterminded the entire thing.  Well, more or less, turns out he is being
played as well.  Like I said, complicated story.  Lots of action, lots of gun
fights, lots of incredible stunts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Mystic River" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There really is a river named Mystic.  The book takes its name from the 
river, probably because it is such a cool name.  The book is a very complex study 
of character, mostly from the inside.  That is to say, there is a lot of 
internal thought process.  The characters are all wound up in their own internal 
worlds.  Not the easiest book to turn into a movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Somehow Clint Eastwood managed to do so.  He had to suggest pages of internal 
argument with the facial expressions of his actors.  There is a lot of pain, 
a lot of anger, a lot of hurt portrayed here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story starts when one of three friends, not yet teens, is taken off in a 
car by two sexual predators.  His body manages to escape them several days 
later.  His mind escaped sooner.  The person who grew up in the body kept himself 
separate from the boy who escaped the wolves.  He liked to tell his own son 
the story of the boy who escaped the wolves.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One of the other two grew up to go to prison, taking the fall alone rather 
than ratting on his friends.  The third grew up to be a cop.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Twenty seven years later the 19 year old daughter of the ex-con is murdered.  
Unraveling the killing brings the three back together.  They each have their 
own story. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sean Penn plays `Jimmy' the ex-con who sort of runs the neighborhood.  He has 
his own business, employees, friends, and the old gang that he led still look 
to him for leadership.  Sean Penn does some amazing acting in the roll.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tim Robbins plays `Dave' the abused one.  Despite being the largest of the 
three leads he manages to make himself the weakest and least assertive person on 
screen.  Some more amazing acting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kevin Bacon plays `Sean' the kid who grew up to be a cop.  He does a great 
job, but suffers in comparison to the other two.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Laurence Fishburne plays `Whitey Powers', Sean's detective partner.  Whitey 
is an old time Irish cop.  He likes Dave for the murder.  His attempts to get 
evidence against Dave muddies the case.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Great acting, good plot.  Eastwood has the touch.

latest <i>TAP</i> about wanting "good trailers"  was echoed at the Q&amp;A after the
showing. The writer/director (Tim McCanlies) received a question about why
there is a scene in the trailer that doesn't appear in the movie (it was
cut as being redundant, in the final edit as an earlier, similar, scene
conveyed the message). He responded that the folks who put the trailers
together get access to ALL the filmed scenes and (apparently) put the
trailers together before the movie has finished editing. In fact, I had the
impression that this trailer was completed before they even finished
filming (in April the ending was reshot due to test audience reaction -
McCanlies feels that this ending is better). The upshot is the people
putting together the trailer are only interested in filling seats (i.e. use
the best shots to entice folks in) and do their work independently of the
film makers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for the film, it is certainly one for the entire family. Though it is
listed as PG, it is just over the G level - as I recall, one off-color
word, minor violence (contextually necessary), use of guns and some
"dream-like" sequences of battles, sword play and such. It is a wonderful
coming of age story with a withdrawn youth dropped off at his two uncles'
house - who he's never met - to spend the summer. How he grows and slowly
discovers what they have done in the past (mixed with rumors and stories)
is the theme, and it is artfully done with touching scenes and humorous
turns. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the premiere, and the after party, not only was McCanlies (also directed
Dancer, TX) accepting accolades from the theater goers, but he expressed a
bit of worry that the movie wouldn't pull in audiences. He stressed that
the movie is really for "everyone" but that movie marketing doesn't really
know how to handle that angle. They are good at marketing for specific
interested (i.e. horror films, action, etc) but, without that hook, they
have trouble putting together an effective marketing campaign. Overall,
though, he does seem optimistic about the film's success.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other "headliner" at the premiere and after party was Haley Joel Osment
(the young lead, to Michael Caine and Robert Duvall). He had a number of
good stories about the movie, including when the pig went for his throat,
and was really down-to-earth. Unlike a number of child actors, moving into
more adult roles, he seems to be picking the roles he wants and not just
trying to earn money, capitalizing on his reputation. One thing he pointed
out at the Q&amp;A was that he looks for roles that are different to help
stretch his skills rather than doing the same type of character time and
again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you see the movie, let me know what you think.

<i>((Here was my immediate response by E-Mail to Andy: 
Thanks, I'll definitely see it!  It's been on my list for awhile.
Last night I saw two really good trailers that are the exception
that proves the rule.....
One had just an overhead shot circling a bar for Mystic River
that really made me want to see the movie even though there
were NO people and NO dialogue in it.  The other was for a 
romantic comedy (I forget the name of it so I'm sure this
shoots my argument in the foot) where they had lots of what
seemed like random vignettes.  I couldn't tell order or plot
from it at all!  That was good.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And now, after seeing the movie.
I did like the ending the way they did it as I saw it.
I do think, though, that the "facts" of the endings of movies
are not as important as directors and executives make them out to be.
After a LONG sequence of seeing some really putrid summer movies
(like the Hulk and a number of others that I luckily can't even
recall at the moment)... there are much better movies out there this fall!
I haven't seen Mystic River quite yet, but it's out.
Next up, we have Ian Moore, who happens to date his letter on my

<br /><br /><b>Ian Moore (29-9-2003)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim!
I've decided it's high time I dashed off another letter to your szine.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It was interesting to read how some mickey mouse electronic voting 
software is being introduced in the USA.
<i>((It's interesting how that excited people.
Somewhere in here I'll slip in some more about it if people want to 
know more.
It is unfortunate that life in the US is so complex these days that
things can be "exposed" that don't bear the light of day well at
all, but people just don't pay attention long enough to do anything
about them.
I must reluctantly include myself in this.
I don't do anything about these things.
Our society over here, in some scary and fundamental ways, is 
turning into a society of whiners - I believe you call in whinging,
and why is that again? - this works from the top [George Bush whining
that no one seems to understand the compassion in his foreign policy
approach.... really, he means it] down to our children who probably 
have far too much of their whining catered to.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Our elections look like they're going down a similar road, with paper
ballots due to be replaced by electronic voting at the next election.
The system is not open source, so we've only the software vendor's
word for it that the system works and isn't vulnerable to hacking or 
manipulation.
I'm dead against electronic voting.
I think it's a fundamentally bad thing to switch from a transparent
system like paper ballots to something so opaque.
In the USA, are these machine running Diebold software likely
to be used everywhere, or just in some states and cities?
<i>((First of all, our systems on these sorts of things are
highly decentralized, so you can be pretty sure that there won't
be just one system or standard.
One of the mysteries of IT is why society (and it is true absolutely
everywhere, ubiquitous in every business and setting) allows the IT
people to be a community unto themselves which then dictates that the
proprietary software that they write for any system must be used and
probably can't talk to other systems.
If you want a system to talk to another system, you get more smoke
and mirrors, and another system that does nothing except transfer
the data between the systems.  
Expect this to happen with the voting data.
Yet, as you hint, the real issue is much deeper than that.
IBM has been working to try to understand these fundamental relationships
with IT, data, and technology.
Of course, they are highly unlikely to break down the status quo which
brings them much of their profits, but to their credit they are at least
trying to understand it better.
It is a simple but real truth, that a drive for "accurate data", handed
over to IT people to solve, is sure to ignore some essential aspect of
the context or communities in the situation and end up not meeting the
needs or requirements set out at the beginning.
I think it's very important (see reluctance above) that the fault lies
in ourselves, not the usually very earnest and hard working IT people.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile, Brendan Whyte mentions the film "Balzac and the Little Chinese
Seamstress".
I'm sorry I missed this film, as I tend to like Chinese movies.
Is that one directed by the same guy who did "The Blue Kite"?
I liked that a lot.
That "Nowhere in Africa" film sounds interesting too.
I think it either has been and gone here without registering it,
or it never made it here in the first place.
Oh well.
<i>((Have you gotten the new Cate Blanchett movie about your little
town yet?
I found "Veronica Guerin" to be fascinating in both the look around
the edges of your town and in Cate's acting - she's one of the few 
people who really bury herself in roles, so much so that she's actually
better when she doesn't lead a movie like she does here.
The movie making style and directorial choices I liked a little less well
at times, but at least it wasn't overtly manipulative like the standard
Hollywood film is.
For those that haven't seen it or heard about it, I'll only say that
Dublin has a dark side and keeping with some of the themes here, when
people try to expose that dark side, those people don't take kindly
to being exposed.
And the battle to get people to pay attention to what you're exposing
is still a battle in Ireland too, isn't it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And John Harrington mentions the Right Said Fred album (er, their 
first one, they have at least one other).
That's an enjoyable record, I seem to recall.
Did they only have the one hit over in the USA?
<i>((Yeah, and I don't think I ever heard the whole album, OR the second one.))</i>
That means you missed "Deeply Dippy", which I think might have been an even
bigger hit than "I'm Too Sexy".
It's a gorgeous love song, primarily acoustic, the kind of one you'd sing
to a loved one on your anniversary or something.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's nice to see his further comments reigniting the old Blur v. Oasis thing.
My dislike of Blur 
<i>((You dislike Blur?!?!?!?!))</i>
is primarily down to a dislike of Damon Albarn as a human being, but
Blur are obviously a better band than Oasis.
<i>((I don't really know, since the only two things I know for sure
that Damon is responsible for are the lyrics ["He's a 20th century boy,
with his hands on the rails; Trying not to be sick again and holding on
for tomorrow." is OK - from "For Tomorrow" on <b>Modern Life is 
Rubbish</b> - but songs like "She's so High" off <b>Leisure</b> that go
on and on with "She is so high I want to crawl all over her, she doesn't
help me, she is so high.... etc." repetition
can get annoying to be sure] and the singing [which I do adore tremendously].
He does play spots of keyboards - I really like his Solina Organ fills
on the aforementioned "For Tomorrow"accentuating all those cool minor
chord shifts (they actually list all the chords in the lyrics here, which
is strange since all of their other covers are so minimalist).
BUT, if he is responsible for the generally atrocious CD covers then
I might agree.
I don't pay any attention to Damon as a person, I'm not sure I've
ever seen him interviewed.))</i>
It's amazing that the latter are still going - I have real difficulty
imagining why anyone would still be buying their later releases.
<i>((I've always had real difficulty imagining why anyone would ever
have bought any of their releases, so I'm the wrong one to ask....))</i>
What do you make of the new post-Graham Coxon Blur album?
<i>((Hmmm, I've missed it, I suspect that they'd miss his guitarwork
a lot.
Though perhaps I'd be wrong.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I haven't seen "Terminator 3" because it all sounded a bit pointless,
but I was amused by Tim Miller's description of Schwartzenegger as
"ever reliable".
My own experience is that any film in which he has a speaking part
is one to be avoided.
It must be great living in California where there's a good 
chance he could become the next Governor.
<i>((Which now of course has already happened, while I
agree with the sentiment, I don't have quite the negative
visceral reaction.))</i>
I bet people already are thinking the Dead Kennedys'
"Kalifornia /&#220;ber Alles" could be rewritten to be about
Governor Schwartzenegger.
<i>((If no one thought about it, they should.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Steve Langley's film reviews are always fascinating.
I think of myself as someone who likes films, so it's funny
how few films he reviews I've seen.
I haven't seen "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" yet, 
as it hasn't opened here (and well never, it's got incredibly
bad word of mouth).
I do intend to go and see it, as I enjoyed the comic, but one
of my pals saw it and used phrases like "the worst film
ever made" to describe it.
Still, how reliable is he, he liked "A Life Less Ordinary"
(a truly spanky film) and my own tastes in film can be a
bit tendentious (I love the Joel Schumacher "Batman"
films and "The Avengers").
<i>((Yeah, you know I really, really liked "the Avengers".
I thought it was well done and arch, with hints of the old
series just enough to ground you without abnormally raising
comparisons with other actors.
If you missed it, rent it and have an enjoyable evening.))</i>
I bet the film tones down the extent to which the Invisible
Man is a really creepy sociopath.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, as a pedant, I must point out the Fu Manchu 
character's hideout in the comic was in Limehouse, not Soho.
And having Mina Harker in the film as a vampire who can 
walk around in daylight is entirely true to the way vampires
work in "Dracula" the novel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Pirates of the Caribbean" - I've seen this one.
I think it belongs in the world of films that are
quite good rather than ones that are amazingly brilliant.
It does go on a bit and I think it might have been better
with less overt comedy in it (but retaining the campness).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On to 274... Rick Desper boosts "The Pianist", and now
I'm sorry I missed it.
I don't share his hostility towards "Schindler's List".
I found it a genuinely fascinating film and one which didn't seem to 
slip into the same kind of clich&#233;s that Spielberg
usually does.
I'm not really a connoisseur of Holocaust films
so I don't really have much to compare it to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I saw Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" 
recently when it was paying a visit to the local
arthouse cinema.
It's the one in which Chaplin plays both a Jesish
barber and Adolf Hitler.
Chaplin's comedy hasn't really aged well, but
I found the film worked well as a meditation
on intolerance and the nature of Fascism.
I think I must be some kind of overly sentimental
person, because I found Chaplin's "Why can't
we just get along?" speech genuinely affecting.
I think, though, that what makes this film so 
moving is that it was made and set at a time when the full 
awfulness of the Nazis had not become apparent - they
are violent, boorish thugs, but it still seemed
inconceivable that they could unleash something like
the extermination camps.
<i>((When good people put their heads in the sand....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I loved "Memento", but I think it's a real watch-once
kind of film.
There should be a law against watching the scenes in 
the right order.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That whole discussion of twists in films was interesting.
It is true that in most whodunnits the killer is the most
prominent supporting actor.
The twist in "Minority Report" is also amusing for
being the same twist that's in "LA Confidential".
<i>((LA Confidential is another underappreciated film
and it had the twist first....))</i>
In a way, I'd love to go back to being able to just watch
films without analyzing them, so that I would be able to just 
enjoy those "Blimey!  His best friend is the killer!" 
moments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Still, some films have twists that no one could see coming, 
e.g. "From Dusk Till Dawn" (still banned in Ireland, as
far as I know).
<i>((Do you really still have trouble with the Catholic
Church causing certain types of artworks to be banned?
If spam continues much longer, I might become in support
of a worldwide ban on pornography, much as my social
conscience hates the idea.
Then the cyber police could go after all those pornographers
and porn would go back to the old undergrounds it used to
be in before it infiltrated the Internet.....
I'm convinced that there WILL be long term social consequences
from this if it continues.
Really.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've never seen "The Usual Suspects" and don't really know
anything about it apart from who Keyser Soze is.
<i>((It still is very much worth seeing, even if you know,
though it tends to be one of those films that one either adores
or loathes.))</i>
I heard that they did actually film several endings to it.
In fact, I heard a story of a vitriolic Gabriel Byrne
assaulting the director at the first press screening, screaming
"I thought I was Keyser Soze!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A film I really liked recently was "Belleville Rendezvous" 
(or "Les Triplettes De Belleville").
It's a French animated film with almost no dialogue (actually -
no dialogue) so it survives well being shown in the Anglophone world.
It's a great film if you like music, cycling, dogs, or car chases.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's not much talk about The Current International Crisis in your 
szine.
Have you declared it off limits or is everyone bored with it?
<i>((Nothing is off limits, I suppose I am bored with the discussion
of it on some level.
It fascinated me as Bush was putting together the "coalition of reasons
and people" to go in, and eventually choosing the Weapons of Mass
Destruction as the main issue (for good political reasons, but
horrible factual reasons).
And it remains depressing as to how slow they are to understand the
simple (but difficult for us arrogant humans to grasp) idea of context.
I suppose the old Indian sayings about "walking in another person's
moccasins" is the most simple way to say it.
But we all like to think we understand someone else's place.
I suppose if we didn't think that it would inhibit all conversation
and communication, but the bigger the scale the more obtuse the
result when you fail to admit up-front that you haven't walked in
the other guy's moccasins.
I love Dip as a game precisely because it makes you confront this
so often in such a simple game setting.
It also shows you why the "Big Lie" works so much better than the
complex and nuanced truth so much of the time.
In this case, Bush very directly has decided that he does NOT want
to reinforce any constraints on American behavior or policy, so the
best way to do that is essentially to ignore the constraints.
This works fine on one level and not on other levels.
It depends on what level you care about things.
Certainly American hegemony is stronger than ever.
But the basic facts of what is going on in Iraq do tend to bore me,
and it's interesting how suddenly we're all so inured to the one
thing that doesn't bore me - all these good American soldiers
dying on duty.
And that fact alone may kill the volunteer army for the next generation.
The repercussions of this will run deep.
People don't join the National Guard thinking they will spend a year in Iraq,
they think they're joining it so that they can serve their state in times
of natural disaster or crisis.
It's a fundamental change of the contract without discussion.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Music - I've been listening to a lot of Kate Bush lately.
I've been trying to work out whether "The Kick Inside" is her 
only good album.
<i>((Before you raised the issue, that's what I would have said....
but admittedly haven't really thought about it for a long time.))</i>
My current position is that is by far her best, although there are
other good ones.
<i>((Care to send me on a listen with an idea?))</i>
I do love Kate Bush, though, she is a figure of uncompromising 
creativity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Beyond that it's been indie music all the way.
I'm getting more hardlinedly into indie music as I get older.
I hardly listen to any electronic music these days.
Either it's disappeared up its arse or I have.
<i>((I think it's just pretty much gone, I still listen to old
Synergy and Klaus Schultz albums sometimes, just for mood and fun.))</i>
I make exceptions for outfits like Broadcast or the popular Icelandic
band M&#250;m.
I gather, though, that such bands have been snidely dubbed 
"indietronica" by glitchcore purists.
<i>((Yes, that's about right.
Though I was an amazingly intense "Three O'Clock" fan (which some
of this music sounds like), I've been ignoring this trend so far,
though I've heard a song something like "Green Grass of Tunnel",
I think?
That sounded interesting.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I must run now.
I hope you can make sense of my spidery handwriting.
<i>((Interestingly enough, I had a lot of transcription going
this issue for some reason.... though it slowed the issue down,
I love to get real letters!))</i>
Sadly, I've learned from experience that it's handwritten letters or
nothing.
There should be a copy of a recent Frank's APA szine with this, so you can 
read about my trip to Glastonbury.  Or not.

<i>((I loved the excerpt!
You know, I've been listening a great deal to "I Want to See the Bright Lights
Tonight" by Ghod and Linda too for some reason.
I'm not entirely sure why.
I say that having pretty well absorbed the entire Ghod oeuvre into my
subconscious.
It resides down there with "Get Happy!" songs by Elvis Costello.
And you know, Yes was the first band I ever saw live and in person.
You never forget your "first".
The old Yes records are out now on well mastered CD after having been 
tortured for years.
I've been itching to pick up "Close to the Edge" but haven't quite done it yet.
My old vinyl of that is pretty scratchy.
Charlotte does dismiss it Ghod whenever she hears it as too folky (which always is interesting
since she still loves Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan), but it IS always context.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It appears that, when the final chapter is written on the 2003 MLB 
season, the Yankees will have finished first in the AL East, and the Red 
Sox will have finished 2nd.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is how they finished in 2002.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And 2001.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And 2000.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And 1999.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And 1998.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Question:  at what point does this cease to be a coincidence?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To paraphrase someone smarter than I:  the fight doesn't always go to 
the strong, nor the race to the swift, nor the division to the 
well-moneyed.  But that's the way to bet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Winning the division means less when there is a Wild Card and
the Wild Card teams keep winning the World Series.
I don't say I don't care about this, but I don't really care about this.
I know you do.
I like to have Devils in the Playoffs to root against and the Yankees
and Braves are just so consistently there and SO consistently deliver
on losing, especially recently.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In fact, the Yankees have made the playoffs every year since MLB added 
the wild card to the system.  So have the Braves.  Do the division 
standings go strictly by who spends the most money every year?  No.  But 
that's the way to bet, more so every year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Give me the NFL, where of the 32 teams 30 of them have a chance to win 
the Super Bowl every year (the exceptions of course being the management 
inept Arizona Cardinals and Cincinnati Bengals).  Give me NASCAR, where 
nearly 20 drivers have a chance to win any given race, and 15 have a 
chance to win the title every year.  Heck, give me the NHL, where 
everyone makes the playoffs every year anyway.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But don't give me any BS about the WS winner not being up for sale.  Oh, 
they let a couple of poor teams in, but only because they created the 
Central divisions in both leagues.  If they took the top 4 from both 
leagues it would be a different story.  Note that I type this as my Cubs 
are apparently going to pull it out and get to play the Braves in the 
NLDS.  It's still a phyrric victory, as the north siders won't have one 
of the top 4 records in the NL, and 2 of the higher-spending Phillies, 
Marlins and Dodgers will stay home in October, despite having a better 
record.

Jim-Bob,
Let's play Jeopardy:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The answer is:  The President gives a State of the Union address, the 
Yankees make the playoffs, and the Braves make the playoffs.
The question is:  Name 3 things that happen once a year.

The answer is:  The Red Sox win the World Series, the Cubs win the World 
Series, and Jim-Bob solos in a Diplomacy game.
The question is:  Name 3 things that happen once a century.
<i>((I'll have you know that I have soloed more than once AND when the
Red Sox WERE winning the World Series, they were more like the Yankees.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the record, you can have Kurt Busch, even though he's my second 
choice for next year's NASCAR champ (behind Ryan Newman...it's Dodge's 
turn to win).  I've never actually been in a NASCAR fantasy league (or a 
baseball one either), but I believe that the premise of some of them is 
that you get a certain dollar amount, and every team out there is worth 
some money, and you have to buy X number of teams and field something 
less than X for every race (hint:  At Atlanta, play Bobby Labonte).  
There are other ways to play too, I believe.

Wild Card, I don't care if the Yankees and Braves make the playoffs
all the time as long as they don't win the World Series every year.
In my view, which I fully recognize is debatable, the Yankees won
that string of WS because of O'Neill and Brosius and the other 
particular leaders in that Yankee clubhouse.  My evidence is 
simply this: those guys left and they stopped winning WS.
Torre is the same, Clemens is the same, Bernie and Jeter are
the same, but those leaders are gone.
I think the key point is that I LIKE seeing the Yankees and Braves
get in the playoffs and lose.  You hate it.

Jim-Bob,
Picks for MLB:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees over Twins in 4.  Twins rejoice at winning their first game from 
the Yankees in 2 years.
A's over BoSox in 3.  Red Sox don't have the right attitude, and Oakland 
can pitch, Mulder or not.
Braves over Cubs in 5 on a passed ball in the 10th.  Bummer.
Marlins over Giants in 5.  Marlins can also pitch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees over A's in 5.
Braves over Marlins in 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees over Braves in 6.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write it down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2004 prediction:  Yankees win the WS.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2004 prediction:  Ryan Newman wins the NASCAR title.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2004 prediction:  No one will care who wins the Indy 500.  Bummer.

Twins over Yankees in 4;
Red Sox over A's in 3;

Then of course, we have entirely different teams in the CS's.
I've already said Red Sox over Twins and Giants over Cubs.
Then I'm torn.  What I'm saying now is that I'll be wrong in one
of those and whichever one really makes it will win.

<i>((Scorecard afterward: 50-50 each on the Divisional Series,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Tue, 30 Sep 2003 06:50:02 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First, the regular season awards:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL: 
MVP - this one is hard.  Lots of sportswriters, led by Peter Gammons,
think that the MVP MUST come from a winning team.  I think that need
not be the case, if the best player is clearly from a weaker team. 
MVP does not mean best hitter, but most VALUABLE player.  Jayson
Stark says "what part of `value' do you not understand?"  And then
goes on to misdefine "value".  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Baseball is a team sport.  The most valuable player cannot
necessarily make up for a weaker team.
<i>((I think Value is defined very simply, how many games would the
team have won WITHOUT the valuable player.
Texas would have been even worse, far worse down toward Detroit land,
without A-Rod.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Having said all of that, here are the candidates.  I'll only pick one
per team.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Boston - Pedro Martinez.  Should be obvious

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees - this is hard.  No one player stands out.  All of the best
candidates had extended downtime, either because of injury or slumps.
Giambi was a strong candidate until he tanked down the stretch.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Toronto - Delgado had a great year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Minnesota - nobody (please! don't bring up Shannon Stewart!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Chicago - Thomas or Ordonez.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
KC - nobody

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oakland - Mulder would have been a good candidate before his injury.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Seattle - All of their best candidates had poor Septembers

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've gotta vote for Pedro.  His presence on the mound changes the
game more than the presence of any other player in the AL.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cy Young:  I've got to go for Halladay over Pedro based on wins and
innings pitched, even though I would take Pedro on the mound over
Halladay any day.  But 14 wins is not enough for the Cy Young.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rookie:  I'll go with Baldelli over Matsui.  Matsui's only really
impressive stat is RBI, which is largely a result of playing for the
Yankees.  Baldelli is a more exciting player in my mind.
<i>((And more of a true rookie, and from Rhode Island to boot.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Manager: I'll go with Tony Pena, even though the Royals faded down the
stretch.
<i>((I agree with that entirely.
Pena is going to be the next great manager.
Wonder if Boston will trade for him after they dump Grady?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL:
MVP:  this was a two-horse race between Bonds and Pujols.  Bonds
missed a lot of time at the end of the season.  Pujols stands out in
more categories.  I'll pick Pujols by a nose, but Bonds is also a
good choice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cy Young:  if Greg Gagne doesn't win it will be a scandal.  What more
can a reliever do?  Arguably the best season by a reliever ever.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rookie: Brandon Webb over Dontrelle Willis

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Manager: I'll go with Dusty Baker here.  Jack McKeon is also a good
choice.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, to the playoffs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Boston over A's in 5.  Pedro wins game 1, A's win game 2, Lowe wins
at Fenway in game 3, so Grady decides not to start Pedro in game 4,
which Hudson wins.  Pedro beats Zito in game 5.  
<i>((You are a near mind-reader, even though you didn't quite get
the order of the wins right.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yankees over Twins in 5.  Santana steals game 1, but Yankees beat up
on Radke in game 2.  They go to Minnesota and Clemens pitches a gem
to win game 3.  Santana comes back to win game 4, but Yankees clinch
at home.
The Yankees really need to be careful here.  Keep in mind that the
Twins were the best team in the Majors since the All-Star break.
<i>((You called this one pretty well too!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL:
Braves over Cubs in 5.  The Cubs' lineup is just a little too thin.
<i>((You missed JUST this one!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Marlins over Giants in 4.  Upset special.  I really like the Marlins
a lot.  Young pitching, lots of speed, clutch hitting and veteran
leadership in Pudge.  
<i>((Nailed that one!!!
Damn.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Red Sox over Yankees in 6
The Red Sox have the patient hitting that can beat the Yankees. 
Pedro will turn it up a notch to win this series.  Might go 7.
<i>((Oh well, indeed....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Braves over Marlins in 7
Ugh, I don't like picking the Braves.  
<i>((Then why did you????  You should have known their pitching would
fail them in the playoffs.... but who am I to complain??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series:  Sox over Braves in 4.
OK, 4 is a bit unrealistic.  Let's make it 5.  They steal one in
Atlanta and sweep at home.
:)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I really want to pick a Sox-Cubs world series, but I cannot escape
the feeling that the Cubs really are the weakest of all the playoff
teams.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A brief glimpse of life in the path of the storm -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The sun rose unseen over Virginia Beach a few minutes ago.  It's there, of
course, but no one here will see it today.  I'll be content to see it
tomorrow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm surprised it's so calm at this point.  Now, "calm" is a relative term;
there is a stiff breeze running through the trees every now and then,
interrupted by moments of ACTUAL calm.  But the Weather Channel video of the
Virginia Beach oceanfront showed a different picture - steady 30 knot winds
and gusts they estimated at about 45 knots.  I live only about six or seven
miles from where that shot was being filmed, live, less than thirty minutes
ago.  The difference, I suppose, is the screen of mature trees that occupy
most of the peninsula on which we live.  Later today, though, that won't be
of much help.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I may have mentioned to you that yesterday, in contrast, began as a
mockingly beautiful morning, a cloudless sky futilely beckoning me to get
out the sticks and go play eighteen.  The first rain bands hit at about 4:20
yesterday afternoon, but didn't last long.  We had periodic stretches of
rain and wind last night, but nothing all that disturbing or unusual for a
summer storm.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The surprising thing is the tide.  Our house backs up to a finger of Dix
Creek, which extends from the Lynnhaven River and thence on into the
Chesapeake Bay.  I was just outside a few minutes ago, and saw what I
generally would regard as a higher-than-normal high tide.  The only problem
is, we're less than two hours away from LOW tide right now; the high tide
that will occur at 3:00 pm today will probably cover about half of my back
yard.  I have heard estimates of expected storm surges of four to eight feet
above normal for the height of the storm here, which should be (gulp!) right
around the time of this afternoon's high tide.  Still, that much flooding
won't reach the foundations of our home, which is about eighteen or nineteen
feet above the water level.  Some of my neighbors are not so advantageously
situated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still have power, obviously, but have been cautioned to expect to lose it
later today when the storm creeps inland and the wind picks up to eighty
knots or so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For now, we are safe, dry, and comfortable.  Callie and The Boss are still
horizontal; I've got a couple cups of coffee in my belly, and have a
positive outlook about how we'll endure what is to come today.  I am
sincerely grateful to those of you who have written to express concern and
good wishes; one does not easily forget expressions of friendship such as
these.  I will write later if we have the juice, but in any event will
contact somebody once the storm passes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best wishes to each of you.

<br /><br /><b>Steve Emmert (Sun, 21 Sep 2003 14:07:58 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm back, and meaner than ever!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, then; where to begin . . .?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As Randy and Mike were kind enough to pass along for me, my family and 
I are all safe and healthy.  Our home sustained no damage from the storm; 
I didn't lose any trees (I do have a lifetime supply of kindling from all 
the branches that fell).  We still have city water and sewer, we have 
gas for the stove, and for some inexplicable reason, we still have phone service.  
I have a small generator to run the refrigerator and a couple of small appliances.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But . . .
No juice, and no internet (I'm now at a cybercafe).  A large tulip poplar fell across the 
mouth of our cul-de-sac, taking with it a utility pole (including transformer), 
and both are still lying across our street.  Today is the first day I have been 
able to take my car out of my street since Wednesday.  My best estimate for a return to 
the Twentieth Century (electricity) is another 3 to 7 days.  Moving up to the 
Twenty-First (internet connection) might take a few more days beyond that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For those of you in my Worldmasters game, I can stop in here from time to time to chat, 
but I'm not sure I'll be able to devote enough time here to conduct normal negotiations.  
I propose to give this a try during my lunch hour during the coming week, 
to see if it gives me enough time to negotiate with some semblance of normalcy.  
If that doesn't work, I invite you to let Randy know whether you want to wait for 
me to get back up and running at home, or whether you would prefer that one of my 
teammates takes over the position for a game year or so.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For what it's worth, I invite everyone to count your blessings.  I already have; seeing the 
pictures of the North Carolina Outer Banks, and of places here in Virginia Beach, 
where the damage was much worse than what I got, convinces me of how incredibly lucky I am.  
Yesterday I borrowed a car to drive over to my father's house to check on him 
(I had no idea whether he was okay or not for three days), and while I was 
happy to find him healthy (albeit eager for a return of power and phone service), 
I was horrified at the damage to the neighborhood in which I grew up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll compose more later, but wanted to let everyone know how very much 
I appreciate your notes of concern and encouragement.  I'm fine, and look forward 
eagerly to get back to schemin'.  I will have some pretty cool pictures to bring to 
Tempest next month.

I'm glad you are well, and YES, I'm really glad I didn't fly down to
DC into the outskirts of this in the middle of the storm (if I could
even have done it - I was scheduled to have a meeting in Washington the
day of the storm, instead we had an EIGHT hour conference call, pure
torture, but at least it was safe).  We worry for you, while thanking the lucky 
stars that it didn't hit us.
Be well, my friend!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim, as long as you're interested in running some of my storm commentary, I
thought I'd forward this to you.  I composed it the day before the hurricane
hit, and sent it to the GM and the other players in my WM02 game.  I'll send
you more later; the current situation is that I still don't have electricity
at home, although I do here at work.  I expect to be without power for
another three to seven days, perhaps more.  The novelty has worn off.  Best
wishes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br />Your friendly R212 weather report

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gentlemen -
I am writing to you from my office, whence I do not usually conduct
diplomacy, just to let you know how things stand here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The gods are mocking us here in southeastern Virginia; this morning dawned
gorgeous, a brilliant sun slowly climbing a cloudless sky.  Meanwhile, the
aformentioned gods are probably snickering among themselves at what they
have in store for us.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
According to the latest information I have, we are supposed to get
tropical storm force winds sometime late today, and hurricane force winds
by tomorrow.  This is apparently a very large storm, with a swath of
hurricane force winds roughly 300 miles wide.  So unless the storm turns
left at Albuquerque, it now appears very likely that my city will take a
big hit, even if the eye is miles away.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My family is staying put, as is virtually everyone else on my street.  I
live in a brick ranch house, built 34 years ago; I am convinced that the
Big Bad Wolf won't blow it down.  The most likely consequence for us,
though, will be a loss of electricity, since this is an older neighborhood
with lots of mature trees and above-ground power lines.  My next-door
neighbor, who has lived on this street for about 20 years, told me
yesterday that he was absolutely certain we would lose power (he said he'd
bet his house on it); the only question was, for how long.  The last time
we had a significant storm, he said it was out for three days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is already a very expensive storm for me, even before the first
raindrop falls.  We spent $200 on Sunday stocking up on nonperishable food
and drinking water, and I plopped down $450 on Monday for a small portable
generator.  It's big enough to run my refrigerator and a few small
appliances, but I do not plan to hook my computer up to it.  I plan to
survive this storm with my family and my house intact.  I'll write to you
as soon as I can afterward to confirm how we're doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Years ago, when I was young and stupid, I actually looked forward to the
experience of a hurricane.  It was a thrilling prospect, not to mention a
break from the heat of the late summer, and I actually hoped one would
come ashore where I lived.  Then, one year very recently, we got grazed by
one - Floyd, I think, in 1999.  It was awful, lying in bed, listening to
the wind howl and the rain beat fiercely on your windows, and hoping a
tree doesn't fall on your house.  I am long since cured of any desire to
see a hurricane, but am now resigned to living through another one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So here I am, and here it comes.  I won't ask anyone to pray for me; there
are many other people far more in need of that than I am.  I am writing,
however, to thank you for the very kind expressions of concern and of your
well-wishing; that really means a great deal to me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for the game, to coin a phrase, I'll Be Back.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY-BOARD): Can't we all just get along?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IRON DUCK to GM): As you know so well from our relationship over the last two
decades, every once in a while, I shake off my lethargy and write a couple of
lines of great press.
Alas, this is not going to be one of those times....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to IRON DUCK): Let me be the judge of that, I'd give you at least a 
seven iron.... though you are inching toward a challenge of the house rule
that no handwriting in orders and press be messier than mine.
If I misread anything, it's surely still my fault, but it's getting closer....
danger, Will Robinson!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to EUROPE): We regret the recent presence of a fourth German unit
in this game.
No, really.
We have endeavored in this game, since about 1904, to create no panic
regarding the peace-loving German peoples, especially given our lamentable
tendency to conquer and subjugate our neighbors.
Either at your throat or at your feet, that's us.
The offending unit will be dispatched east at the earliest opportunity.
You <b>know</b> how much German soldiers like fighting Eastern campaigns.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GERMANY): Lucky for you, Stalingrad is a war in the future....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to PARIS): SOmeone recently asked us why all the highways leading to
Paris were tree-lined.
We guessed it was so we could march in the shade.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to LONDON): I hope the recent loss of Denmark to German exchange students
will not cause undue hostility between us.
We, of course, do not know where said students came into ownership of small
arms, artillery, and martial tactics, and would be happy to join you
in a special commission to investigate same.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB RETAINS A UNIQUE VIEW OF TIME): On coming up to the twentieth anniversary
of the "Invasion of Grenada and the Liberation of the Medical Students", what
could be more ironic?  Reminds you that W wasn't the first president to 
invade a country on a pretext to distract the American people from another 
foreign policy issue (in that case, of course, it was the debacle in Lebanon).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to ITALY): You promised me that you would not remain a lapdog
to the Ottoman.
Can I get my money back on the flowers I sent?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DUCKETH ONE): Can I get my money back on the second bet I made
on how Fassio would fare at North American DipCon?
I aced the first bet perfectly (betting that Fassio would take full and
complete credit for my absence - it really was all YOUR fault).
But I was SURE Flash would beat Shark Chum, Judas, and of course you.
Boy, was I wrong. 
You had a GREAT tournament from all reports.
Now, how can you run me out of the hobby after saying that....
this is called taking the editorial liberty and running away with it!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SAUGUS to PROVIDENCE): Just so you know, I am intending to have you run out
of the Hobby post-haste, if not sooner, on the grounds that you are 
total boobish nincompoop and a danger to yourself and others, especially me.
On what planet is calling Brad Wilson as a standby a good idea???
Even allowing Brad into a game as a starter is against the law in
31 states (and the District of Columbia), but to call him in as a 
standby?
And let's not forget the fact that Brad has NMRed out of more games
than anybody.... with the probable exception of me.
Shame on you, James Burgess, shame....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PROVIDENCE, THE BEST LITTLE CITY IN THE LAND to SAUGUS, A CALIFORNIA
PLANNED COMMUNITY AND GREASESPOT ON THE DESERT HIGHLANDS): I claim
a tortured, but clean logic.
Who better than Brad could act like Flap Jack?
And Brad DID tell me he was on the standby list.
And he IS playing and getting orders in for the only game I see him
in these days in another famous szine that will remain nameless.
But in the end, when you're in times of trouble, let Brad be and
name the absolutely reliable Paul Rauterberg.
He's probably not speaking to me these days, but I really do appreciate
him, really I do....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IRON DUCK to SWEET CHARLOTTE): Hello, darling!
Are you tired of you-know-who yet?
Are you ready for a west coast liaison yet?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CHARLOTTE SAYS): I'm ready to turn from men entirely, except that
I don't like women either!
<i>((I only paraphrased a little....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to BURGESS): I mean that in a purely asexual, non-spouse-threatening
sort of way.
Really.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DOON): No problem, I knew she'd say something like the above.
you haven't a chance even if you DID mean it in a threatening way.
You wouldn't live to tell the tale.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to EDINBURGH): Good morning, indeed!
I appreciate the new-found trust we have somehow dug out of the debris of
six years of war.
Let's keep our steel pointed in the right direction-east!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILLIAMS to TRETICK, SUNDSTROM): It occurs to me, gentlemen, that the time is 
now right and proper for us to completely and totally set aside our 
differences and fight for the right to party.... hmmm, I think I
may have just been channeling the Beastie Boys.
Sigh... you have a mere dalliance with controlled substances
for 20 years or so, and <b>this</b> is what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But, as I was saying, we three represent the best and brightest in
this game and we should therefore win.
Failing agreement on that statement (given its 100% bilge quotient),
we should at least be allowed to win solely on the fact that we
three are the only original players left in the game.
The rest of these Johnny-Come-Latelys are mere pretenders and ought
to be boxed up and sent away like the importuning imposters they are.
Time for us to get our metal (and mettle) together lads!
Into the breach?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARNO to GM): 1976 rule X, "Cutting Support":  
"If a unit ordered to support in a 
given space is attacked from a space <b>different</b> from the one into which 
it is giving support," ... its support is cut.  Bulgaria is different 
from Greece, into which A Gre is giving support, so the support is cut 
and A Bul with A Ser's support is strength 2 against A Gre supported by 
F Alb.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to GM): I disagree with your interpretation of a rule. My
1976 Diplomacy rulebook says that, "If a unit ordered to support
in a given space is attacked from a space different from the one
into which it is giving support, or is dislodged by an attack
from any space, including the one into which it is giving
support, then its support is cut." It says nothing about
nationality.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thus, Turkey's order of A Bul-Ser last turn should have cut
the support from its A Ser S GERMAN A Gre-Bul, and Germany's
unsupported move of F Gre-Bul should have failed (which you did
adjudicate), in addition to the Turkish move of F Alb-Gre.
However, you are correct that self-dislodgement is prohibited,
so even if Turkey had ordered A Bul H, the Turkish support of
Germany's attack was invalid.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GM): Pay attention to these guys and stop making mistakes!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): Bruce, either you're very inept or very
sneaky. (I have my opinion which one it is.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let's take a step back and analyze this game. You have failed
to get me, France or the new England to turn on each other.
Instead, FER has created a stalemate line that allows you to own
at most 16 centers. There is no good reason, then, why any of
the three of us wouldn't vote for the five-way draw. (In my
book, a draw is a draw, regardless of how many players are part
of it - as long as I'm one of them!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This means that either you or Germany is vetoing the five-way
draw. We have a simple way to find out who it is: Eliminate
Germany. If you do and vote for an FRET draw, then the game is
over. If you eliminate Germany and don't vote for a four-way
draw, or if you don't eliminate Germany, then it's your fault
why this game isn't ending.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you want this game to end, then eliminate Germany by
ordering A Ser S F Alb-Gre, F Alb-Gre and A Bul H in Spring
1915, and ordering F Gre H in Fall 1915. Then, we can
unanimously approve an FRET draw.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you fail to do this, then I have to conclude, as I have
entertained for some time, that you want to win this game by any
means possible, including hoping that England, France or I will
NMR, allowing you to break our line. This is really a despicable
way to notch a win, and I think someone like you who has been in
this hobby long enough would be above such desperate measures. I
feared such a thing when Jim Sayers dropped out, but it didn't
happen. At least our GM accepts standing orders (which I have
been using for the past several turns, by the way). But at some
point of stagnation, I think the GM should step in and call this
game a DIAS - unless the literal death of any of the
counteralliance players, given the possible extended longevity
of this game, won't jeopardize the stalemate line.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Do the honorable thing, Bruce, and eliminate Germany. (There
is honor among Diplomacy players, just like there is among
thieves, you know.)

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
But you never know, given how extreme the yuppiedom part of the game
has gone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PAUL to ALL): Remember, I don't like people who nuke home dots.  They 
upset me.  They make me, almost, vengeful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to THE WORLD): At this point clueless, and too lazy.  I simply play
nuke the leader.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm keeping only one list for the new game now up above.
This is scary, the game has gone on for six years now, hasn't it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "Looking out from here, at half past France;
Things are much different here than Norway, not so cold."
from 	"Half Past France" by Sally Timms of the Mekons from her
solo record, <i>To the Land of Milk and Honey</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to WORLD): To be fair, I should note that the following press
is very old and may or may not reflect the current positions of the
authors.
Who's to say, certainly not me!
But for fairness, I thought that caveat was needed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-WORLD): ... the way that Germany is laying down to Ukraine,
I've decided to rename his country. 
From this point forward we are now going to call Germany; (France).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to SPAIN):  You gotta think before you do, boy.  Y'see, afterward 
don't do you a lick of good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN KIRK to THE UNIVERSE): Attack the Romulans or learn how to
speak Romulan!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UKRAINE - EGYPT): Certainly, the alliance offer is still open.  Did you prefer
to retire in the Sinai or in Jordan?
