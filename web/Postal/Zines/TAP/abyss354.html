<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> at least for awhile longer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Let's get the new Diplomacy game going.
Since Doug is winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.
I do have that option on the table in relation to the next announcement 
about the big MOVE of the Pouch site to Chris Babcock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, the big announcement is that the Diplom.org site is physically moving again 
(it actually pretty much is moved).  Millis Miller has done a great job with the
sysadmin job behind the scenes for many years on this, but he asked us all recently
if we could move the site.
Chris Babcock has stepped forward, where he may be able to do some content refreshment
in addition to basic hosting.
There are many things to be worked out, including updates on the tap mailing list,
we'll announce those in the next "Christmas" issue.
For today, let's thank Millis Miller for his hard work all these years and REALLY
thank Chris Babcock for helping to make the transition so smooth. 
It really has gone well, and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.

Shame, shame, shame... with the move of the diplom.org site, I hope this will be

let's move on to that.

Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is nice to be able to move on to basketball season given SU's disappointing football
season.  For my first time I went in on football season tickets with a buddy and SU had 
their worst home record since the Dome opened.  Their only home win was vs. 
'Nova - which they only won because Nova missed a chip shot field goal at the 
end of regulation.  The number of injuries was ridiculous this season.  
Hard to win with a third string QB playing behind your second string offensive line! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think this will be a fun basketball season.  We will lose some games for sure.  
There is a lot of talent on the team but it is young and unproven.  
The freshmen look good.  We need someone, anyone, who can hit a jump shot, 
though.  Maybe Patterson will be the answer.

<i>((Yes, too bad that Providence College and Syracuse are in different leagues now.
I always followed Syracuse basketball for that reason, but my attention span may
languish a bit now.
We'll see.
The storyline of the season so far is what Calipari has done in Kentucky,
and how they can get in their own way.
PC is playing them soon to get destroyed, though PC's young team has been coming
together pretty well, and just sneaked into the top 25.
Kris Dunn was a 2012 McDonald's All American and then has been injured (labrum), but
is coming back in fits and starts toward potential real stardom.
Continuing the injury problem, though, he just sprained an ankle and will miss
the Kentucky game.  
PC probably will lose by 30.))</i>

I had planned to write more on Richard Thompson, but I'm running way behind.
Let's see where we are on the last page.  Richard Thompson's son Teddy also
has what seems like a fascinating new album, which I've heard some of but don't
own yet, entitled <i>Family</i> that I will have to comment
on more at some point.
Teddy manages to engage the different members of his family, including the
parents who left an indelible memory in my mind in their 
last concert tour here in Providence
where Linda hauled off and kicked Richard in the shin in the 
middle of the concert.
So this could be an all-Ghod section for awhile.))</i>

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year, the finals are starting now.
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals 
are now starting, everyone has been queried.
But you also still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!
Word is we may cancel them, I think the finals should reignite interest.
We also are picking up some discussion for a successor Diplomacy World Cup.
I think we all realize that this interesting experiment has not been completely
successful.
I recently was elected to the Council for DWC IV, so if anyone has any 
ideas about where this idea should go to reinvigorate it, please let me know!

1) I have lots of Fall orders, but well short of everyone's, so we just have the press

(ST. GALL, SWITZERLAND): A monk in a black habit walks into the library. 
The doorkeeper meets him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Gruss Gott! How may I assist your research?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"My abbot has instructed me to obtain a copy of Ordo Romanus 45."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"This will take some time. The ordo is only in a manuscript which is quite delicate. 
I shall have to have a couple of assistants prepare a copy. 
It will take a few days, unless your abbot needs it on vellum. 
It will require several weeks longer to obtain the materials in that case."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"No, ordinary paper will suffice. My abbot needs the content, 
not the quality of the original."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Indeed. May I ask what your abbot needs it for?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I was not told. I presume he wants to add it to the library. 
I believe he has ambitions to set up the monastery as a center for 
liturgical research along the lines of Louvain, Maria Laach, or Klosterneuburg. 
But I am a relatively new monk, and not one of the abbot's confidants. 
I merely obey, as holy St. Benedict instructed."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I see. Although we are no longer a Benedictine monastery here, 
we have a few rooms for visiting scholars. 
You may make arrangements with the diocesan chancery."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So I was instructed."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"And in the meantime, you will have access to the library."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Thank you very much. May God bless your work."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"And yours."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MUNICH): The new, as yet uncrowned Kaiser and his escort have arrived at the 
Bavarian capital after a long journey.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Rest up, your highness; we meet with Luitpold tomorrow."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"But not with King Otto?" replied the Kaiser.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"No, young sire. It is widely known among noble circles, 
but not so much in those you have come from. 
King Otto is quite mad and has been since before his coronation. 
His uncle, Luitpold, is the regent, as he was for the King's 
predecessor and brother before him."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"His brother was king during unification, no?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"He was. That was before Leopold II was declared mentally ill. 
Otto first showed signs of his illness around that time, however."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So Luitpold is the real ruler of Bavaria?" asked Wilhelm III

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Under yourself, of course."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Of course. I am still getting used to this."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Prussia, and indeed the whole empire, will be getting used to the house of Fedewa."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So we are meeting with the regent. Do you have any notes for me?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Indeed, and we will go over them in the morning. 
But the gist of them is this. Regent Luitpold is the real ruler of Bavaria, 
and Bavaria is the most powerful of the German states after Prussia. 
So the regent is the most powerful of your subjects."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Do you think there will be trouble?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"No," replied the senior advisor. "He, and all of Bavaria, 
is loyal to the empire, as long as the empire continues to exist. 
But in the wake of recent events, the regent will surely want 
some reassurance that the empire, and Prussia's leadership of it, will continue. 
Remember, Luitpold's duty is to look after Bavaria. 
If he believes that the German Reich will descend into chaos, 
why should he not make a deal with the other south German states? 
Or with Austria or France? If he believes that Prussia is prostrate, 
it would only be sensible for him to look to make other arrangements."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"We will have to show him that Prussia isn't dead yet."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Indeed, sire. But to bed. It is already 9:57 PM."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ST. GALL, SWITZERLAND four days later): "Brother Matthias?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yes?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Your manuscript is ready."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Thank you."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Thank my assistants, Don and Wilhelm."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What is this iconography on this capital?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It is a duck, Brother Matthias."

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) A little better on replenishment as a pack starts to form.  
Racing Froggy has no points, but is
getting farther ahead in total replenishment, will he break out soon?

<br /><i>Press (I solicited some comments this time...):</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DOUG KENT): I hate your clues.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RICK DESPER): Apparently he referred to Gordon Brown as a one-eyed Scottish idiot. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE RUTTINGER): Well, unless I've missed something (and I have pretty much all game), 
this comes down to either Iquique or Cuya, Chile. If it's the former, 
it's a little ironic that it's a city I have nearly guessed at least 2-3 
times before talking myself out of each time. 
I'm kind of curious how Jim-Bob picks these, too. 
Iquique is a pretty fun name to say, so I'll go with that approach 
(though if we were going on the fun-to-say factor, 
Lake Titicaca would have won every time).
As for the "who" factor, I've been pretty clueless throughout. 
Thanks to someone for doing their homework far better than I did, 
such that I could just google the names with "idiot" to try to find the right 
guess. Before that, my best guess that I never made was probably 
Meghan McCain, who is both the wrong gender and the wrong nationality. 
So yeah, if I somehow win (or tie for a win, since I suspect several 
people will get the right answer), it just proves that it's better to 
be lucky than good. Thanks, Jim-Bob, for a fun diversion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB): So, as I was choosing, I was watching a brilliant Top Gear episode
on their Bolivia to Chile trek that ended up just south of Iquique.
They actually reached the Pacific at Caleta Los Verdes, about 20k south of 
Iquique, but as Mike said "Iquique" was cooler to say.
Top Gear is one of our favorite shows and despite the fact that Doug
hated my clues, Jeremy gave me what ***I*** thought was the opportunity
for fun clues.
Additional commentary welcome for next time.
As to why I chose Jeremy Clarkson over James May or Richard Hammond, well
Jeremy's Range Rover was declared the winner of the event, despite the
fact that Jeremy kept disparaging it.
And his only political involvement I could find, as Rick noted, was
a disparaging comment about Gordon Brown, you guys went WAY off
on the wrong track for a while.
For more...

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
In the sequence of Richard Thompson thoughts, this issue I'm going to talk about four 
of the songs on <i>Acoustic Classics</i> from the Richard and Linda Thompson 
years, which of course
pretty much were sung by Linda in their originals, and Richard with unaccompanied 
acoustic guitar here.  Three of them are the first three songs on the CD that set
the tone, the title track from <i>I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight</i> and
"Walking on a Wire" and "Wall of Death" from <i>Shoot Out the Lights</i> (the title
track of that one is later on the CD).
So, as I've discussed before, Richard has taken voice lessons and sharpened up his 
voice over the last couple of decades, so he sings better here than he did over
the Richard/Linda 1974-1982 period.
Still, Linda had an incredible voice, before her more recent bouts of voice problems
that leave her unable to sing live on tour at all, so she is missed on these songs.
I particularly found "Wall of Death" to be a great 
acoustic arrangement, but lacking in 
some of the soaring vocal bite that it had with a full band and different singing.
Richard's TWO solos on "Shoot Out the Lights" are particularly noteworthy 
for the completely gripping acoustic guitar work.
"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight" and "Walking on a Wire" in places
where he was simultaneously playing on the high and low guitar strings I could have
sworn he must have been doing it with a third hand - though seeing it live verified
that he somehow was doing it with only two.
All this just makes me want to listen to all the different versions and appreciate
each of them for what they are.
"Walking on a Wire" has a particularly effective urgent ending.
For people who live and breathe Ghod's music, this has been great for getting me
grabbing all the different versions and replaying them, but <i>Acoustic Classics</i>
really is a great album in its own right as well.
More on other songs and parts of it in future issues.</b>
