<p><br><p><br><b>THE ARSENIC AND OLD FARTS FINAL STATEMENT IS AT THE END OF THE SZINE - CHECK IT OUT!</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The szine is slightly late, but we should be alright.
If anyone has a serious problem, we can delay games on specific request.
I wanted to take the beginning of the szine for a George W. Bush editorial
from a perspective I haven't seen yet in the increasingly homogenous US
national media.
You know what ONE single event of the Bush presidency indicates to me
the mistaken initial direction of this administration more than any other?
I'll bet you'll be surprised and may even have forgotten entirely about
this issue yourselves.
OK, raise your hands, how many of you remember that there was an earthquake
in India - centered in Gujarat - a little over two months ago??
Brits don't count, since you have heard a lot about this, but this has
gotten NO coverage in the US.

<p>
How serious is this?  On the BBC World Service a week ago or so, 
one of their correspondents visited a city in Gujarat that he
previously had visited right after the earthquake. 
Two months later, NO cleanup had begun, and NO buildings in the city
were habitable.
The mayor and his granddaughter were living in the mayor's car (which
was surrounded by debris and couldn't move) and most of the rest of 
the town was living in tents or in the open.
Apparently there is both a lack of equipment and a lack of money.
The Brits are somewhat organized in trying to do something about this.

<p>
On the BBC's web site, you can see evidence of concern from the
British Indian community with music fundraisers:

<p>
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/asiannetwork/appeals.shtml

<p>
and for more general news and a comprehensive list of websites
collecting British funds see:

<p>
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/asianlife/news/appeal1.shtml

<p>
OK, so you ask, what does all this have to do with Mr. Bush??
The US also has a significant Indian community and there have been
isolated campus protests about the US turning a blind eye to this
situation, but it gets NO coverage.
Going back to the turn of the last century, is George W. Bush is
no Teddy Roosevelt.
Where is the bully pulpit??
I'm not even asking for direct US funds or commitments, just a statement
of awareness - that would be all that is needed to help the situation.
Compassionate conservatism, my foot.... and my foot is booting our
dear President in the butt!
Where is the so-called greatest nation in the world and just a tiny bit of
help from the President on the awareness issue?
I have no problem with many other elements of the conservative
Republican message, but this is the one that just burns my butt.
Sorry, but I'm really pissed at this one.
Many of his other deficiencies have gotten at least some airing, but
this one I see as the greatest harbinger of bad feeling against 
America around the world - and that we shall come to regret and 
pay for dearly.
Rant ended......

<p><br><p><br><b>THE DUE DATE FOR ALL TINAMOU GAMES IS APRIL 16TH, 2001</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are ``taking over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
We have Michael Lowrey's <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a 
Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here 
as <i>Deny Everything</i>'s next issue appears below too. 

<p>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:
/

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
/Postal/

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.meurglys.com

<p>
The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (in a MUCH, MUCH improved way!)
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.

<p>
2) For the most recent issue of Pete Sullivan's subszine 
check out (this address will be changing shortly):

<p>
 http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.
I'm not sure what Pete is up to at the moment, but we'll hear soon.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARK BERCH</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>A number of people have tried to contact Mark, but none have hit paydirt
yet.  
See Mark Larzelere's note below.
I hope this one will be solved soon, just one more issue to go!!

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mark Larzelere (Fri, 16 Mar 2001 20:29:52 EST)</b>

<p>
Anyone ``found" Berch yet?  Someone once joked that you could just write ``The 
Dipi Master" on an envelope and drop it in the mail, and it would get to him. 
I bumped into Mark and Joshua at a chess tournament in Maryland five years 
ago.  Joshua is now one of the stronger high school age chessplayers in 
Maryland (no, I haven't played him).

There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

ROBERT SACKS WINS BPA SPORTSMAN OF THE YEAR: In the wake of Hollywood's 
Oscars, the Boardgame Player's Association announces New York's Robert 
Sacks as the recipient of its most prestigious award. One of fifty 
individuals nominated by WBC GMs for their display of sportsmanship, 
Robert won the voting which was thrown open to the membership as a whole 
for the first time this year by narrowly defeating Jim Pyle of Colonial 
Heights, VA. In all, 37 of the 50 nominees received votes. Robert's cause 
was probably aided by those who viewed it as a sort of lifetime 
acknowledgement for his constant willingness to volunteer his time at 
WBC. Sadly, the award must be posthumous since Robert passed away two 
weeks after WBC 2000. More details are posted on our website.

``The Tailor of Panama" ... a movie

<p>
Forty years ago Alec Guiness made `Our Man in Havana' which was about a 
salesman who fouind himself in debt.  He fell into the path of a spy 
apparatus which mistook him for a super spy.  His money problems were solved 
so long as he could keep spinning convincing and intrigueing lies.  
Ultimately it all came undone, but it was funny, and nobody got hurt.

<p>
John LeCarre took the idea and developed it with a darker theme. 

<p>
Picture James Bond gone over to the dark side.  Pierce Brosnin plays Andy 
Osnard, a British Spy who is sent off to Panama because his womanizing caused 
him to blow his cover in Madrid.  He needs a big break to get back into the 
good graces of the powers that be.  Geoffrey Rush plays Harry Pendel, who is 
exactly what he pretends to be, but isn't at all what he says he is.  Harry 
is a tailor.  He's every bit as good as he claims to be.  He has the talent, 
and the people skills to tailor to the rich and powerful.  Andy sees Harry as 
his conduit to the inside.  Andy knows Harry's secret, that he learned the 
tailor craft in prison, not in Saville Row.  Andy threatens to break Harry's 
secret to Jamie Lee Curtis who plays Louisa, Harry's wife.  Harry can't bear 
the thought of losing his wife and family but he doesn't know any secrets, so 
he starts spinning tales for Andy.

<p>
The more Harry tells him, the more power Andy develops in his own political 
infight.  The more power Andy gains, the more pressure he puts on Harry.  
Things get out of control.  Real events start reacting to the imaginary.

<p>
Unlike `Our Man in Havana' when it all comes undone, it isn't very funny and 
people do get hurt.  This is a serious thriller with an unlikely hero, and a 
villain who would have been the good guy in any other story.

<p>
The movie was shot in Panama, which gives it extra points for exotic.

``O Brother Where Art Thou? ... a movie

<p>
I was reluctant to go see this.  George Clooney had never really delivered 
for me.  He seemed to be one of those actors who always just plays himself.  
For some that works.  Then I was told that it was a very good movie by 
someone who has never given me a bad tip.  So, when the movie I chose to see 
this weekend turned out to be a disappointment I decided to search out `O 
Brother'.  It was more than worth the effort.

<p>
Between some really wonderful cinematography and a whole movie full of 
strange and wonderful characters the Coen's have once again given a whole new 
cut at the meaning of weird.

<p>
Clooney was not playing himself for a change.  He was playing the role of 
Ulysses, a fast talking if not too bright con in a long trek home, based 
loosely on Homer's epic.  Turns out the man has a lot more talent that I was 
giving him credit.  For that matter John Turturro showed a lot of different 
sides to himself as Pete, Ulysses not too bright friend.  Tim Blake Nelson 
plays Delmar, the dimmest of the three.  The three of them are escaped chain 
gang fugitives chasing after a fortune that is about to be flooded by the 
TVA.  This makes it circa 1930s.  The flavor of the time comes through via an 
extraordinary sound track of songs sung by members of the cast.

<p>
The three meet a blind poet who foretells that they will find their fortune, 
just not the one they seek.  

<p>
Special note has to be given to John Goodman who plays the Cyclops who 
outwits Ulysses (I said based loosely).

<p>
Funny, touching, nice, delightful movie.

``Heart Breakers" ... a movie

<p>
Not a great story.  Not very likable characters.  If it were not for Gene 
Hackman's wonderful interpretation of a chain smoking tobacco executive the 
alligator eating the duck would have been the high point of the movie.

<p>
Jennifer Love Hewitt got to dress to show off her talents.

<p>
Sigourney Weaver will probably try to forget that she made this one.

The audience was somewhat vocal, and much of what they had to say was funnier

``Exit Wounds" ... a movie

I'm starting to fall a bit behind.

First impressions.  Steven Seagal might think about `Weight Watchers".  DMX

No surprises in the story line.  The trailers pretty much gave the plot away. 
As always with Steven Seagal there is some great choreography in the fight 
sequences.  I don't know if he does it himself or if he hires it out, but 
someone there is a genius.

<p>
Lots of car chases and explosions.  Action movie stunt coordinaters have yet 
to figure out that today's cars come with airbags.  I was noticing one of my 
pet gripes about car stunts, which is, the car does something impossible 
ending in a crash, the the driver crawls out and walks away.  I consider this 
sort of thing bad training for young drivers.  

<p>
But there was a face plant angainst a windshield ending up with a dead driver 
that took the wind out of those sails.  Too bad she didn't have an airbag.

<p>
Seagal plays his full range of emotion from `Slightly irked' through `Pissed 
Off' to `Really Angry' again.  But he does it so well.  One great moment in 
the movie was his attempting to stand up to introduce himself to his `Anger 
Management Group'.  He gets stuck in the grade school desk chair and ends up 
ripping it apart to get free while explaining to the open mouthed facilitator 
that he isn't an angry person, he's a happy person.

<p>
So, great action.  Predictable story.  Best watched by an action fan,

<b>THE NCAA COLLEGE BASKETBALL SEEDINGS - RECAP</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Rick Desper did MUCH better than I did, but we both nailed the prediction
that Duke would win the tournament.
I suppose this really wasn't that difficult, because Duke won every game
by at least 10 points and never was pressed seriously until the Final Four,
but they did fall behind in both Final Four games and then came back.
It certainly was a deserved win, all whining aside. 
And as Duke teams go, it was one of the more likable ones we've seen
in the past few decades.
Player of the Year Shane Battier seems like a nice guy, Mike Dunleavy, Jr.
had a game of his life so far in the finals with Dad watching, and
Coach K seems more human after his illnesses of a few years ago. 
Some quick comments by region on my predictions:

<p>
<p><i>The East:</i> Boston College did NOT do well in the tournament, actually
none of the Big East did.
Then after the tournament was over, most of the top players have declared for
the NBA.  
More rebuilding next year, except that Troy Bell and the Eagles should come
back all the harder next year.
We forget how much Tournament Experience means.
Rick got Missouri and I was wrong about Georgia - perhaps those near .500
teams with difficult schedules DON'T belong - but Kareem Rush DID play.
Duke prevailed in a regional that did end up going at least close to form.

<p>
<p><i>The West:</i> I thought that Arkansas was ready for a run, but it 
was Georgetown, and they didn't even have to play Iowa State.  I did
note that Georgetown was the best of the 10's.
I also told you all to watch out for Jameer Nelson and Marvin O'Connor
for St. Joe's and almost called one of the upsets of the tournament.
St. Joe's just barely ran out of gas in what was arguably the best 
game of the whole tournament.
I should have realized that Maryland was the true class of this regional.
How could I not have picked them when I thought their opposition would
be Indiana, St. Joe's, and Arkansas???  Beat head against wall....

<p>
<p><i>The South:</i> I picked lots of upsets, but then seeing Michigan State
make the Final Four. 
That was right, but my upsets were very wrong.
I went with heart over head on Penn State vs. Providence and I really wasn't
surprised by Penn State's short run through North Carolina.
Plus I predicted Temple's run too.
But I thought Indiana State would play better and missed some other picks here.

<p>
<p><i>The Midwest:</i> How could I have picked Tennessee over Arizona.
Duh.....
Tennessee had great players, but no, they never could put it together.
Other than getting Arizona to the Regional Final, I really screwed up
this regional.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>The Women's Tournament:</i> Diana Taurasi - I think it was 1 for 15 from
three point range in the Semi-Final.
Yes, she has ice in her veins and probably having her keep shooting was the
best strategy, but I was wrong, they needed at least ONE of Shea Ralph or
Svet Abrosimova.
And I had Sue Bird winning MVP for the finals, I think she should have been
trying to score more in the loss to Notre Dame.
Very, very sad.
But I'm happy for Notre Dame.
They had the seniors, these UConn players who lost to them are mostly back
next year.
So watch out!!

I finally got around to reading the szine today and got a lot of chuckles
out of your hoop prognostications.  I guess the biggie for me is why no one
seems to want to give the Zags any respect.  About the only gimmee you got
was Duke and everyone is picking Duke to take the whole show.  The question
only seems to be who comes in second.

<p>
One writer in the Seattle Post Intelligencer made the comment that everyone
picks the big football schools to do well even though Gonzaga had a far
better record.  Now of course by the time this gets published it will be all
over but the shouting and we will know whether or not Duke needed to show up
or not.  But Michigan State????  Hah!!!!!!!  Tomorrow, Friday the 23rd,
Gonzaga plays again.  Where is Michigan State?

St. Joe's overcomes insult

<p>
The Tourney officials had a lot of damn nerve giving them a #9 seed after the 
season they had. I'm glad they won. The A10 has always been a much better 
league than people think. It was also fun to see the Big 10 crap out like 
they did. 

<p>
Its really too bad that the Tourney bends over backwards to kiss up to the 
big conferences. St. Joe's getting such a low seed and Richmond being left 
out altogether was inexcusable. 

<p>
WNY's only team in post season play died quietly in Pittsburgh last night in 
the NIT first round. Such is life at St. Bonaventure after Tim Winn.

<p>
Diana Taurasi is all that was advertised and more.  I haven't seen a frosh
play like this since Nykesha Sales, and I think Taurasi is even better.
What really makes me wonder is how good this team would have been, had
Svet and Shea not gotten injured!  Sue Bird is definitely coming into her
own now, and Taurasi has the skills to be a future superstar.  It's like
watching Ray Allen.

<p>
One of the Survivor sites has a ``complete" spoiler list.  I'm not looking.
This site has been reliable with spoilers.  They claim they got this list
before the game started, and it's been accurate for the first eight
ousters.  Yikes!  I am MUCH, MUCH less
convinced about my ``spoiler" than ever before.  I'm really waiting for the
``intrigue".  Simply voting off Kucha is such a BORING strategy.  You think
Elisabeth could be a ``Kelly" but my big worry is that she'll turn into a
``Colleen" and that Amber will be the ``Kelly", while Jerri is the
``Richard".

<p>
Actually, I think I would get along with Jerri in real life.  Well, maybe.
Like, I think Elisabeth is more likable, but in rl I'd be much more likely
to hang out with Jerri, or Jeff and Alicia.  At the beginning of the show,
I thought I would like Michael, but it's become increasingly clear that
he's simply mad as a hatter.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
The primary Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings'' rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Jack McHugh claims the Federation,
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
The other races in the game are the Klingons, Cardassians, Species 8472,
and the Vulcans.
We ONLY need two more, let's get this one going.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is now interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED and Breaking Away games.
I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.
Breaking Away has Jim Tretick, John Harrington, Rick Desper, and Eric Brosius signed up thus far.
We need six players.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
(BOOB to TURKEY): No, I haven't seen that ``end game statement" for
Arsenic yet, so I don't think he does exist anymore.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): If Nomar was a Yankee then George would just rent a new one
for the next two months.  The Sox' only chance was to pull too far away
early on for the Yankee's August free agents to catch them.  Not gonna
happen now.  Deal with it.  Yankees over Cleveland in ALCS.  Mets over
Braves in NLCS.  After that will you care?
<i>((Yes, but that won't happen.... Red Sox pitch, Red Sox hit, Red
Sox win.... I actually think it is possible, but not likely, that the
Yankees won't even make the playoffs.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Not too much happening.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DATELINE BERLIN): The kaiser wishes to report that a special messenger has been 
dispatched to bring succor and cheer to the Games Master during these trying 
times of a beer famine in Rhode Island. 

<p>
(BOOB to BERLIN): St. Patrick's Day made an excellent opportunity to consume
the contents of the special messenger package..... many thanks!
Now, let's take a peek into your barroom.....
                            
<p>
(DOWN AT THE BARROOM WITH SHREEVY):
I hadn't been at the Doo Drop Inn for a few days and felt the need for a 
bit of refreshment and conviviality. Wandering in, I found Crazy Henry 
giving a less than enthralling discourse on his poverty as a child back in the 50s. 
There was some drivel about his family not having had a television until 1956. 
Even Bjarne Tretickson was yawning. 

<p>
As I sat down on a stool between Big John and Shreevy, the latter finished 
a long swig from his bottle and stated, ``That's nothin'. 
Wait till you hear about the time my brother and me was at summer camp."

<p>
There was dead silence, then laughter. 
Even I had to laugh and to question how impressed any of us 
would be with this so-called hardship.   

<p>
``Well," Shreevy went on, ``there was this one year when my brother, 
Billy Bob, and me was hearin' about how great summer camp was and wanted to go. 
Our folks didn't have much money, but we kept on them. 
After a couple of fights and whippings, they said okay, git.

<p>
``Only it turned out that the camp we was sent out to was a lumber camp. 
This place was five miles outside of Ten Strike, Minnesota. 
This is the same hellhole where they started the fight to get the 
mosquito to be the official State Bird.

<p>
``Most all of what we made at camp went straight to the folks and we got 
$1.15 a day to spend and save for bus fare home. 
On Sundays we got the afternoon off to walk into town and have some fun. 
This wouldn't have been so bad, but the food was awful in camp. 

<p>
``When we had our first meal, my brother and me was choking and wanting 
to throw up. We both said something about how terrible the food was. 
That's when we found out that anybody that complains there about the food 
gets to be cook as their extra job.

<p>
``Well," I said to Billy Bob, ``all we gotta do is be bad cooks.
We tried and tried. Nothin' worked. Nobody said nothin' about the 
snail gravy one night and the way too much salt in a goulash that 
only brought a comment of ``a bit salty, but good.

<p>
``Finally, I had it. Billy Bob covered for me and I headed out into the woods. 
I found some meadow muffins. Some people call them prairie wafers. 
Anyways, I took them back to camp and got to bakin' some pies.

<p>
``These pies was coolin' when a big Swede come in, grabbed one and 
set himself down. He dug into it, ate a big bite and said, 
`That's moose turd pie!' 

<p>
``My brother and me looked at each other and smiled, until he said, 
`Good, though.' 

<p>
``Then we knowed we was stuck. Any way, we ended up the summer with 
enough money to pay our way home and we never, ever asked for summer camp again. 

<p>
``This wouldn't have been so bad, but when I got back to school the teacher 
asked the class to write about what they did for the summer. 
She didn't believe what I did and I ended up with a month of detentions for lying."

not entirely sure I understand the rules on this point, so if someone
could clarify I'd appreciate it.
I know that Naples is a special center that is a home center for

1) I am taking reservations for the Edward Teller game, which will
be the next NYEED 7x7 game in this series.
Since it was asked, I'll remind everyone that we will again be
playing the Black Hole Variant.
Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.
Karl Muller, Harry Andruschak, and Sandy Kenny are on board.
We need four more players?

Endgame Statement for NYEED</td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
So ends the second game of 7x7 NYEED, this time around with the skating rink 
variant. In theory, the maximum score could be 44.  In this game (not 
counting Gardner, who dropped out) the final scores were from 16 to 20, a 
razor thin margin by any standards. This duplicates the result of the first 
NYEED which also had razor thin margins. This shows once again that the 7x7 
version of NYEED is something quite different from the one-shot version. Will 
Jim use the skating rink version for the third game or revert to the 
impassable black holes variant? 
<i>((The ``skating rink'' version is lots more fun, isn't it?
That's the version we'll play.
You're playing in it, see above.))</i>

<p>
Sorry this is again after the nominal deadline, but we have had a death in 
the family. On 17 March I sprained my shoulder from patting myself on the 
back for making it to 17 years sobriety in AA.  The next day my 2nd cousin 
Megan died of a drug overdose from methadone and heroin. I have been trying 
to help the family to cope with this. I wrote about this for the Internet 
newsgroup alt.callahans, and Megan' sister Gabrielle also wrote a eulogy that 
I also published in alt.callahans.  I can send you copies if you wish, and 
you would have our permission to reprint them if you so choose.
<i>((Anyone interested can write to Harry, he and I decided that I won't
print them.
Sorry for your loss, I am familiar with the issues involved.
It is too bad Megan couldn't have found a way to assist people in
helping her out before that.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The RAG draw is defeated and reproposed.
Please vote on it with the next season's orders.
Repetition does not change the NVR=No, so if you don't vote it cannot pass. 

<p>
2) Note Steve Emmert's new address.
I don't have a new phone for him yet (same E-Mail).
And Drew James has a new address too, but phone and E-Mail stay the same.

<p>
3) I'm sorry, but there was a map mistake last time.
The German army was in Berlin, not Munich.
Always remember to check this since the orders, not the map, usually are right.

<p>
4) Thanks to Steve and Paul for playing out their positions!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GOZ to EMMERT): Well, my Blackhawks aren't going to make the playoffs
either.  Maybe they should play the Canadiens in a best-of-six match.  That
way nobody would win it.  I'll bring my own bag to wear.
<i>((Gee, Goz, do you ever support teams that actually have a snowball's
chance in hell of winning anything??
I think you're just a masochist!!))</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA - TURKISH CORPSE): Rauterberg don't drink no more. I on the other hand 
would be happy to accept a beer (might even have two) in order to give you a 
chance to begin your apology for your foul treatment of me earlier in the game.

<p>
(BOOB to RUSNAK): Haven't you been following the China situation?
Apologies, shmologies.... Americans never apologize!

<p>
(RUSS - GOZ): They wouldn't hold out if people weren't willing to pay out. The 
only part that should bother you is corporate tax deductions for big wigs in 
the rich people's seats. Try a little league game instead, they are far more 
entertaining.

<p>
(FRANCE to GERMANY): Now, if the win proposal passes, you are gonna give me
props for pinning down the Brits, right?  Assuming, of course, that Russia
or Austria don't sink the thing, and assuming you let me live here...

<p>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA AND RUSSIA): You guys both knew my time constraints on
this turn, and neither of you took much time to discuss things with me.
Let's do better this next turn, ok?

<p>
(JAMES to EMMERT): Come on - you are way over reacting.  There is no way you
can compare my move to Tunis with my stab last game.  This was at worst a
mercy killing of a terminally ill country with no chance to recover and you
should be grateful.  I'll be joining you in a couple of seasons in any case.
It isn't even in the same league with that beautiful slicing and dicing I
did for the solo win last time!  Don't try to give me a reputation I don't
deserve.  I'm in my current position due to my tendency to trust too much!

<p>
(JAMES to EMMERT 2): Speaking of stabs, I like the stab in the back that your
Spiders gave their conference by bolting to the Atlantic 10.  It probably
kept the Spiders out of the tournament.  My Orangemen had an excellent
season - given their talent level - but ran up against Kansas and were
crushed easily.  Beware - SU had an outstanding recruiting year and should
be a high powered team again in a couple of years.

<p>
(DREW ON BASKETBALL): My Orangemen only did slightly better than your 
Friars last week.  The
Big East looked good in the first round and then did terrible in Round 2.
It figures - G'town is the only team alive.

<p>
(GOZ to BOOB): So Randy Johnson throws a 98 mph fastball in Spring training,
hits and kills a dove.  And then they take the feathers and give them to
Bjork to wear at the Oscars.  Go figure.

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ):  That got my biggest laugh of the week!!!

<p>
(GERMANY to ITALY/TURKEY): Guys we hardly knew ye.  Please continue to flame
the rest of us in the press.

<p>
(BOOB to GOZ): I don't think they need too much encouragement!

<p>
1) Last chance for any more End Game Statements.
Note that we need TWO more players for the new game!!!
Please sign up.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
I would welcome some comments from Tom Howell on how he won this game.  Was it
just superior tactics, or did he use strategy?  For my part, I have no idea at
all how one would use strategy, so I'm looking for enlightenment.  I tried to
predict how the other players would move and take advantage of anything I could
deduce.  I also made agreements from time to time that I thought would help
both me and the person I was agreeing with (maybe Tom found better ways to do
this.)

<p>
At one point I made an agreement with John Schultz.  He thought I did not keep
my end of the bargain, but I think the problem was that my letter was delayed
in the mail enough that we were off by one round in our coordination.  I tried
to keep every bargain I made during this game.

<p>
Thanks,
Eric

(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``I am beautiful, like a dream, very authentic
so it seems; I never cry, nor ever smile, faking orgasms all the while.....
I obey, I am myself, Freedom, Power, Authority!''
Tom sings these stunning words on ``Authority'' off of <i>Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<p>
(SPANISH NATIONAL BUGLE): Earthquakes have struck for the first time in  
Madrid for the first time in 20 years on the once so pretty day of March.

<p>
The quake destroyed several buildings including the recruiting office on 
sirre and degreer. The death toll is currently at 13 wounded and 5 confirmed 
dead.
There was also consideration of sending in the National Militia to keep 
rioters and looters at bay.
<i>((Cool.... what press....))</i>

<p>
(UPN EXECUTIVES CONVERSATIONS WITH GENE RODDENBERRY): 

<p>
UPNE - We changed our mind, we want to run the show one more year!

<p>
Roddenberry - But I already wrote the finish.
The Romulan/Ferengi alliances smash the Federation. 
I wrote a surprise ending and I've sent feelers out to other networks.
Besides, the Federation is too far gone, how could I write them back in?

<p>
<i>((By the way, you do know that Mr. Roddenberry is deceased, an ex-writer....))</i>

<p>
UPNE - Have the Ferengi form an alliance with Cardassia and the Federation against
the Romulans.

<p>
Roddenberry - The Ferengi would have to be crazy to attack the Romulans.
Your scenario is not believable.
What about my reputation?

<p>
<i>((What do YOU care about your reputation, you're dead!!!
He's dead, Jim-Bob..... oh, never mind....))</i>

<p>
UPNE - Your reputation?!
You died five years ago!
<i>((Actually, it was more like ten.))</i>
What do you care?

<p>
Roddenberry looking reflective - Good point!
How about this.
We have the Ferengi ally with Cardassia and Federation, while at the same time Captain
Kirk makes a secret alliance with the Romulans.
The initial Federation/Ferengi attack of Romulan forces near the neutral zone is
flipped into a Federation/Romulan reversal.
The whole Federation/Romulan/Klingon alliance would be a first and the conflict
could be drawn out for the whole Hollywood season.

<p>
UPNE - Then it's a deal?

<p>
Roddenberry - Can I hire 7 of 9 as my personal secretary?

<p>
UPNE - Done!
 
<p>
(MADRID TRIBUNE BIZARRE MURDER CASE): Madrid has now suffered 3 brutal 
killings of unknown killers where the victims were apparently eaten.
<i>((See my bad jokes in the issue of <b>Deny Everything</b> elsewhere
in this issue.))</i> 
There is however one suspect that may have been involved with the murders 
or of the murders, but the Police and government has refused to give the 
individual's name.
Only one thing is certain - there are 3 deaths, all three eaten, yet 1 out of 
the three is now confirmed to have been eaten by a canine. 
The other two were apparently human.

<p>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG - PAST REFLECTIONS FOR TODAY'S GAMBLE): The deception alliance
with Ferengi is going well.
They just decommissioned one of their starships in the Neutral Zone two light
years from earth.
This strategic withdrawal has given me time to reflect back on my predecessor,
the evil Captain Kirk from the mirror universe by studying his personal logs.
The war started badly for the Federation/Klingon alliance.
The Borg had assimilated Bajor.
Unable to assimilate the Dominion, they formed an atypical Borg/Dominion alliance
and invaded the Klingon neutral zone.
The Klingons were on the verge of sure assimilation and conquest when a Klingon
scientist downloaded a nanoprobe computer virus into the Borg system net, killing
the Borg Queen and severing each Borg drone from the Collective.
This destroyed the Borg starcubes and liberated the Bajoran people.
The new Bajoran government allied with the Klingons to exterminate all
Dominion forces in the Gamma Quadrant and that alliance still stands today.
Back on earth, the evil Captain Kirk had an alliance with an alien group
called the Kragons.  The Federation had tried to communicate with these 
strange beings for years but failed because their odd form of communication
was unable to be sequenced by the universal translator.
This mystery was solved by Captain Picard on a mission to Kragon where he
discovered that the Kragons only talk by using metaphors instead of actual words.
Captain Picard's mission led to the alliance that my counterpart chose to break.
The Romulans and the Ferengi made war with the Kragons and they encouraged Kirk
to attack them as well.
The Kragons were a loyal ally but their odd form of communication frustrated the
mirror captain. 
The war was going pretty badly when the Kragons suggested an offensive attack of the 
Ferengi forces at Sector 31489.

<p>
(UKRAINE-ITALY): Sorry, there is no help for you.

<p>
(KENT POLLARD-JEFF AND ERIC): My first assumption was Eric did in fact black 
press in the szine. Now I do see that the petty dictator of Egypt could have 
easily done it. Next time either of you. You'll be eliminated by me...

<p>
(BERLIN to MADRID): Panic about something that you own.  I'll take easy 
care of Ham, okay?  Even if I lose Hel (and that is not a given by any 
means) he'll only have two units on the joint.

<p>
(TO BLACK PRESS WRITER): Just because this arcane practice is legal 
doesn't mean that I have to like it.  And I don't.

<p>
(BOOB ON BLACK PRESS): I am a big fan of Black Press, as we all know
by now.

<p>
(ROME-WORLD): My flipping days are over.  I am a mere shadow of my former
Ferengi self.  If you can't beat the O'Donnells, join 'em.

<p>
(SECTOR 31489 IS THE STAR TREK EQUIVALENT TO ``LET'S INVADE ALBANIA IN THE FALL EVEN
THOUGH IT'S NOT A SUPPLY CENTER''):
The evil Kirk agreed to the Kragon blitz that in the end almost cost the Federation
its very existence.
I just recently received a phony communication from the now deposed ``Sultan''
of Kragon calling me an idiot.
Mr. Kile has determined that the message could not have originated from the
``Sultan'' because the message was in easily understandable English, when
everyone knows that Kragons only speak in metaphors.
I also have to disagree with the content of the message calling me, or more to the
point the mirror Kirk, an idiot.
He was a kleptomaniacal, two faced, predatory animal with delusions of grandeur,
but he was no idiot.
I'm guessing that the phony message was sent by one of our enemies for the
purpose of enraging me into doing something stupid.
I like to think I'm more than capable of achieving stupidity on my own,
which brings me to my big gamble.
I have decided that it is in the Federation's best interest to sign a treaty
with the Romulans and assist them in the conquest of Ferengi and Cardassia.
I hope I'm not making the same mistake that the mirror Kirk made when he attacked the 
Kragons.
Only time will tell.

<p>
(ITALY-MORON): You're such a dick for.

<p>
(MORON): What's a dick for?

<p>
(BOOB to MORON): And if THAT's not a metaphor, I don't know what is.....

<p>
(ITALY-WORLD): I apologize for the crude high-schoolish humor, but I
couldn't resist.  Sean just continues to amaze me.

<p>
(UKRAINE - GERMANY): What's to explain?  You aimed Italy at me,
I attacked you.  Simple.

<p>
(ITALY-SPAIN): You can either hold your fleets in the doldrums for the
rest of the game or you can do something useful with them.  So do
something less moronic and go north, my lad!

<p>
(UKRAINE - BRITAIN): The move to STP was purely to keep Germany
out as before.  Be more than happy to help your marines land
on the continent!

<p>
(PAUL to DAVE): You can take your geeky Ukrainian lawyers, with their 
trail of underpaid minions, and you can....

<p>
(ITALY-UKRAINE): What would it take for us to make peace?
 
<p>
(EGYPT-SPAIN): You still haven't said anything that I can understand.
             
<p>
(BOOB to EGYPT AND ALL): Just to show how dense I am.... I just had to
be told ``who Q''.... uhh.... so I'm not sure you've said anything
***I*** can understand.
I'll have to go back and check everything out again.

<p>
<p><br> England (Mark Fassio):
 
<p>
Wow; cant believe this is over, but sure glad it is. But lets start at
the beginning, and thank Don Williams for having both the initiative to
start a game and the smarts to pick some of the best damn players in the
Hobby right now to fill it! I wasnt fibbing when I said earlier that this
is probably <i>the</i> best (or tied for best) game Ive played since I began
Dipping. You were all hard, skillful opponents, and everyone contributed to
the mayhem and skullduggery. It was a beaut, and we all owe Don for that,
as well as Pete for enduring the GM pains, and our tried patiences.
 
<p>
I entered this game for a variety of small reasons. One was to see if I had
``the right stuff" against a field of ``known pros," i.e., to see if my solo
Turk win in the <i>Dip World</i> zine was a fluke, or if I indeed could compete
with the big boys. Another reason for joining was that my ``quota" of games
was one less than I usually kept ongoing, so the timing was right. But
mainly I joined because I enjoy the hell out of Don Williams, and when a
friend offers up a game with good competition, well...he made me ``an offer
I couldnt refuse."
 
<p>
My style of play was indefinable. The Old Faz entered a game with the
intent of ``one ally, one enemy," and went for the two-way draw, or perhaps
a stab if the situation really presented itself. The More Recent Faz has
shied away from that style. Don was right when he told me on the phone that
Id ``changed" in outlook as of late; I have. If I acted in real life the
way Ive played Dip boards for the last 5 years, Id be classified as a
sociopath and be institutionalized. My intent this game was the same as
numerous previous attempts: do not form anything long-term; stay allied for
real until you feel otherwise; then make the cut. I acted every turn on
impulse. Im sure some of you were wondering how I could be so convincing
and whatnot...well, truth is, for that turn or turns, I <i>was</i> sincere. But
I found it easy to turn on a dime and switch alliances-and thats what I
did here.
 
<p>
One ``constant" in my style remained: the idea of analyzing player
personalities and skills, to enable me to triage eventual friends and
foes. I knew Don for almost 20 years, and he was the only one (besides
Kathy) in this game that Id played against. Don was to me like the old
USSR was to the US: a danger, a rival, but a ``known entity" that I felt
comfortable with, and vice versa. Steve, Chum, Boob and Bob were,
unfortunately, players with good reps that I knew little about. That made
them suspect and dangerous.
 
<p>
My original intent was to ally with France or Germany, and take it from
there. But Boob played a squirrelly opening strategy and had
overly-secretive moves (I dislike that style among allies), so I threw in
with the semi-secretive, but very communicative, Steve Emmert. Of all the
players this game, Steve and I probably burned up the most e-mail
(especially during my days at West Point) and I thoroughly enjoyed his
style, wit and gaming skills. By mid-game, my evaluation of the players and
my strategy (once Don and I began to discuss The Stab) was to eliminate
potential threats to me from the ``unknowns" and take my chances with the
``known" Don.
 
<p>
I respected Boob and Bob, but genuinely feared Steve and Chum. I am in awe
of their skills (and we bear witness to same in the World e-mail games,
with Steve winning solo and Chum with a 16-center). As such, I began to
encourage an attack on Russia, if only to divert an attack on me. We would
have crushed Bob had I not been talked into the stab of Germany. Granted,
it took little to persuade me, paranoid as I was getting over the eventual
``This board aint big enough for the both of us, Slim" confrontation I
envisioned with Germany.... gadzooks, could you see a crushed Russia, a
Germany at 8 or so, and me faced with that, a rogue Boob, and a scheming Don?
 
<p>
Anyway, I flitted from idea to idea until the summer of 1998, when The Four
met at Gettysburg. Aside from having a bodaciously good time, I schemed
what was perhaps the most detailed stab of my career: the stab/attack on G
and T.
 
<p>
Chum and Steve had worked with me as part of the ``Crush Russia" plan, and
as said before, Bob was on the ropes, Italian ``rescue" efforts or no. Don
helped persuade me that a large Germany was not in my interests, and from
there it was easy to work out a scheme. I dont remember all the details
(honest), because I dont keep turn-by-turn diaries, and I throw away the
previous issues of the zine and old e-mails. But there was a season when
Steve was to go for Gal(?) and Chum for Rum-and then theyd converge and
create a linear front vs. Bob. Don and I began a double/triple cross of
letters (coordinated with one another for ``joint story lines and plots")
and then began to orchestrate the moves of all concerned. Once that
happened, it pretty much set the rest of the games pace. I wish I had all
the minutiae of details to relate how much time and effort we spent in
planning for that-our phone bills mustve been more than the entire GNP of
Bangladesh at one point. From then on Don and I were teamed up, but he was
always using Jim-Bob as his flank check on me, never wanting to crush
Boob at the same time I did. That was frustrating.
 
<p>
In the North I feared the inevitable R/I would never break up, and I began
to feel Id made the wrong move in stabbing Steve, potential threat or no.
Luckily Chums skills were his usual legion self, and he kept Don engaged
while I nibbled my way Eastward. (It didnt hurt that I would occasionally
pass Dons intended plans to Chum, so his moves would be negated or
stalemated ``just for a season," thus engaging Italy longer. Two can play
that game.)
 
<p>
The stab on Don originally wasnt meant to be permanent, just as the stab
on Boob (once he joined E/I) wasnt necessarily fatal. But in both cases
the ``rolling stab" just sort of happened, and once you get forward in a
spot, you guys know that its pretty hard to voluntarily leave...I tried to
play Phony War with Don two or three times to spoof the board. In fact, the
2nd Great Lie (besides the Gettysburg Summer Stab) was when we snuck Don
into the East as yet another ``Flash Burn Victim" and had him tear up the
defense line. From there it was bump-and-grind for me. Even then, though,
Chums analysis (and Bobs urgings to a paranoid El-Donyo) made the game
into an inevitable stalemate. I planned for a one-turn window, to either
win or miss by a hair.
 
<p>
I wont belabor the game. I got lucky. But the key question is <i>why</i> I got
lucky. Why did Steve join me again and then torpedo your plans? Well, Im
not a mindreader. But Ill venture it was for a couple reasons:
 
<p>
* He and I had a game-long rapport and writing friendship that was only
approached (but not equaled) by Don. And because I felt guilty of all the
stabs I did on him, that friendship showed itself in my offering him a
survival and continued play.
 
<p>
* I used one of the stronger Dip fortes in my arsenal time and again, with
telling effect: I always made someone else to be more of a Bad Guy than me.
Don was always the evil twin in my family, lusting to crush Steve. Bob was
always the Evil Tsar, out for revenge without conditions vs. Steve. Chum
was always the gunslinger who pooh-poohed Dons schemes in the Balkans.
There was always truth in what I said; I just managed to word it in such a
way that I made myself the lesser evil in discussions. I think it worked 
decently.
 
<p>
* Having said all that, I used the best weapon a Dipper could have: I
communicated. Now, thats not to say that others didnt. But when all was
said and done, why did I win? IMO, because none of you took the time to
write and ensure that Steve felt secure or involved in the team. You
smugly assumed hed "logically" fight his first and most brutal stabber,
and didnt stay in close touch with him, if I guess right. No one other
than me offered him survival when I had the power to crunch him. All of you
had written him off. Even your offer of having him go to Mos was really
``our" offer, to keep his options open.  Just my opinion, but had you all
convinced him that you wouldnt eventually jump his bones if I got pushed
back (as I implied to him several times), he mightve been more inclined to
support you all. But look at his options: (a) hit Ukr and see the game end
with him alive and in his third capital, or (b) be your stooge, then have
me do something in a stalemate situation (such as back off), and then be
without a friend-subject to whatever revanchist whimsy you guys would
entertain. Given those options, what would you choose? Communication lost
you this game after 1907; pure and simple.
 
<p>
Anyway, Im hoping Don has a better memory than me when it comes to
discussing the Gettysburg Stab. We will all have ``varying shades of gray"
when discussing intent and results this game. But I moved as I did based on
emotion, on spontaneity, and on personality. Steve deserved to live, and
Im glad he did-regardless of whether he wouldve supported me. I just
felt bad to stab folks, and wanted him alive. If I couldve been sure Boob
wouldve stayed in the East, I wouldve almost let him live with PAR as
well...but Jim-Bobs wild moves made me skittish, and for that he had to
go. (Sorry, Boob.)
 
<p>
Russia and Turkey played well. Bob is a master defensive specialist, and
survived ``waves" of assaults without breaking. Bravo! Chum is a pro as
well; I think you just had a bad game here, Jim, helped in part by the E/I
Gettysburg schemings. I think the thing that turned me off the most from
true R or T dealings was the lack of meaty letters on a consistent basis. I
generally received three-or four-liners after 1902, and they did little to
expand potential cooperation...or to override the more prolific and dashing
G and I letters.
 
<p>
Thats really about it. Im going to play a new game now, and well see how
my Germany deals with other barracudas. Regardless of how I fare, its
irrelevant (at least for now). I loved this game and our interaction. I am
spent from two years of directed brain effort and scheming, and anything
else for this year is probably moot. I owe you all thanks for giving me a
great deal of enjoyment from Arsenic, and I hope I reciprocated in kind.
 
<p>
<p><br><p><br>Germany (Steve Emmert):
 
<p>
My, my, hey, hey.

<p>
Ar-sen-ic has gone away.

<p>
Its better to burn out

<p>
Than to fade away.

<p>
My, my, hey, hey.
 
<p>
Let me begin this where I absolutely must:
 
<p>
1. Thank you very much, Terry and Pete, for enabling us to play this game.
I have never published a zine, and almost certainly never will; I cannot
envision spending that much time laboring for the benefit of others in
something as small (in the context of life) as a Diplomacy game. I am
grateful to each of you.
 
<p>
2. Congratulations, Mark, on a solo in a singular game.
 
<p>
I will take many wonderful memories away from this experience, few of which
are related to the actual play of the game. I plan to touch on those later,
but will start my reminiscences with whats really important to me: The
friends I made.
 
<p>
I was surprised when I was reminded that this game was 1998A. I thought it
had been going on for longer than that. But it is to that time frame that I
date my acquaintance with Terry, Faz, OK, and Bob. (I had met Kathy
before, had played in Jim-Bobs and Petes zines, and had actually played
against Don back in the early Nineties.) Over that time, I can honestly say
that I have acquired friends to last me a lifetime. I will treasure the
memories of our version of Picketts Charge at Gettysburg; of a hot,
starlit July night in Veterans Stadium with Bob and the Phillies and
Braves; of an impossibly late night at WDC 98 in Chapel Hill, where we got
thrown out of bar after bar; of a string of correspondence too enjoyable to
describe accurately, on a variety of topics, only some of which were this
game. Long after anyone has forgotten the outcome of this game (well, maybe
long after everyone but Faz), I will recall that this was a fountain of
friends for me.
 
<p>
I was disappointed that Kathy didnt get more involved in the game. I
attribute her poor showing in this game to the obvious fact that she was
the only one of us not on-line, and that clearly hampered her ability to
negotiate as quickly and effectively as she needed to. Perhaps there was a
bit of ennui there, too; I suspect that of all the people that Don talked
into joining this game, she was probably the least inclined to join. In any
event, I think I got two letters from her, and that wasnt in keeping with
the legacy of the greatest player ever to draw a knife.
 
<p>
I recall Dons telling me early on that he felt that Bob had nothing to
prove by joining this game, and I think I agree with that. He certainly
didnt need to enhance his reputation in the hobby; it looked as if he was
just joining for the pure fun of getting in a game with some names from the
glory days of the hobby. And to think, I treated him so treacherously... Of
all the players in the game, I think Bob wrote the least other than Kathy,
but he did get right to the point, so I guess he needed fewer words. This
made me consider my own negotiation technique, which is generally much more
verbose, and wonder which is the more effective style. There are probably
times in which his style is better, though I believe in his case it was
just a matter of having comparatively little time to write.
 
<p>
On the opposite end of the spectrum is Our Champion, Col. Fassio. This was
(and, I will add hopefully, ``is") one of the most enjoyable correspondences
I have ever maintained, as our notes to each other were almost always long,
rambling, and filled with the stuff of life rather than just this game. In
many ways, Mark and I are complete opposites: Hes got a military
background, and Ive never tossed a serious salute in my life. Hes
Catholic, and Im... well, Im not. Hes a profane man from the coal fields
of western Pennsylvania; Im a genteel southern gentleman from-well, Im
actually from a small town in northern Indiana, but whos counting? At
least I have taken steps to civilize him, introducing him to the important
concept of the most valuable use of good bourbon and mint leaves. And I
think he was in earnest in stating the he liked it; I dont get the
impression that he was just faking it in order to get my support into Warsaw.
 
<p>
I have said many times, probably to most of you, that Don is the finest
strategist I have ever seen over a Dip board, and I do not mean that as
idle flattery. Its true. Of the three skills necessary to Dip success, I
flatter myself that Im fairly good at tactics, among the best at
communicating, but woefully inadequate as a strategist. In conversations
with Don, I could muse about one possibility for a move, and Don cold reply
instantly that the long-term repercussions would be adverse. Then he would
demonstrate why, and he was always right. How on earth can you see that far
ahead, I would wonder. He put it down to just playing a lot of Dip, but I
dont buy that. I wish I had that degree of strategic vision.
 
<p>
As many of you may know, Don tried in W 00 to sell me on a surprise attack
on Jim-Bob, whereby his initial move would be A Ven-Tyl-Mun, and thence
into Burgundy. I said not just no, but hell no; I certainly did not want an
Italian army wintering in Munich. (In retrospect, this is exactly the
degree of trust required by an Austrian playing the latest rage, the Key
Lepanto.) Something inside me will always wonder what would have happened
if I had gone along with that suggestion, but I wasnt ready to be nearly
that, shall I say, forward-thinking. Perhaps this had something to do with
Dons hand in the English stab that was my eventual undoing, but I doubt
it; he probably just saw that, down the line, I would be an unmanageable
threat to him unless he got a knife into my back. Cest la guerre; Ill
wait til the next opportunity, Don.
 
<p>
Jim-Bob Burgess will go down in Dip history as the first victim of the
Emmert Opening. Okay, it will be a footnote, and a small one at that. Two
hundred thirty issues of <i>TAP</i> give him a far better claim to Dip fame than I
ever will have. But the fact that he was still willing to talk to me while
I occupied his capital shows that he knows how to play. I believe J-B made
only one mistake in this game, but that was a whopper: Showing his
undefended rear to E/I after I left. Of course, the idea of sending a band
of gypsy soldiers into Austria was audacious; Im not willing to call that
a mistake just yet, and it sure as hell made for intriguing tactics.
 
<p>
I greatly enjoyed my correspondence with our wunderkind, OK. He displays a
mastery of tactics I cant emulate; I can just admire it. And anyone who
hasnt seen the OKelley sense of humor just hasnt been paying attention.
This is the guy who spoke out at WDC in 98 during the presentation by the
Belgian hosts of WDC 99, asking, ``What security measures have you taken to
protect us from Diplomacy hooligans?"
 
<p>
When Arsenic began, everyone marvelled at Jims 4-for-8 win record, and
wondered what kind of wizard this guy must be. Was he playing those games
against kindergartners? Well, nope. The kid can play. And in a day when Dip
openings are analyzed like chess openings, with articles on tactics,
strategy, and negotiation, Jim ignores the pundits and just goes out and
plays a great game of Dip. He and I never butted heads in this game, but if
we had, I think I would have feared trusting him more than anyone else; I
sense a ruthlessness beneath his eloquent, analytical exterior that must be
terrible to confront. Jim, Im glad I never had you behind me.
 
<p>
Despite all this ability in a game that rewards treachery and deception,
each and every player in this game is someone I have come to regard as a
true friend, in a way that will transcend the end of the game. Of all the
games I have played in my Dip career, this is the first game I can say that 
about.
 
<p>
This game also produced two colossal misunderstandings, for which I am to
blame. Mark and Pete, I have apologized to each of you privately, and now
Ill do so publicly. Thank you both for forgiving me.
 
<p>
I have gotten this far without mentioning what motivated me to make my
last, fateful move of A War-Ukr. If I dont discuss it here, I know Ill be
beset by direct inquiries.
 
<p>
There were several reasons for my move, upon which I did not decide until
very near the last deadline. The most compelling was this analysis: I knew
I would not win, and for all practical purposes, I knew I would not share
in a draw, either. (Mark said, quite believably, that he wouldnt vote for
a five-way draw, and I sensed that others would be disillusioned with such
a result, too.) The alternatives became survival or elimination.
 
<p>
Now, I dont like losing any more than Jim OKelley (``Win if you can; draw
if you must; but never lose."), but there were no other realistic options.
I knew that there were two ways I could be eliminated. Either someone could
make a mistake, or a group of you could decide, somewhere down the line,
that I was no longer needed, and paring the board down to four powers
wouldnt be such a bad idea... On the other hand, there was one way I could
abso-damn-lutely guarantee that I would survive.
 
<p>
There was a peculiar sort of satisfaction I derived from the knowledge that
my one, tiny army held the entire balance of the game. That army was, in
the end, more powerful than Marks sixteen units, or I/R/Ts seventeen.
Plus, I took home the prestige of being the Lord of the Three Capitals.
 
<p>
In truth, there were more reasons. Mark played a splendid game, and
certainly deserved to win. I noted from a look at the supply center chart
that he grew in each and every year, which is a remarkable achievement. He
was always on top of the tactical and strategic situation. In consideration
of all of the skills one brings to Dip, he was, at least in this game, the
best of us all.
 
<p>
Plus, of course, I wanted to punish Don Williams for having treacherously
inspired the fatal stab of me, but thats another story.
 
<p>
I thank everyone involved for making this the greatest Dip game Ive ever
participated in.
 
<p>
<p><br><p><br> Russia (Bob Slossar):
 
<p>
Ive never understood the importance most Dip players place on endgame
statements. After all whos been in a game and hasnt figured out what
happened by the time the game was over? Who wasnt in a game but figured
out what really happened by reading the endgame statements? Id have to
answer ``Not me" to both questions. That and the fact that Ive got to leave
for work in a few minutes will keep this short.
 
<p>
Thank you to Don Williams for organizing this game. It was my 1st Dip game
in about five years and I had a good time. Congratulations to Mark Fassio
on his victory, he played a superior game and deserved the win. I still
believe that Mark could have been stopped if Don had realized one season
sooner (as the rest of the board did) that Mark was going for the win.
Also, Mark could have been stopped by Germany had Steve decided not to hand
him the win. But it speaks volumes about Marks ability that he was able to
get Don and Steve to do his bidding at critical points of the game.
 
<p>
As for me, my play was indecisive. The years of not playing robbed me of my
confidence in my own judgement. It wasnt until late in the game that I
trusted my own judgement. Too often I listened/believed what others were
telling me even when my own opinion was different. I was punished on the
board (as I should of been) for the above.
 
<p>
<p><br><p><br> Turkey (Jim OKelley):
 
<p>
Is it too late to change my vote on Fazs resignation?
 
<p>
What a disappointing ending to a great game, and one that started out so
promisingly for my Turks. In Fall 1901, I took Ser with Austrias
permission and stole into the Black Sea. The last time I had pulled this
feat off, I rolled to an 18-center win by 1906.
 
<p>
I must admit I had thoughts of gobbling centers just as quickly in this
game. Alas, Arsenic and Old Farts did not pit me against the usual stooges.
I had Don Williams in Italy and Bob Slossar in Russia and the great Kathy
Caruso in Austria. Not to mention the pack of first-rate rats on the other
side of the board.
 
<p>
My first mistake was my choice of builds. Kathy wanted me to build F Con
and A Smy and send the army to Arm for an attack on Sev. That would get me
two Rum and Sev, she argued. I could then turn Ser over to her and still build.
 
<p>
But I wanted two builds and a shot at three-Rum, Bud and Gre-so I built A
Con and F Smy. In 1902, I planned to support A Bul-Rum from Ser, cut
support from Sev with F Bla, and move A Con-Bul and F Smy-Aeg. In the Fall,
Bul and Aeg would hit Gre, Ser would support Rum-Bud, and Bla would move to
Rum in hopes of buying it cheaply. I hoped to reduce Austria to a single
center (with Italys help) while cutting Russia out of the spoils and
gaining the initiative for the war against him.
 
<p>
Unfortunately, Kathy took one look at my A Con and decided that she was
better off without friends like me. She bumped Ser, cutting my support into
Rum, which bounced my moves from Bul and Con. Russia, meanwhile, order
Sev-Arm, which caused my move to Sev to succeed.
 
<p>
My second mistake was choosing not to defend Ank. Instead, I moved Con-Bul
as Bul attacked Gre. I took Gre but lost Ser. Meanwhile, Russia retook Sev
and waltzed into Ank. I was down one, and my chances of winning the game
disappeared. From that moment on, my goal was simply to stop anyone else
from winning.
 
<p>
I spent 1903 and 1904 heroically fending off Russia, Italy and Frances
rogue Balkan army. My favorite turn of the game was Fall 1904, when I
managed to stymie a Russo-Italian attack on Gre and Bul, and seize Sev. If
it hadnt been for France supporting the Russians into Rum, I would have
picked up a center that turn.
 
<p>
As 1905 dawned, Germany, played by Judas Emmert, stepped up his efforts to
broker an R/T peace in hopes of forging an alliance of the free peoples
aimed at stopping an E/I two-way. Bob and I were ready for peace. Three
years of warfare had accomplished little for either of us, so we worked out
a two-turn swap of Sev for Smy. Bob even offered to support my attack on
Ser, now an Italian center.
 
<p>
We were both on pins and needles as we awaited the Spring 1905
adjudication, each wondering if the other had lied to him yet again. And as
surprised as we both were to learn that the other had kept his word, I
think Don Williams was even more surprised to see Russia and Turkey, mortal
enemies since 1902, working together. Often to Dons chagrin, we continued
working together right up to the moment we were betrayed.
 
<p>
With the R/T war behind me, I concentrated my energies on defending against Don.
 
<p>
Don had me outgunned, at nine units to my five, but to destroy me, he would
need most of those units, leaving him with scant resources with which to
guard his rear against England. What he needed was two quick centers, which
would allow him to erect the units necessary to deter attack by his
scheming weasel of an ally, while the bulk of his forces pressed on against
me. My goal, then, was to avoid a two-center knockout punch.
 
<p>
I could not succeed with a passive defense, so I chose to employ an
aggressive, dynamic defense. I played turn to turn, and concentrated on
attacking his centers, hoping to replace my losses, thus minimizing his
builds. The weaker he looked, the more likely an English attack.
 
<p>
My defense proved remarkably effective. In 1905, I actually captured Ser
and Tri while losing only Gre.
 
<p>
I continued my stubborn resistance through Spring 1907, when Faz finally
stabbed Don. At that point, I accepted Dons peace terms, and started
helping Bob and Don coordinate a defense against a British solo.
 
<p>
When Judas took StP with British support in the Fall, all appeared lost. He
could deliver Englands 18th center if he so chose. Bob was ready to throw
in the towel, but I convinced him that we could stop England at 17 if we
invited Germany to take Mos and join our line. I backed up the argument
with a fairly complex set of moves that would have locked the board from
Pie to Mos.
 
<p>
Bob accepted my plan, and I took the offer to Judas, who also agreed. In
Spring 1908, Germany took Mos while Russia and Italy made the necessary
shifts in their lines. All that remained was for Italy to support himself
into Tyo and Gal, and voila, the stalemate line was ours.
 
<p>
When I received the Fall 1908 adjudication and read that the game had
ended, my first reaction was shock. Why would Faz agree to the draw? Then I
saw that the draw votes had failed, and I immediately assumed that Pete had
erred in declaring the game finished.
 
<p>
Only when my eyes fell to the map and I spied the letter E in Warsaw did I
realize that Judas had fucked us. What a disappointing (and premature) end
to an otherwise great game.
 
<p>
Faz, congratulations on a fine win. Ive wanted to play with you ever since
I read about your exploits in the General. Im glad I got the opportunity
here, and Im even happier that I got the chance to meet you. Well always
have Chapel Hill.
 
<p>
Bob, you were a better ally than an enemy. I hope the experience here was
enough to convince you to remain unretired.
 
<p>
Jim-Bob, it took awhile, but Im happy we finally managed to connect. I
look forward to meeting you at a future con.
 
<p>
Judas, I love you like a brother, but its going to take some time for this
wound to heal.
 
<p>
Don, what can I say? This game has taken me from Santa Monica to Chapel
Hill, from Cemetery Ridge to the Little Round Top. I dont know how to
thank you for the experience. I wish every hobbyist could have the
opportunity you gave me, the chance to play in a game where every other
player actually plays the game. I received more mail from some of the
players in this game than I have received from all the players in other
games Ive played. The volume of correspondence and the level of play were
just staggering.
 
<p>
I had a wonderful time, not just playing the game, but also chatting with
you during our many lengthy phone conversations; meeting you in LA;
drinking Juleps with you, Emmert and Fassio; and re-creating Picketts
Charge. Thank you for inviting me to play.
 
<p>
Fellas, when this game opened some two and half years ago, you guys were a
bunch of old farts in the eyes of this young Turk. Today, I consider you
old friends. Ill miss this game.
       
<p>
<i>((I had sent my End Game Statement to Pete too, but I guess he misplaced it.
I will keep looking for it on my end and might publish it next time.
I also think this will light the proverbial fire on the Duck's butt and
we shall see something other than Socrates' tailfeathers soon too.
Thanks to all of you for a GREAT game!!!))</i>
