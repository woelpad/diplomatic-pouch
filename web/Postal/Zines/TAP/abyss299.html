<br /><br />Happy New Year, remember that next issue is the big.... 300!  Send me something for 
that issue.  
Do it now...... 
I also had my seemingly New Year annual "loss of E-Mail" where I typed something wrong
and blew out some E-Mail.
If I didn't respond to something in the last month, or it isn't in here and should
be, let me know.
I think I have everything I have for issue #300 properly saved elsewhere.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We've got a new subszine in this issue from W. Andrew York.... Andy's initials are
WAY, so we've got <i>By the WAY</i>.... get it?
Andy's starting out by running the ubiquitous "By Popular Demand", so please jump
in and play, I know I am going to play.
We also have some other subszines and a hint from Rip Gooch that he might be back soon.
Other big news (see more below) is that Tim Haffey has resigned as <i>Diplomacy World</i>
lead editor; however, I have located a replacement, Andrew Neumann is going to join
us from the Bad Ass Bay Area club that Edi Birsan and Adam Silverman have been building
up in recent years.
Andrew's going to do a great job, and support him by writing articles, E-Mail
him at andrewneum of gmail.com.
Join the diplomacyworld group on Yahoo to see all the electronic issues as
they come out and for more news.
Another short, quick issue leading up toward next issue's biggie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.

Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the

He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that

But Peter is now clearly back and appears in most issues!!!
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.

You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR KEVIN TIGHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a very special "search for" coming up in issue #300, and I'm
going to offer a hundred buck reward for that one, so I'm also going to 
up the ante on Kevin through issue #300 to $1 billion dollars.... no,
make that $100, can't quite afford to be THAT generous.
There have been some recent "sightings" of Kevin Tighe.
You have one more issue to find him for a hundred bucks!!!
And he's the reason I first started this feature (for those of you who
don't recall) and he's the one I continue to be most interested in finding.
This may take a bit of real detective work, but as a hint, like many of
us Diplomacy players, I believe he is out there making money on some
of the poker circuits.
I also would like ALL of the previous found people who are still getting
the szine to write me SOMETHING for the 300th issue for this section.
I know I've been having Doug Beyerlein write me lots of little notes
along the way, not all of whom I've been printing, and so I have some
things from him already.
But he may want to send me something else.
What should you write?
Something on what you've been up to, a reminiscence of Diplomacy times
or friends past, whatever, it's up to you, but I want something from
as many of you as possible.
While we're at it, some of you other old timers still getting the
szine (you know who you are, but I'm thinking most particularly of
people like Tom Nash, Dan Stafford, Bruce Geryk, and Steve Hutton,
most of whom were once szine editors) also should write me something!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark D Lew (Fri, 30 Dec 2005 12:36:48 -0800)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I haven't piped up about the A's recently.  Been crazy busy.
<i>((Yeah, join that club, I always forget how the holidays does that to you,
especially us singer types - though my singing load was slightly lighter
this year.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I read a lot of columns suggesting that the Milton Bradley trade was a 
change in direction for Billy Beane, but I don't see it that way.  It 
was classic buy-low, sell-high.  Yes, of course, Bradley is a risk, and 
not just because of his attitude.  There's a good chance he won't work 
out at all. On the other hand, there's a possibility he'll be great, 
and a possibility he'll be good. You make your best estimate of the 
probabilities and that's the value of the player.  It's not like 
the whole team has been rearranged around Bradley, so if he gets cut in 
April it won't ruin the team.
<i>((Yup, I understand completely.
You know, putting an entire team together in the Beane style is like
that, you have a whole host of interconnecting probabilities and
then if something doesn't work out you have second and third options
already lined up.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the flip side, Ethier is also someone who may or may not work out.  
Yes, he was the second hottest prospect in the A's system (after 
Barton), but he's still just an outfielder who hit very well in AA and 
is untested elsewhere. Maybe he'll be great, or maybe he'll be the next 
Adam Piatt (another one-time Texas League MVP, whom Ethier compares 
closely to).  Piatt was a decent major-league player for a little while 
but certainly not a star that one hates to have given up.
<i>((I should certainly say so.
People always have a tendency to overrate the second level prospects.
And the true stars are few and far between.
And even within that, pitching of all kinds and pitching prospects especially
are worth much more than outfielders.
Corner outfielders are the most dime a dozen commodity in the market right now.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The point is, Ethier's market value is at a high point right now, 
thanks to his stupendous season at AA. Meanwhile, Bradley's already 
depressed market value was shoved down even further by the post-DePo 
management in Los Angeles, to the point where if no one were buying 
they'd have to give him away for free.  In terms of estimated probable 
value to the team, Ethier for Bradley - which is how the trade is 
commonly characterized - is about a wash.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What makes it a bargain is the part everyone leaves out.  Oakland 
actually got two players in the deal, Bradley plus middle infielder 
Antonio Perez.  Not that Perez is all that, but the fact that it was a 
two-for-one deal is what makes it a good deal for Oakland.  Beane has 
had his eye on Perez for a long time, and I wouldn't be surprised if 
the inspiration for the deal was focusing attention on the Bradley 
aspect in order to wheedle out Perez as a "throw-in" - sort of like 
how in 2001 he wheedled Mark Ellis from KC under the guise of trading 
prospects for Johnny Damon.
<i>((In the "probability model" more players is always worth more,
so getting two for one is generally better, since you have "diversified
your risk" just the same way you do if you take one stock and sell it
to buy two others.))</i>

There's a great comment about trading from Atlanta's John Schuerholz,

 answering a question about how he seems to have gotten the better of 
Beane in the deal for Tim Hudson:
"My view is that when you make a deal, the most important thing is to 
make your team better. The next most important thing is to make the 
other team better...because if you do that often enough, there's going 
to be a lot of guys lined up to do a deal with you. That's always been 
my philosophy in the 25 years I've been general manager. Why would you 
want to do anything else? So somebody writes something or says 
something about what a steal we made...I don't care about making 
steals. I care about making our team better. And the second most 
important thing is that, hopefully, the other team gets better."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The same thing applies in any multi-player game, particularly one 
that's all about the trading, like Monopoly. (Monopoly, incidentally, 
is surely the most underrated game on Board Game Geek. Not that it's a 
fabulous game, but it's not nearly as bad as it's made out to be by 
people who played it incorrectly as kids and never bothered to learn 
the real rules.)  Every trade in Monopoly improves both of the trading 
players at the expense of the other players who don't trade.  Thus, the 
best way to win is to be the guy who does the most trading.  The idea 
is not to make a rip-off trade in which you snooker the other guy.  The 
idea is to make a whole lot of win-win trades with all your opponents.
<i>((Diplomacy is the same kind of game as well, and more so.))</i>

That said, I think Oakland got the better end of the 
Bradley-Perez-Ethier deal.  But if Ethier turns out to be great for the 
Dodgers, so much the better.

<i>((Up here in New England all discussion had revolved around the
so-called "disaster" of Johnny Damon going to New York.
I think the deal has to be seen in light of the fact that the Yankees
are WAY over the salary cap, so this ensures that essentially they are
paying a marginal tax rate of 40% on Johnny's contract for all four 
years (that makes the</i> $<i>13 million contract an</i> $<i>18.2 million contract,
and does ANYONE think that is not overpaying for him???).  So, yes,
the Yankees have possibly the league's best hitting lineup, but they
will have trouble adding anything else without paying that 40% tax
while the Red Sox have some flexibility now.
And this will happen for four years now.
It's not that the Red Sox won't miss Damon, but they couldn't afford
to come anywhere close to that contract, and I don't think the Yankees
really could either.
But they and we will see.
This is more or less the same thing that happened with Pedro Martinez last year.
That was the best decision too.
I like the way the Red Sox are going, but it is quite a reorganization
of the team.  
The latest is that Kevin Millar, who is pretty well useless and won't be back, 
says that the Red Sox are making a big mistake breaking up the team.
Yes, really.
Well, if the psychology of the players like that matters, I guess we'll
find out this year.
But I doubt it, baseball really is pretty much an individual game.
Unfortunately, Goz is right, the kind of game that the Yankees and Red
Sox are playing is not like the game that the others are playing.
But the Red Sox are trying to act like the A's while spending up to the
tax limit.
And the Yankees are set to keep playing above the salary cap for at least
the next four years, so every new player costs them the tax.
And George doesn't care.
And the Red Sox will make at least one other big deal before the day
is done (possibly the big Lugo/Ramirez/ where they give back up Andy
Marte that they got from Atlanta earlier in the offseason) that will
shore some of their current holes up.
The Red Sox can still spend more money before they have to start paying
the luxury tax since they lose Damon's salary.))</i>

Especially, contact Rip Gooch for Railway Rivals,
see Rip's subszine elsewhere in most issues of <i>TAP</i>.
Come on, help me out!!!
Contact Rip Gooch directly at xyropedes of canada.com.
Rip has been a bit missing in action lately, but I am assured that he
SHALL return.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm ready to start a new Breaking Away game, who's interested???
Challenge David Partridge again as he is in, so are 
Brendan Whyte and Alexander Woo.
Anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game if there is enough interest!!!
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.
We have Karl Schmit and Sean O'Donnell on the list, let's get seven!!
It's FREE!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly or you can look at them at
www.variantbank.org.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'll try to remember to punch in the rules in the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough and Bruce Edwards are interested, anyone else?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, Dave Partridge, and Eric Ozog are signed up for that.

I'M TRYING TO TAKE OVER Phil Reynolds' two regular Diplomacy games somewhere in <i>TAP</i>.
One is going to Harold Reynolds' subszine, since Colonia is over and I'll take the other.
<b>
I am calling for orders from everyone NOW, and whichever game looks easier to start I
will give to Harold, but I'm getting no response.
Should we just shut these down??</b>
I have Phil's last issue, #44, but that was published way back in December of 
2003.
I'm not sure if people have moved or whatever in that time, so a little help would
be appreciated.
And I hope everyone comes back, but I might need some standbys. 
I'm going to start nagging so I can get these restarted.
Please let me know if you care playing, thanks to Karl Schmit for responding
each time that he's in....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England), 
John Power (Germany), Tim Snyder (Italy), and Fred Wiedemeyer (Russia)
are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.
Paul Risner probably is not going to be able to continue in the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can find that last issue of Phil's szine at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/ishkibibble/ishkibibble_44.pdf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Call for orders is NOW, the next season after the results above.
You should already have submitted these before.
Then I'll give one of the games to Harold.
I'm not getting any traction or writebacks on these games, does everyone just
want to abandon them???

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, but rather than hold up
the game anymore, Eric Ozog has agreed to pay attention to the game and
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
We all hope this will be a brief interlude.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I have a discrepancy on Buddy's cell phone number.  Note above I
have x5771, while below in his press he says it is x5571.  One is 
a typo, the other is correct.  Could Buddy or someone please clarify?
Thanks!
Note also that the postal service is NOT delivering to Buddy's current
address yet (this is an amazing thing to me, but I guess in growth areas
happens), so you have to mail to him at his OLD address even though
he doesn't live there any more.
Confusing to me and to all of you and sorry for the confusion.
E-Mail him, that's probably best.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I made a mistake in using the correct Austrian orders last time, 
and I verified this with Internet time stamps.
Thus, here is Fall 1902 again with new Austrian orders.
I have Winter orders from most of you and have held some press that revealed
what you intended to build (Yes, Jeff, this includes you!
So to the rest of you, you'll have to wait for the next installment.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROM FRED): I am appreciative to Eric for playing the game as it is, 
not basing his play base on "old friendships" as it appears Uncle Bernie 
might have expected. 
Really, what else is Germany to do with all those armies?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LON to PAR): For what's it's worth, Terry had said he would go after you 
too if you didn't stick with the western triple.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROM FRED): Life is life, Diplomacy is just a game, Merry Christmas 
and best of luck and health to all, esp. Uncle Bernie and Mr. Terry.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected, there are no new proposals.
We're off the draw clock, as seems clear at this point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I did lose some E-Mail (see top of szine) and I worried that Dan's
orders might be among them.
I could not contact him, so I decided to extend the deadline ONE more
time.  
If Dan does not respond and get orders in, a new standby will be called.
