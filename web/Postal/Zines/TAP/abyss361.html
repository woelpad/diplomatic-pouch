<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, the chemotherapy goes on through the summer just to be sure, but I passed
the CT Scan pretty well, the main cancer is gone, there is no need even to
consider surgery.  I pretty well, though the chemotherapy somehow seems to be
worse since the cancer is pretty well gone.
I'm even eating more than I was before, and soon I'll have to stop eating so 
I don't gain too much weight.
Staying REALLY hydrated is the key, that with lots of fruits and vegetables 
has helped immensely.
Thanks for everyone's good thoughts, they helped too!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Doug may or may not be winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.
My intent right now is to do that.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to do that, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
If you looked before, I was having some problems with updating, but I've corrected
them, so you should be able to see everything there.  The address is still:
/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the new list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I'm going to sending the link
in the announcements, we'll see if that helps.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a

The italics DO show on the web page just fine.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Wow, lots of action, I prefer "NAO" as the abbreviation for North Atlantic Ocean,
but it definitely is the case that "NAT" also can be used, and thus the attempted
Russian order fails.
Some good press too!!! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PRESS): The Times reports that the pubs in London are stocking up on French wine.  
"We understand that there is a real shortage of good claret's across England," noted acclaimed pub-hopper Lord Tanksalot. 
"Publicans are looking forward to French sailors bringing their gold louis' and their desire to spend liberally, 
while many adjoining establishments are stocking up on perfume and new bed linens," he chuckled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(VIENNA): The Austrian leader, Herr Orczog, was brooding in his study, contemplating the treachery of the Russian Czar Roadworm. 
Then the door opened. "Your Excellency!" said the ambassador to Italy. 
"Her Grace, princess Holley, sent you a spumoni with her compliments."
"You idiot!" said Orczog. "How does one keep a spumoni frozen all the way from Venice when it is 1903?"
No doubt this was some trickery of Her Grace. Herr Orczog remembered about the exploding bratwurst that did in the Archduke Ferdinand. 
"Well, taste it!" 
Gingerly, the ambassador ate a spoonful. Miraculously, he did not collapse.  
This was an interesting development, thought Orczog. Maybe there is some hope after all, if only a brief respite from near certain doom. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BENITO MUSSOLINI to ALLIES): "Let us have a dagger between our teeth, a bomb in our hands, and an infinite scorn in our hearts."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS):  The French Premier noted that he expects to celebrate Christmas 1903 in London.  
"I hear it is a miserable place to be in the winter, unlike our beautiful southern shores, 
but I’m told that Buckingham Palace is quite warm and welcoming, I look forward to sleeping there for the holidays," he stated.   
"I hope our friend the Kaiser will consider Christmas in Scotland, perhaps we can lift our glasses to celebrate 
joint victory in the west and the end of the British menace.   To our Irish friends, your freedom and independence is our guarantee... join us!!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS): All's quiet on the eastern front... as it should be.   Happy New Year!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM to GANG): "Violence isn't always evil.  What is evil is the infatuation with violence."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(E to ANYONE): No offers?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ENGLAND): "Can't we all just get along?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(E to GM): Are all the satellites and cables silent?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM to E): One wonders....

1) And we go on...

2) There is a re-proposal for the EFA draw, no vote vetoes it.  It was defeated last time. 
Please vote with your Summer orders, or get your Fall orders in by the deadline and we'll process it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND): Attempts to vote public yes to EFA draw.  <i>((I should just note that such a statement is
not binding, and he could say that and still be vetoing it, the draw nevertheless is reproposed.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to WORLD): Yes, I have 17 dots, but am still voting for the draw.  
I can't hold SMY and it will be a long slog to get two others.  
I know that France and AH will coordinate and make it tough.  
This has been a well played game which has gone on for years.  Time to move on.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
Harold Reynolds loves to play those games seeing what you can make of anagrams of names or phrases.
I really love that "The Abyssinian Prince" can be anagramized into "An inane, bitchy pisser".
What could be better than that??
That's all this rag is, especially since I no longer print it on paper!!!
But I probably do like better one of the alternatives, "The spicy, insane brain".
And best of all, "The Game of Diplomacy" becomes: "O My God! I'm a felt peach!!!"
On that fuzzy note, good night to all, and may you face one another on a Diplomacy
board very soon!!!</b>
