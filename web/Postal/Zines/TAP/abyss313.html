<br /><br />I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yes, this is really, really late.  Work this year with my job switch has been
completely out of control.  I am using the szine as a sign of this, that my 
life will be back into some semblance of balance once I get this szine back
on track.  I mean that to happen now, but who knows, maybe I am not anticipating
well.  In any case, enough of that, you want to get this going again.
I have limited some of the really, really out of date stuff, but yes,
the Red Sox win the World Series again!!!
I knew it was done in I think it was Game 6 of the AL Championship Series
when J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Drew came up with the bases loaded early in the game. 
He has had a tough time with the Boston fans and his contract this year.
But I think it has been a year of adjustment for him and he is going to 
be a great Boston Red Sox player in the next few years.
He is very calm and has taken his troubles this year in stride in ways
that the impatient Boston fans just don't seem to appreciate.
Anyway, after ALL the difficulties, after all the comments, 
I turned to Charlotte and said, J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp; is going to hit a home run
right here, and he needs to do it, to turn his season around.
On the next pitch, over the fence (and he's had almost no power all season),
and the grand slam was there.
Right there, I knew the World Series was won and had no serious tension in 
any game from there on out.
The poor Colorado Rockies had a great finishing stretch but they really 
were just completely outclassed.
I always think and say that we are all defined much more by how we deal
with adversity than how we deal with success.  
That's why I like baseball so much, since it's filled with adversity.
And J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;is a good guy and was a good signing for the Red Sox.
As I write this back a month or two ago, we were trying to get the 
other really good guy we need to
sign for next year, Mike Lowell, into the fold.  If we didn't sign Lowell
then SOME people would have wanted to sign A-Rod and A-Rod does NOT handle adversity
well and I have zero desire to see him as a Red Sox player.  
This view is commonly held here in New England.....
anyway, updating more recently, of course the junior Steinbrenner stepped in
and around Scott Boras to sign A-Rod for the Yankees, which ensures the
Yankees won't win another World Series for another decade.
And, Lowell is resigned for Boston so that they basically return everyone,
with lots of the young players lobbying for more playing time.

Doug Kent is continuing to produce great issues of <i>Diplomacy World</i> on
schedule, and the most recent 130 page monster hit the Century Mark.
Think about contributing, most of you reading this have something to say.
Even if you just want to write a short note, do so, please.
You can send things for <i>DW</i> either to me or Doug.
The other big news is that the new Diplomacy National World Cup is 
ongoing, more on that below.
And, I've been having fun actually playing Dip again.
So I have been busy, just the szine hasn't gotten to the top of the list.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the

Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave

and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York has been my most frequent subszine guest lately!!!
He's been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And so has Doug Kent, so we have a full stable of subszines.
And Michael Lowrey gets his in every few issues too!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JERRY JONES</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With the 100th issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i> upcoming, the ONLY
former publisher who has not definitively been located is Jerry
Jones.  Doug Kent and I have some idea where he is, but we've not
succeeded in getting him to respond to us.  Find him and win
a fifty dollar prize.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no
ISE.
If anyone still needs assistance with this, though, since I'm helping
John out, like if you're in a foreign country and need to send dollars
for dipping things to someone in the US, I may be able to help you out.

See the Yahoo Group wm04-results for more information and 
for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Finals are now 
into 1903.  
You can join the Yahoogroup too!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the finals are Mike Tombu as Austria, Mike "Smacko" McMillie as
England, Jerry "JT" Fest as France, Georg "Shef" Kotschy as Germany,
Randolph Ruff as Italy, Michael Weinzimer as Russia, and Tim Sweeney
as Turkey.  If you had asked me before the game started, I would have
been very worried about the central powers and seeing a collapse toward
the center of the board.  At the end of 1903 Georg made an error in trying
to remove a non-existent unit, so his Fleet Sweden was removed by default.
This leaves him with only three units left, and Smacko will easily be able
to take Sweden in 1904, already having Denmark.  
Anyway, my advance musings (you'll have to take
my word for it that I made them before knowing any results) came to pass
in the West, but not really in the East.  Smacko and JT are running away
with the game so far, with Smacko having six centers and JT seven.
Shef has only Kiel and Munich to go with the abandoned Sweden, as JT
already has Berlin and Shef is pretty well surrounded.
The key question (as Smacko built fleet Edinburgh, but JT built fleet
Brest) is whether EF stays together now.  Michael only has the four
home plus Rumania, Turkey has only Bulgaria, Italy is now up to five
having taken Greece and built another fleet Naples.  Otherwise, the
Eastern powers (especially Mike Tombu in Austria) seem pretty moribund
with not much going on.  Not a stellar WorldMasters final so far, but
we can hope it picks up.
The very latest, as I write today, is that Smacko and JT are still 
sweeping the board with no serious "stop the leaders" coalition forming.
Expect Smacko and JT to stick together until near the end and then
you will see some top-flight maneuvering to see who might get the solo.

Hi Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You're probably tired of this question, but will we be seeing another issue 
of <i>TAP</i> soon?  It's been a few months, I think, since I got one.
<i>((Yes, yes, obviously here we are.
I've avoided publishing the other kind notes I received on this.
Thanks for everyone's concern.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyhow, here's a brief letter I'd like to ask you to publish, unless you can 
tell me the best person (people) to ask privately.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I am looking for a copy of an article I wrote long ago, called <i>The 
Astonishingly Arrogant Ankaran Assault</i>. It was published, I believe, in Allen Wells' 
zine <i>DOT HAPPY</i> in the early or mid 1980s.

And when I do, I'm going to give out three sets of awards and get caught up for the

We were running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but might next issue.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.
It's always great to talk about the Mekons, as Eric Ozog does below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  You send me three tunes for the first turn,
and then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23.
If you missed the first turn, you can still catch up by sending five tunes next
issue, and guess on submitters to this issue.
I am also submitting my tunes.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I will tell you who the submitters are).  For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: 
Quite a number of you SAID you would join but haven't yet, so we'll get started and
put the pressure on you.
This part is still a MESS and I'm getting this issue out and then will catch up next time.
I think I'm going to simplify the rules to get it back on track.

I was thrilled to hear on KEXP (local independent radio) that 
The Mekons would be in Seattle in October.  
The last missed opportunity for me to see the band was sometime around 2000, 
when they played on Labor Day at the Bumbershoot music festival, 
but I was trapped filling in for a coworker on that day.  
"I could have been in downtown Seattle seeing The Mekons," I grieved to myself, 
"Instead I'm raking the compost" (of a public restroom-what's wrong 
with this picture?).  I guess that's the dedication of a Ranger, 
performing the ultimate in public service.  
But that was the last time: I am thankfully in a different job-pushing 
paper instead of pushing the poop around.  
I've been a fan of the Mekons-this eccentric, irreverent, 
rock/punk/folk/c&amp;w/reggae band-since 1989, 
when I bought <i>The Mekons - Rock 'N' Roll</i>.  
I think what really turned me on the most was Sally Timms' 
vocals and Susie Honeyman's fiddle.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As the date of the show got closer, I was debating 
whether to make the 50 mile drive, on a weeknight, 
with work the next day.  Then I came to my senses: 
"don't be an Old Man, go see the Mekons for Godssake!"  
So I bought and printed my own ticket from Ticketmaster 
and raced down the I-5 freeway in my '78 Mercury Cougar.  
After parking in the Seattle Convention Center garage, 
I walked around the blocks a couple times in a downtown 
disorientation haze until coming upon the venue, the Seattle Town Hall, 
a Greek-Romanesque building that looks like a mini version of 
Chicago's Union Station.  I made it in time.  
Inside the hall are arches and wooden church pews for the audience, 
and seven empty chairs on the stage. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had been thinking about ordering the new Mekons album, <i>Natural,</i> 
from Amazon.com but decided, "Hey, what am I thinking-I'll 
buy it straight from the band!"  
So I walked up to the table and bought <i>Natural</i> from 
Sally Timms herself.  Jon Langford, Lu Headmonds 
(he just drew a smiley face), and Sally autographed the lyrics liner, 
writing, "To Eric, Love Sally." 
Now Amazon doesn't hold a candle to that level of customer service!  
I said to Sally that I was a long time fan, and she replied that 
"most of our fans are, and that is part of the problem."  
I guess there aren't as many younger Mekons converts, 
but the audience had quite a few 20-somethings in it, 
as well as middle aged and older baby-boomers.  
The church pews were about half-occupied by their adoring fans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I really didn't know what to expect when The Mekons first 
walked out on stage, as they billed the concert 
"A Quiet Night with the Mekons."  
I thought this might be a "Mekons Unplugged" show with only 
2-3 of the band members.  I looked for the drums with fear-there 
were none!  But I was thrilled and relieved when seven 
Mekons entered the stage and promptly sat down in chairs, 
opening with "Give Me Wine or Money," from their new album <i>Natural</i>; 
a song that sounds like a tin can on the CD but has the 
Big Sound when played live!  Besides Jon (who sang in his usual 
gruff voice, played the guitar and thumb piano) and 
Sally (vocals), Rico Bell played the accordian, Sarah Corina on bass, 
Steve Goulding on a drum kit that he sat on and played 
(surprisingly it produced a lot of sound), 
and Lu played some kind of a sitar-looking guitar.  
Alas, though, Tom Greenhalgh wasn't there (his wife was 
having their fourth child-he had text-messaged Jon 
announcing the birth), and Susie Honeyman was absent 
(no explanation given), with someone named Jessica 
playing the violin instead.  She played well, but the 
fiddle tended to get drowned out by the rest of the band-Susie 
would have insisted on cranking it up! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Natural</i> isn't the strongest album by the Mekons, 
and some of the songs sound rather tinny when compared to 
<i>Oooh! Out of Our Heads</i> and <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>'s 
production, but these songs came alive when the 
Mekons played them in concert: "Dickie Chalkie &amp; Nobby," 
"Burning in the Desert Burning," and "Zeros and Ones."  
I particularly liked the moody "Dark Dark Dark," from 
an English poem "The trees stare back and we burn in smoke, 
reflecting in the water like ghosts," and they closed with 
the achingly haunting "Perfect Mirror," "The black mountain, 
above the lake, the trees are dead, a cold rolls off the water."   
This is the first time I heard the new album's songs-live-the 
way they are meant to be.  The Mekons also played "Diamonds," the pretty 
"Hope and the Anchor" (solo by Sally), and "Cockermouth" from 
<i>Natural</i>, with its reggae twist about the 
end of the world, as Jon Langford asked the audience to sing along, 
"You don't have to believe in the end, you have to believe 
this is the end."  The Mekons always had a sense for the sardonic 
about life, death, and our way of life in their songs: 
"Take it home right away, you've got three years to pay, but Satan 
is waiting his turn" (from "Sin City" on <i>Honky Tonkin'</i>).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
About half of the songs the Mekons played were from <i>Natural</i>, 
and the other half were songs from other albums: 
"Tina" (from <i>Journey...</i>. "It looks like an accident, 
caused by the government"); 
"Thee Olde Trip to Jerusalem" (from <i>Oooh, Out of Our Heads</i>...
not a song I particularly like, but it sounded great live, 
with all the band members singing together); 
"Wild &amp; Blue" (from <i>Curse of the Mekons</i>); 
"Millionaire" (from <i>I Love Mekons</i>); 
the country &amp; western rocker "Hole in the Ground" 
(from <i>Honky Tonkin'</i>, where Jon invited the audience 
to whistle along at the end (I can imagine Jake and Elwood Blues 
singing this song at Bob's cowboy bar).  The final encore song was 
"Ghosts of American Astronauts" (from the album <i>So Good It Hurts</i>, 
which I own on vinyl: "A Flag flying free in a vacuum, 
Nixon sucks a dry martini, Ghosts of American astronauts, 
Stay with us in our dreams.").  
The only thing that would have made the show complete for 
me is if the Mekons had played my all time favorite song: 
"Only You and Your Ghost Would Know."  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Probably the best part of the show was Sally and Jon's 
banter between songs, which started by Sally announcing that 
Jon would turn 50 years old "at midnight tonight" and making 
wisecracks about his age and not being able to "get it up" anymore.  
Jon replied that he was going to launch his sputnik, 
"that will really scare the Americans," a dual meaning to 
the 50 year anniversary of the Russian spacecraft.  
Jon also warned the audience to stay away from chicken 
pot pies, that "they've been broadcasting it on CNN all day."  
Jon also did a cartwheel on stage, and Sally said with concern, 
"I think you should do that no more than once."  
At the close of the show, the Mekons invited everyone 
over to the Tractor tavern for celebrating Jon's birthday, 
but being a family man I had to get home (and in one piece).  
Back the at the merchandise table I thanked the Mekons for coming back to Seattle.

<i>((Thanks much, Eric, it reminds me of all the many Mekons concerts
I've been to.
They really are more of a "band of the people" than about any 
other band I know of.
My fiftieth birthday, of course, was on Sept. 29th.
And I've long known that I'm exactly two weeks older than Jon Langford,
his birthday really is October 12th, 1957 (Tom Greenhalgh and Susie
Honeyman are a bit older and Sally Timms is a bit younger).
He's always been my favorite band member, he really is a painter
these days, recall that he and Tom first met when they were in
art school together..... like how the Talking Heads met here in
Providence at the Rhode Island School of Design.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((In recent years, they've not been playing the really old songs,
like the <b>Fear and Whiskey</b> songs so much, and they love to
play "Millionaire" and "Ghosts of American Astronauts" in 
concert for some reason, I'm not entirely sure why.
Thanks for a great review, and made me drag out all my old 
Mekons songs and listen.
I just got a USB Turntable for Christmas from my stepson, so
I can put lots of my old vinyl onto music CDs for the highway.
The Mekons and Jonathan Richman are my two favorite "traveling
artists."))</i>

(BERLINER ZEITUNG): Kaiser Marc announced the newest social rehabilitation 
plan for the errant Bavarians. 
"We're going to send some good Prussians south to sober you up and get 
rid of the Italian wino's," stated the Kaiser.
"If we can't beat the olive eating, chianti swilling Italians, with some 
stout Prussians, the world is indeed a sad place."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to ENGLAND): Schedules shift, schedules change, but orders live on forever.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to FRANCE): Rumor has it that a certain Italian is casting 
dispersions upon Bordeaux, saying that French wine is swill and that 
only Italians can make a decent red. Surely you can't stand for that!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA): Good pickens down south...nice weather too. 
It's cold and stormy up north, you don't want to visit...do you???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I want Manny and Coco back...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to AUSTRIA): The mother tongue makes for good neighbors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to TURKEY): Keep in touch!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to ITALY): In the words of Rodney King, 
"Can't we all just get along?"? In the words of the LA Cops, 
"I guess not....THWACK!!!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GERMANY): Thwack, indeed!
And that brings us back to....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 3 –- THE DIRT, THE SKIRT AND THE BEER):
So much for McGillicutty's.  
I had to hit the streets, dig up the dirt.  
I needed mullah, mad skrilla, money to pay for the 
broads and the beers and the cigars...oh yeah, and the rent.  
The Hobby's a dirty place, always someone doing someone in.  
A very dirty place, and I just needed a little dirt.  
Just a little, and I knew exactly where I could get it.
I headed downstairs and out the front door of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>; 
cool air drafted out of McGillicutty's bringing with it the 
tones of Bruno's humming to himself and the odor of stale 
cigarettes and warm beer...or was that warm cigarettes and stale beer?  
Either way, it was tempting, but I was on a mission, it would have to wait. 
I hung a left past <i>Houdini Blues</i> and headed downtown, 
past the boarded up <i>Sprouts of Wrath</i>, past <i>Cheesecake</i>, 
<i>The Boob Report, Magus, Coat of Arms, Perelandra</i>.  
I hung a right at <i>Fiat Bellum</i>, passed <i>Graustark, Flick of the Wrist</i> 
and <i>Europa Express</i>. 
I could no longer tell if I was in the good part of town, or the bad.  
Not that you could tell, the Hobby is painted in a Technicolor 
of sepia and grayscale, the sorta place you could have a 
Harlem sunset anywhere you were.
It wasn't long before I heard the music.  
I heard the music before I saw the lights, 
and I saw the lights from three szines away.  
Club Copasetic, the hottest club in the Hobby, and it showed, 
the place was buzzing.  There were broads and dames galore, 
attracted to the glitz by the money.  
And there was the money: high rollers and hardspenders, 
top-hats and pennypackers, attracted to the glitz by the broads.  
God, what a racket, it just had to make you smile.  
It was one of those John Wayne moments when you wanted to 
thank God for pussy and capitalism and the Great American Way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The place was so busy that the bouncer, well here it's a doorman...
hoity toity, like I said, didn't have time to do a good job frisking me.  
Like a blind man on a first date he didn't know where to 
put his hands and I got in with my rod...both of 'em. 
"Move along. Don' be lettin' out the bought air," he muttered.  
Yeah, this place was class.  I walked in and had to pause, 
let my eyes adjust to the lighting.  
Apparently I had gotten there just as the headliner started to sing...
timing, it's all about the timing...and it didn't hurt that 
I was writing this bit either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Barry had just taken the stage and lit into his trademark song: 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 His name was WeedFred, he thought he was dead

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 With orders flying through the air, and fleets afloatin' here to there

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 He would meringue and do the cha-cha

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Sidestep a frontal attack and support his own assault

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 And while he tried to save his life, the Russian sharpened up a knife.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Across a crowded board, they worked toward Fall oh-four

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 They had hate and they had each other

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Who could ask for more?

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

 His name was David, he was a diamond 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Began with Austria as his lair, moving southward down from there

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 And when he finished - when it was over -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 He would have Turkey to himself like a trophy on a shelf.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 But David went too far, he provoked the Czar

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Then the punches flew and armies were split in two

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 There was blood and a sudden move

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 But just who stabbed who?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 At the Copa, Copasetic

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Always calm, never frenetic...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 At the Copa, Copasetic

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Worries and problems were never the fashion

<div class="p"><!----></div>
	 His name was WeedFred and now he is dead

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 But that was thirty moves ago, when they used...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rest blended into the background noise as I headed past 
the orchestra for the back of the room.  
I passed by the cigarette girl walking the aisles, 
smacking her gum and sashaying her pins like she had the only one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Cigars, cigarettes...say, honey, ya wanna try some Red Kings?  They's on special."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I picked up a pack from the box she had hiked on her hip, "They any good?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Her hand paused on mine for those seconds needed for our eyes to lock, 
you could almost hear the click, "If they's were good, 
they wouldn't be on special."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I gave her the half smile with just the end of one lip curling up 
and looked back deep into her ice blue peepers.  "What makes 'em so special?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Her other hand came up to her neck, the glossy red nails 
just barely tracing the smooth alabaster skin, and she leaned forward 
to huskily whisper, "I hear they've got their own Turkish 
tobacco to make 'em with.  
They gets it so cheap cause they don’t have to pay for it."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Do the Turks know about this?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She gave me a 150 watt smile, you know like the one you 
get when the bulb is new. I almost needed to pull down my fedora.  
"If they don't know already, they will when they read this."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I scratched the scruff on my chin, "Cheap, huh?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah," she breathed and I smelled honeysuckle, "and I know cheap." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"A woman after my own heart..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Oh, it wasn't your heart I was after."   
Yeah, it didn't hurt that I was writing this bit either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I looked over at the next page and saw the guy I needed to talk to, I had to cut this short.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Look babe, I gotta blow.  Meet me at my place in an hour,"  
I slipped her a fin and took a pack of Red Kings, 
"it's in <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>, the walkup above 
Macgillicutty's...not the third floor, that's the games section."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I like games," she said, pouting her red glossy lips. 
They reflected the house lights like the brake lights 
of a delivery truck on rain slicked streets at night.  
Like a Tuesday night, when it wasn't really heavy traffic, 
just the light sort of traffic that made you feel alone in a large Hobby.  
The soft patter of the rain, the dampness of the air 
itself muffling the noise and the light...
the long off sound of a horn blowing in off the harbor, 
or maybe the crackling snap of a radio, heard through an open window 
above your head, being tuned past stations that could only be heard at night...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Errr, errr, er," she cleared her throat, "I said, I like games..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Oh, yeah,"  I was back, "not these sorts of games you wouldn't."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She smiled, "see you in an hour."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Great, hey, pick up a bottle of Cheater's on the way, wouldja doll?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Sure," she grinned, "a lot can happen with a full bottle of whiskey."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was liking this kitten more and more.  
I invested a couple of seconds on her gams as she walked away, 
I could practically feel myself falling for her. 
Back to business. The fall was over.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There was the guy I needed to see, someone who kept his thumb on the 
pulse of the Hobby, especially when that pulse was in your neck.  
I needed dirt, and this was the guy who had it, or knew where to get it...
or knew who was napping under it. 
He sat in his regular booth; the light bulb had been unscrewed so 
that he was in deep shadow. 
As I walked toward him a big palooka on a stool stood up in front of me, 
but a wave of a hand from the booth sat him back down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Nice, ya got him housebroken too?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There was a lessening of the darkness that I took for a smile, 
"I thought you might show up."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Flat, we gotta talk..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MALICE IN CENTERLAND - PART FOUR:  FALLING DOWN):
Straight down the hole Malice fell in the darkness.  
As his eyes adjusted, however, he realized he could 
see the sides of the hole as well as the pulsing red lights 
of the Mutant Butler's eyes below him.  
They were falling through space.  
The concepts of `sides' and `below' soon lost meaning 
though as Malice and the Mutant Butler continued to fall and fall and fall.  
And fall.  
(Keep falling.  Really.)  
Either the hole was very deep or he fell very slowly, 
but he fell for some great time and eventually lost sense of how 
far he'd dropped and who he might be.  
After a time, he noted various maps stuck to the sides of the hole 
and, some time later still, he saw shelves with stacks of 
piled papers covered with strange names like <i>Cheesecake, 
The Boob Report, Magus, Coat of Arms, Hare of the Dog, 
Kathy's Korner, Fiat Bellum, Whitestonia, NorthSealthWestGeorge, 
Off-the-Shelf, Ter-Ran, Graustark, Flick of the Wrist, 
Bersaglieri, Perelandra, Mos Eisley Spacesport, Whiteflame, 
Ishkibibble, Europa Express</i> and many, many more besides.  
Eventually, Malice's simple-yet-mediocre mind began to 
wander and he found himself tunelessly mumbling a timeworn ditty of unknown origin:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "Just sit right there and you'll hear a tale

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 A tale of an endless drop

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 That started when I jumped into

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The North Atlantic Dot.'

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 `This Butler is a curious guide

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 His coat and eyes quite red

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 I sure hope that he knows this hole

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Or when he hit we're dead!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 (Unless we hit a bed...)"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Abruptly, Malice stopped mumbling as new words flowed into his 
thoughts from a source within him that he neither recognized nor understood.  
Moments later, though, he found himself mumbling again 
another odd verse as tunelessly as before:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 "This quest for the Diplonomicon

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Is not for me alone

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Six other souls will quest with me

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 To join the board and stones -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Join the board and stones!'

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 `Sure, Centerland will get quite rough -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Through chaos we'll be tossed

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 If not for the courage of the Hero-Fool

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The Dipcon will be lost

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 And ancient myth exhaust!'

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 `The tale's about to start with this

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Unartful story line -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 With Hero-Fool, The Red King, too

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Kings Yellow, Green, and White,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 A King Dark Blue

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The Black King and all Centerland -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Here's to ma-li-cious guile!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Malice finished the tune and, pleased with himself, 
was about to launch into a second little number, this one from the 
Nickelodeon cartoon hit Spongebob Squarepants, 
when his fall was abruptly terminated by the sudden 
arrival of an unyielding floor-like substance.  
KERSHPLAT!!! went the unyielding floor-like substance as Malice landed on it.  
"OOOOF!!!" went Malice as he slammed heavily into the huge stack of 
musty old szines at the bottom of the hole.  The fall was over.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 4 - A SHOT IN THE DARK): "Flat, we gotta talk..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So there I was, in the Copasetic, sitting across from Flat Evil, 
the button on the belly of the dark underside of the Hobby.  
What little light was left in the already darkened booth seemed to 
suck into his persona.  
Sinking into the deep upholstery of the booth quelled the surrounding noise; 
the orchestra springing into a Henry Mancini number just became 
so much background music...muzak for mobsters.   
A big palooka, Flat's erstwhile bodyguard, sat vigilantly on his barstool 
across the aisle, sipping vigilantly at his beer, and keeping one vigilant eye on me.  
The guy oozed vigilance...I assume that ranks high on attributes for a button man.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The fingers that had killed a thousand people, or at least pointed out 
to underlings which ones to kill, pushed an empty shot glass toward me.   
In the middle of the table was a bottle of the high dollar stuff, 
Hardsloggin, aged 20 years. Real years, not game years, I told you...the good stuff.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Stoke up," said Flat in that dead voice. 
A voice where echoes went to die.
I picked up the bottle, popped the cork.  
Instant aroma; it played well against the backdrop of smoke, 
good food, and the palooka's bad aftershave.  
I poured a generous dose into the shot glass, hell, it'd been hours 
since my last drink... at least one, and Hardsloggin was the good stuff.  
I settled in to take my shot in the dark.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I drank it down, and poured another. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Didn't know you could do single malt in a bath-tub," I said to Flat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse were always the cute one," he muttered back.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, but mom always liked you best."  
I'm known for my razor like repartee. Had to keep up appearances. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I was born an orphan," replied Flat and puffed on his cigar.  
Yeah, he was born an orphan the way the guy was that killed both his parents 
and threw himself on the mercy of the court because he was all alone in the world.	

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse gonna keep crackin' wise, or we gonna talk?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Jim Bob doesn't charge for dialog."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Even at dat rate, youse cheatin' him."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Good one," I smiled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I keeps my hand in."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I decided to play him, which is probably as dangerous as it sounds, 
but I'm not known for the blinding wattage of my intellect. 
I'm kinda of a gut instinct, fly by the seat of my pants, 
get my favorite face beat in kind of guy. 
A Chertoff meets Rockford kinda guy. 
Besides, I could tell he already knew something.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You said you were expecting me."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Someone takes a shit," says Flat, "you expect the smell to show up."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"How eloquent.  So who took the shit?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wrong answer.  One of Flat's eyes narrowed and he leaned 
forward in the booth to better fillet me with the squint.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse here about the missing Hierophant...right?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I didn't even know the Hobby had a zoo.  If an elephant's missing, 
you'd think he’d be pretty easy to find…being big and all.  
I'd look for a lot of grey, should stand out in a black and white world.  
Since when do I take a lost dog case?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Flat chuckled and eased back in the booth.  
The palooka, who had half gotten up, settled back on his stool.  
Like I said, vigilant.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Youse kill me.  Always crackin' wise."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I gave a mental sigh of relief.  I'd gotten away with it.  
I had no idea what he was talking about, "I'm known for my razor like repartee." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, I read that somewheres a few lines back."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So let's say that I was looking for the Hero-phant."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Flat nodded, "youse and a buncha udders."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Otters?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Don' push it."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Who else is looking?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Let's say...interested parties."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Why is everyone so...interested?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It ain't so much the Hierophant, he could be a yutz for all I care...
it's what he's after.  Real Lost Ark stuff."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So he's like the Clockmaker in the Matrix?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Flat grimaced, and pointed the blazing end of his cigar at me. 
"Dat is so cross genre!  Youse sposed to be a flat foot, not a nerd.  
Ya keep breakin' character and we'll get the Continuity Fuzz raiding dis place."   
The palooka looked nervously around at that remark, nervous about the cops. 
But still vigilant.
"I don need to buy more grief than I got already."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So you're one of the interested parties."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Flat shrugged, "I got some stacks o' pennies that could be upset 
by a, howdayasay...unfavorable outcome. But, who don't?  
Dis is a big deal, big as da Hobby."	

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So, if the elephant's not the big deal.  What is?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Dat Diplonomicon thingy."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was leaving the Copasetic more confused than when I got there.  
Apparently there was a missing elephant, being chased by otters, 
because what he was after was very important.  
Important enough that the kingpin of the Hobby underworld was interested, 
if not a little worried.  
It almost sounded like an elephant joke, except for the Flat Evil part...
and I didn't know the punchline.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I hate it when I don't know the punchline.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had faked my way through the meeting with Flat, he thought I was on to something.  
He thought I had a lead, and if I found out something, or someone, for him, 
he would be very grateful.  
Grateful in a couple of bucks sort of way and a 
Get Out of Scrape Without Broken Ribs card the next time 
we crossed paths in a less genial circumstance.  
It wouldn't hurt to have Flat owe me a favor.
I stood there at the front door of the Copasetic on my way out.  
Let my eyes adjust to the outside light as I shook a Red King out of the pack, 
and watched the doorman continue with his frisking of the ingoing patrons.  
I may not be the smartest flatfoot in the Hobby, but...nope, that was all I had.  
I wasn't the smartest flatfoot in the Hobby.  
Elephants, otters...I turned to the doorman.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hey, does the Hobby have a zoo?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He stopped frisking, apparently multi-tasking wasn't a required skill.  
I could see the squint, almost hear the cogs rotate in his huge noggin.  
Seconds ticked by.  "Nah, no zoo."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Of course not, couldn't be that easy."   So much for a shot in the dark.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE BRILLIANT PRESS WRITERS): I tried to perform what I thought was the 
intent of each writer. 
Many may recall (go back in the archives if you like) that both the Red Kings and
Malice in Centerland have previous incarnations in the press.
I didn't print any press in the last two issues, so I just want to remind 
people of this.
The current printing exhausts the list of "Malice in Centerland''s that I have
in hand; while I do have more "Red Kings''s to print.
I was following what I understood to be the intent of the writers.
If I failed, well, why do you think they call me "Boob"?
If I succeeded, well, write more!!!
You can't cheat me!!!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, 
Eric Ozog is continuing to
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The GIRF draw proposal is rejected and reproposed.
Please vote with your Winter orders, if you fail to vote, it cannot pass.
We also have a number of other proposals to vote on with your Winter orders.
As with all proposals, failure to vote vetoes the proposal and they must be 
unanimous.
So, we have I) GIRF draw, II) GT draw, III) FAIRT draw, IV) Recalling 
Terry Tallman to play Germany.
On the last one, I don't have a note from Terry volunteering to return,
but since any one vote, or failure to vote, will veto the proposal, I will
presume that at least one person will check with Terry before voting yes
for this.
If everyone (including Eric, obviously) votes to have Eric leave and
Terry doesn't want to take back over, I will find another standby.
I don't see how that will happen, but thought I should be explicit and 
complete. 
Again, votes are due with the Winter orders.

(STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION PRESS - ABOARD THE SCOUTSHIP `ODYSSEUS' - 
SHIP'S LOG ENTRY): Current Situation Report - a Borg Entity has been
detected with flank Ferengi and Klingon forces. Sensors indicate a
vestigal Breen presence (likely being assimilated). Our extreme range
sensors report a (vile) Klingon war bird attack on a Romulan trader.
Cardassian spaceship wreakage is also being encountered over a large
area of this quadrant. Furthermore, communications emanating from the
Vulcan home worlds sector report a (slimy) Ferengi sneak attack on
Vulcan, itself. Our only recourse is to power up the experimental Vulcan
designed deep space sensors. We might be able to analyze and break the
Borg signal codes thereby freeing the (misguided) Ferengi and Klingons
from further enslavement. Standby for emergency transmissions. Out.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I have been trying to get Karl to submit orders for a while now.
So, I can't hold up this issue any more, so we go with the NMR.
I'm calling Doug Kent as a standby, but hope Karl returns.
Karl needs to get me draft Spring orders by the Winter deadline
to keep the position.  
Other players may make their Winter adjustments conditional on
who gets the position, which will be announced with Winter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF O'DONNELL, THE REF SPEAKS): I have an idea on how to solve the N.B.A's 
problem with gambling and referees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1. Do not give the ref's a long term schedule so the gamblers can't know 
where the ref's are going to be in advance. All the ref's need to know is 
that they will be somewhere. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2. Hire six ref's for each game and have each one prepare to work with pay.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3. Do not let ANYONE know which three of the six will be officiating  
the game until tip off.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4. Have the selection of which three ref's will work the game done by the 
same lottery machine that the N.B.A. uses to determine the draft. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5.Do not let the refs use the phone, any phone at halftime. They basically
need to be sequestered.  With this system there would be no way the 
gamblers would know which ref to approach. It would also ensure that 
the officials are rested and will create a competitive spirit among 
the ref's as they sit on the bench and watch there counter parts work. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
p.s. I used to be a high school j.v. basketball ref before I started having 
physical problems.  it was always funny to me to watch how SOME of 
my fellow refs at the varsity,college and pro level can be so arrogant 
and often made the same type of mistakes that myself and my fellow j.v. 
refs would occasionaly make. like federal judges elected for life 
the apsolute authority that a ref gets even though it's only for 
a couple of hours causes some of them to cop an attitude.  
I think that was the mentality of the guy who threw out Tim Duncan.  
I don't see any real difference between the quality of refs from the 
college to the pro level. 
Adding another 76 refs would not lower the quality of the refs and I
think it would improve with the competition.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I didn't have orders from many of you, and didn't want to hold up this
already egregiously late issue for this game, so for those of you I didn't
have orders from, everyone played lowest card.
In the end, of course, ALMOST everyone played lowest card, just almost enough 
to break up the middle of the pack - note the slick move by Wally...
