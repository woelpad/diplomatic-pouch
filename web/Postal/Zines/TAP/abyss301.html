I gotta get this issue out (at least finalized and printed) before the NCAA games
start so that I can get my picks out there for y'all to laugh at.
I hope some of you got Jamie McQuinn's message and joined Jamie's NCAA pick group.
We'll let you all know next issue what happened there.
Next deadline is April Fool's Day, really!
Send me your orders properly, but anything else fun you want to send in honor of 
that day will be accepted.
Anyone up to faking me?
Go for that too if you like.
Best news of all is that Doug Kent is back in Dallas, well, almost, he's
in a halfway house in Hutchins but he's using his Dallas E-Mail and address
again.  He warns me that he only will get to see things once a week or so,
so take that into consideration as you negotiate with him in games.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lots of fallout from last issue, I wish I had gotten a subszine from Michael Lowrey
in time for the issue, but we'll definitely have him in the next two issues, as
he's already sent me TWO subszines.
David Partridge has a "correction" in this issue.
And lots of feedback on the pictures including the note below from Eric Ozog.... I 
THOUGHT that wasn't him, though I know I recognize the picture.
But I can't place it!
Can anyone help Doug Beyerlein out and identify who that REALLY is in last issue's
picture montage???
Extra special bonus prizes from me to whoever gets it.
Included is a bonus blown up Eric and Cathy photo in this issue for selected 
subbers (I can't afford to do everyone), and then I put a picture that Conrad
von Metzke sent me (see his letter below that) on that same insert.
If you were not lucky enough to receive the insert and want to see it,
I've put it up on the web page with this issue.
I remember when Eric and Cathy were just getting together and many of us were matchmaking
trying to put them together, but of course they already really were pretty much
together and they had to just politely go along with our nattering interference....
or something like that, anyway, here's what Eric had to say to me:

Hi Jim,
I received TAP #300 the other day - congratulations on your staying power!
 Including Doug Beyerlein's early dip hobby photos was a neat idea, and
I'd like to see more of that; I'm sure a lot of folks have photos of dip
personalities they could share.  But alas- Doug's 1984 photo of an
alleged "Eric Ozog" is not accurate!  The face looks familiar, but I can
attest that person is not me. Not elflike at all; hair is too hobbit
curly and dark brown, while mine is straight and sandy blond (albeit less
of it now).  I do recall for a brief time in 1982 I got bored with my
straight hair and had my mom curl it that year; so people may have seen
me with curly locks at DipCon in Baltimore.  I drove to that Dipcon with
Dan Stafford, Randy Ellis, and Stuart Lancaster in my green 1978 Mercury
Cougar (which I still drive today).  I also wore a contact lens at the
time- no glasses.  I don't believe I attended a major dip-convention in
1984, except perhaps a Madcon or Pudgecon in that year. Cathy Cunning and
I met for the first time to go to the 1983 Dipcon in Detroit, where I
believe I won second place and best France in the tournament; more
importantly, Cathy and I solidified our "love alliance."  I was 23 in
1984, the year Cathy moved from Phoenix to live with me in Chicago.
Attached is a 1984 photo of the two of us.  This may sound corny, but you
can see the youthful glow of love in the faces.  We married in 1985, and
we're still allied after nearly 21 years. I believe the postal diplomacy
hobby reached its zenith during the early '80s- it was so full of life.
Those were happy times.  People had a great time getting together to play
the Grand Old Game in person and enjoyed each others' company, and
driving and flying long distances to do so wasn't a burden; rather, it
was part of the fun (maybe my perception of "The Hobby" during this time
was a bit skewed from falling in love).  Today, I'm happy to say, there
is an active face-to-face hobby in the Pacific Northwest: Seattle,
Portland, and Vancouver, B.C., with a new generation of hard-core players
who organize tournaments on a regular basis. Once or twice a year I try
to make a Northwest con.  I don't play very well compared to 20 years ago
(I got my butt kicked at Dipcon in Portland), but I still enjoy the game;
the cheap thrill of playing face-to-face is still in my blood.

Hi, Jim, my fault, you keep sending, I keep reading, but I never let out a
peep, do I?  Well, now's the time.  300 issues (however you choose to
compute the number makes no difference, quite a few of your issues have been
big enough to justify five numbers each) is monumental, particularly now
when there is so little postal publishing left.  And so I toast you, with
great admiration and a dash of jealousy here and there, that you made it and
I, er, well, didn't.  (Officially <i>COSTA</i> closed at 299.  I think;
29something, anyway.  I did carry on thereafter in a sense; one gunboat game
was still going, and I finished it up by e-mail until it finally ended (in
game year 1934, won by Eric Brosius).  But at one time, after one of my many
re-starts after a lapse, Walt Buchanan challenged my numbering system and
indicated that, in his opinion, I was running numbers that were half a dozen
too high.  I have no idea.  Nor do I care any longer.)  No matter what the
details, you did it, I didn't, and I couldn't be prouder.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Which is as good a time as any to say thanks for all the issues, which I
honestly don't deserve, but which I do read and will not refuse to
accept....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course I looked at the photos - I barely remember me!  It was pleasant to
know that I clearly remember every single one of the names shown, and also
the faces of those I met at one time or another (roughly half).  I've also
read some of the big fat issue so far, and will do the rest tonight; it will
not go to waste, believe me!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One last thing for the moment - to update you on personal appearances, I
attach - no, I will put into a separate message owing to the download time -
a more or less current photo.  Taken last July, on board a cruise ship in
Alaska.  L-R rear, Ross, Conrad and Eric; front, Sara Spafford (Eric's
fiancee) and Jean.  Second photo, of the other member of the family, who
couldn't come on the ship:  Xena, Warrior Rhodesian Ridgeback.
<i>((I only included the first picture.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(In the group photo, of perhaps a bit of interest; the photos on the wall
behind us:  The smaller one is Scott Carpenter, the astronaut; the larger
one is his wife, Patricia, who christened the ship "Mercury" in honor of
husband's space mission.  And no, the plant on the right is not a Christmas
tree, though I'll bet in December it is trimmed to double as one!)
<i>((And because of the way it is cropped, you only can see Patricia 
Carpenter really well, but squint at the other one, or go look at the version
on the web page and blow it up....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh - okay, one more last thing:  I'm long gone from Diplomacy now, but am
still active in other postal gaming (railroad games); I do a subzine for
David Oya in Banbury, UK. (<i>CALAFIA'S ISLAND</i>); I run one game as a `guest' in
Jim Reader's <i>VARIABLE PIG</i>; and I have several games of my own going on by
e-mail in a sort of unofficial e-szine (to borrow your preferred usage)
which used to be called <i>DISORIENTED EXPRESS</i> but then went dormant for a
couple of years, and now it's back I can't decide what to name it, if
anything, so it just goes on without any designation.  But it does go on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The end.  Really.

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.

He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date was now a "whenever".
But Peter is now clearly back and appears in most issues!!!
Wish Peter well as he has been through a bit of a rough time lately.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JEFF KEY</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been planning to put Jeff Key up here many times in the past, but
someone else always made it to the list.
Since we have the aborted John Beshara search, this is the time to find Jeff.
I met Jeff that I remember just once, I think it was at Paul Gardner's house
and one of those wild spread out cons that he used to have at his house in
Vermont.  But I've not heard from Jeff now in many, many years.
So let's go find him!
As always it is worth fifty bucks if you locate him and get him to write to me.
Jeff, of course, is most famous for devising and naming the Key Lepanto 
game opening alliance between Austria and Italy against Turkey.
For some reason, I've been seeing LOTS of Key Lepantos or aborted 
Key Lepantos lately.  It's about time that we find Jeff and see what he's
been up to.
<i>((If anyone knows where Paul Gardner is, that would be good too....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

for details on progress on the WORLDMASTERS04, the Round 2 games are 
close to finished and the semifinalists are about set.  As I look at it,
semifinals notables include: Egg Ferreira, Buffalo Bartalone, Lee Simpson, 
Joe Janbu, Sebastian Beer,
Jerry Fest, Twerg O'Donnchu, Tim Sweeney, Dave Partridge, Glenn Ledder,
Adam Silverman, Toby Harris, and Thomas Franke.
This is one of the deepest semifinal fields for this great tournament 
that I've seen, with representatives from nearly all of the world's
hobby communities.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And remember I got called in as a STANDBY for Turkey in game WM04R221!!!
This game did end with center counts Andy Bartalone with 15, Glenn Ledder with 12, 
me with 6, and Dan in Austria with just Greece.
In another world I could have challenged Glenn and Andy more, I wish them 
both luck as they move on to the semis.  
In particular, I don't know how Andy will fare if he continues to be as busy
in his new job as he was during this game.
He just didn't pay enough attention.  
In another world, his clock would have been cleaned.

However, this forum has been very, very quiet, I hope it picks up with
semis, maybe I'll have to start some discussion.
But most of the talk that there has been has about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson

This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really

<br /><br /><b>Jim O'Kelley (Mon, 27 Feb 2006 17:51:38 -0600)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hey, Guys.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
DipCon was a lot of fun, as usual.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After a brutal first round in which I was on a board that coughed up a solo,
and a mediocre second round in which I managed to weasel my five-center
England into a four-way draw, I rallied. In the third round Saturday night,
I got a nine-center three-way as France. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My best round came Sunday morning in round four. That was the timed round. I
played Turkey on a board that featured Andy Bartalone in Austria, Jake
Mannix in Italy, and Edi Birsan in Russia. I killed Edi with Austria and
Germany, then stabbed Austria. With Italy's help, I killed off Bartalone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then, due to miscommunication with my Italian ally, I found myself in the
Ionian with an open Naples staring me in the face. I already had 11 centers,
so, as I'm wont to do (Don will attest...), I three-dotted him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didn't have much of a shot at a solo, but I hoped to cut Italy out of the
draw. Sadly, Jake talked his way into the stalemate line, and the game ended
in a four-way draw as time expired with me at 16 centers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A three-way would have given me Best Turkey, but the 16-center four-way was
good enough to vault me onto the top board. I finished seventh and have a
nice plaque to prove it. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Don, Hohn Cho won the tournament, and Steve Cooley finished second. Edi
placed fourth, so the California crowd fared pretty well. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Any chance of getting some of you guys to Dixie Con this year? It's a long
shot for me, but I'm going to work on it.

Hi Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hope all is well at your end.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So you'd like more reading material in Dip Zines huh? Okey dokey. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Your Worldmasters Update may be a little out-dated; I'm sure you can
glean the top 49 going through to the semis for next issue. Most games
are either finished or near the end now. As this is (as far as I know)
the world's biggest email tournament it's surely worth a few words.

as well.
I think what I'm not printing will go in <b>Diplomacy World</b>.))</i>

And other news is that the European Championships for 2006 took place
last weekend. My write-up follows.

Greetings one and all. I hope you all had a great time this year. It was
certainly great to see you all again.
So, a little round-up on the EDC;

The Venue</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The surroundings were unusual but comfortable for most; some players
were not overly happy with the low tables around the edge of the room,
but these were designed so that the likes of Ronald Lokers wouldn't bump
his head on the lower part of the ceiling. Needless to say, Vic &amp; Demis
had no such misfortune.
In general, the dorms and playing area were described as comfortable and
the refreshments reasonably priced.

Mindscape / Paradox very kindly paid the balance on the room hire and
donated three Diplomacy games for the winners, which was very much
appreciated. I hope that the material around the room (place cards and
posters) were noted and that some or all of you will now go and buy the
game and tell your friends what you think of it. It does play well in so
much that you can diplome with your neighbours etc (this hasn't been
achieved before in a computer game) and if you play it for this reason
you'll enjoy it. The AI is not as strong as an experienced player (I
think this is a tough nut to crack) but I have certainly enjoyed playing
a few rounds and would say it's worth trying out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The bid for EDC 2007 in Marseilles (hosted by Gwen Maggi &amp; Cyrille
Sevin) beat off all rivals and so we'll be playing on the beach,
surrounded by bronzed Mediterranean sunbathers. It almost makes missing
the final round sound like a good idea.
Hopefully Gwen will lead the way and we'll all jump into the sea for a
little splash.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WDC 2006 will be in Berlin during the first weekend of August, and this
is a real must for all Diplomacy players with a lust for increasing
their silverware collection.

The "Team" Round</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The whole purpose of what we did this year was to make 100% certain that
three of the awards went home to three different countries, and so we
had a nationality tournament with all players secretly representing
their home country. Needless to say the last thing I wanted was a repeat
of WDC 2004 so the event was announced after it had taken place, with
all players scores summed (and divided by "n+1") for the country they
represented. This gave us three `National Heroes' for the players
representing the top three countries.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For Germany we have Bogislaw "Joe 90" Schoenf;
For France Guillaume Marliot;
And for the UK Simon Bouton.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Needless to say, our Scottish visitor John Jamieson was a most welcome
addition to the Dutch team ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
The Scoring System</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ah yes, that element of a DipCon which always gets moaned about! I
wanted a system which did two things:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1.    Simple to add up

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2.    A system which HURTS players who come second

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So how do we achieve this?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
a.    Use simple numbers (1's and 10's)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
b.    REWARD players for EVERYTHING (survival, topping the board etc)
EXCEPT those who come second!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Subtle, huh? Indeed, players could see the value of survival; as TD I
kept a few players in the game in my first round - so please don't think
that a 13-centre Turkey is where it would have ended had I played
"normally" ;-). The real irony of all this is that it took a while for
the penny to drop - elimination in 1908 wasn't worth so much less than a
one centre survival!
And of course the table-toppers get a bonus. Not a "silly" bonus - it's
crazy to lose 24 C-Diplo points just because of a final turn misorder or
unpleasant "gift" to another player. But hey, every system is different
and this one was designed to give a little something for every style of
play - except perhaps my own style of preferring a "centres squared"
system which rewards the players who really push for the 18 every time
they play. 
Whatever - the tournament was not let down by the scoring system and
most who commented on it liked its raw subtleties.

The Top Table</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was an interesting one, generating lots of feedback and comments,
so I'd like to set the record straight on a few things. The first point
of note is that there were four French and three English players, and
the alliances did tend towards "French vs English". However this is
little more than coincidence because the alliances tended to swing
according to personal opportunity and individual desire to do well in
the game, rather than any international conflict. And that's how it
should be. I watched the game unfold and adjudicated every turn - and
all seven players did their best to win. But for a breakdown of my
personal view on each performance;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Austria (Vic Hall)
Vic started by covering Trieste and sending his fleet south, letting
Russia (Simon Bouton) into Galicia. It looked bad until Simon supported
Gal-Rum in the fall. From this point until the mid game it appeared Vic
played the perfect game; covering Albania at the right moments (I've
always maintained the value of Albania when playing Austria) and keeping
Turkey bottled up at home. Vic's downfall came more through bad luck in
so much that Italy (Guillaume Marliot) could guarantee no worse than
second place in the tournament by ensuring he topped Vic on this final
board. Eventually, with Russia going down to the northern alliance and
Turkey &amp; Italy after some gains towards the end-game, Vic never grew to
7 and by the end was knocked down by the I/T alliance. I don't think
there was anything Vic could have done at any point in the game to
improve his end result and for this reason I felt more disappointed for
him than any other player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
England (Cyrille Sevin)
Cyrille was quick to spot that his best chance in this game was to ally
with Germany (Gwen Maggi) and played it well. By the mid-game France
(Chetan) was contained on five and he &amp; Gwen had gotten through to War,
Stp &amp; Mos.
After Spring 1904 had been adjudicated the opportunity was there for
Cyrille to stab his German ally for the fall and guarantee 1st place.
Russia's northern game was over and France was not in position to stop
England taking virtually everything east of Holland (which he already
owned). However, Germany turned on Cyrille through (what I understand to
be) some powerful persuasion by Chetan, and suddenly the game was alive
once more. Cyrille looked like a probable winner for the next few years
because (in 1904) Turkey was still struggling on three centres.
I felt Cyrille was perhaps a tad soft on his German ally - had he gone
in for the kill maybe the end result would have been different.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
France (Chetan Radia)
It looked quite good for Chetan up to the mid-game; Italy stayed East
and with his units well-positioned Chetan appeared to always have a
threatening position against England. But many turns were wasted -
continuous agreed 1 x 1 bounces over the Channel, later being replaced
with 2 x 2 bounces. Why, I wondered, didn't Chetan go for Bre-MAO,
MAO-NAO and cover Brest with an army whilst convoying to Clyde? It could
have made a difference. But Chetan did save the game in 1904 and
persuaded Gwen to take Holland from Cyrille, which was a superb feat in
itself. Had he not stolen Belgium from Germany the following year, maybe
Gwen would have continued to work with him and this could have given
Chetan the edge. Who knows whether this might have had a better result
for him in the end.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Germany (Gwen Maggi)
Gwen took three builds in 1901 and stood Russia (Simon Bouton) out of
Sweden. The Sweden bounce was probably justified because Simon had
gotten into Galicia and looked strong from the off. But Gwen made some
mistakes in this game - probably more than anyone else in fact. The
worst of these was a fleet move from BAL-Lvn in an attempt to cut
Simon's support for Warsaw (Gwen had moved to Sil &amp; Pru in Spring 1902).
Simon saw this coming and made sure he vacated Livonia, leaving Gwen
with a very badly placed fleet in Livonia. On a top board I think this
was probably the weakest move of the game.
However, Gwen did realize the threat from Cyrille and stabbed him when
it mattered, therefore ensuring it wasn't all over in 1904. Although
Gwen had a high sc count until (and through) the mid game, his nearest
rivals leading into the mid game were A/F/E - which is not a good omen
for the end game supply centre grab!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Italy (Guillaume Marliot)
Guillaume appeared obsessed with taking Vic down from 1902 onwards,
presumably because Vic entered the final game as the only player ahead
of him. There were no attempts throughout the game to attack either F or
T, so this meant Austria would always feel the pressure of his Italian
neighbour. Guillaume spent most of the game on four centres but towards
the final two years his break came and Trieste fell. At one stage it was
clear Guillaume had a very real chance of topping the board - spoilt
only by Vic deciding it wasn't to be and denying his game-long aggressor
the chance to win. Guillaume didn't play 'badly', but he did appear
focused on moving his pieces in just the one direction (i.e., against
Austria). Perhaps had he considered ION-EAS at some point (with a
follow-up convoy to Syria) maybe his game would have ended differently.
The motto here is that if you focus on guaranteeing 2nd place in the
tournament you will lose sight of first place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Russia (Simon Bouton)
Simon started with a successful move to Galicia, making himself look so
strong in the first year that any doubt over Sweden was sealed
immediately. Maybe it was already sealed, but this would have tipped the
balance for me.
Simon did make some great moves in the game - I liked the vacation of
Livonia to welcome the German fleet into a useless province. I was also
impressed with his Diplomacy; England and Germany were both attacking
him and threatened Mos &amp; War between them. When England (Cyrille) asked
for a chat, Simon's response was "is that so you can ensure you get your
centre and your ally doesn't?" I guess you had to be there to find it
funny. Anyways, once the E/G had formed there was little Simon could do.
Despite being assaulted from three sides, Simon did get a build in the
mid-game though and this was where I felt Simon could have played it
better; no home centres available! Better to have foregone the bounce
with Turkey in BLA and moved to Rum or Arm instead - give up on the
north, build another fleet in Sev and go for a southern game. It was
possible he might have eliminated Turkey from this and history would
have been changed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Turkey (Benjamin Pouilles)
Benjamin faced a lot of early game pressure from the A/R alliance,
losing Bulgaria early on and continuously being bounced out of BLA &amp;
AEG. Eventually the break came and Ben slowly grew to top the table on
ten centres. His diplomacy appeared first class (from what I heard) and
his moves solid. He stayed friendly throughout and just got on with it,
waiting for his time to come and seizing the moment. There isn't a lot
you can do to praise a player who plays Turkey - it's a basic &amp; boring
country to play. But everyone knows the dangers of Turkey and if you
don't take it out early, chances are it will come back and bite you on
the arse at the end. And that's just what Ben did. Very well played and
on balance I'd say Ben was the player who made the least mistakes,
stayed the friendliest, kept discussions going and deserved the win. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All in all I'd say it was a good and fair top table with the best guy on
the day winning. Well done Benjamin - a very worthy winner.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ironic that when unpacking the little 7th place trophy I thought of
Demis. He missed out on the top table by one point thanks to a centre he
felt he didn't need in the third round - serves you right Demis; I hope
you'll never do this again! But a Best Country glass plaque and a
`trophette' for 7th will have sugared the pill.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Robin Walters just missed out on the top board too, but a solid fourth
round result won him a couple of prizes to take home. Great stuff. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The top five slots went to players on the final table, supporting the
new scoring system further in that top table players shouldn't
necessarily sacrifice their chance of a trophy by playing on the
tougher, final board. Similarly, virtually every player in the top half
of the scoreboard entering the final round would have made the top three
with an outright win in the final round.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for my not playing in the final round, my role was to GM the final.
But, for the record, had I played and been eliminated in 1907 . that
makes a total of 94. He he, just how `worthy' can you get ;-)
But this aside, when you play Diplomacy with the opening line "don't
worry about me - my scores won't count" it did lead to an unfair
advantage - so the exclusion of my scores was the right thing to do.
What perhaps wasn't right were those lovely allies who believed it, and
won't ally with me again at WDC!!! Bah, what a wasted opportunity -
maybe I should have sought council from Xavier on what to do as TD ;-)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ok, official results from Dave follow and final thanks to both Dave and
Shaun in making all this happen.

Eeeww... colour photos of Larry Peery shaved... I feel all dirty...
Actually, doesn't he look like Stan Wrobel? Maybe they were separated 
at birth...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I enjoyed Larry's Beshara tribute, even though I had never heard of 
Beshara before. . Most interesting coincidences.
I should also say I have a Combustible Edison album, bought after 
seeing the video for their theme to "Four Rooms" on tv in LA in 1994.
I later got the "Four Rooms" video out to watch. It was ok, nothing 
great, but it had a few moments. Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train" was a 
similar concept and heaps better. But the Combustible Edison album is 
great. Is their other stuff in a similar vein, or completely different?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another favourite album is Joe Jackson's "Jumping Jive", which is 
completely different to the rest of his oeuvre. I was so disappointed 
when I bought more Joe Jackson albums....

<i>((Well, Joe is quite eclectic and he gets annoyed by fans on all 
sides who like one or another part of what he's done and wants him to
be more consistent.  
I've been able to follow and enjoy to one extent or another most of what
he's done, but there really are hardly any two albums alike in the oeuvre.
If you like "Jumping Jive", the first one I would recommend is "Body and
Soul" with a lot of Joe on sax and lots of other horns and saxes.
That was 1984, the album before that in 1982 ("Night and Day") was generally
panned for being extremely uneven, it started a push where Joe consciously
tried to mix genres and styles, almost to drag his audience along after him
where he wanted to go.
But "Body and Soul" stayed pretty consistent and is one of his best albums
in my view.
I'm not sure what else you bought, but you probably began to think the guy
was schizophrenic.
And perhaps he is.
All of Combustible Edison's work is in the similar vein. 
I think they have three albums.
The same people made some other records in their "Christmas" incarnation, but
those are decidedly different in character.
As you describe yourself, you wouldn't like them.))</i>

JIM-BOB'S HORRIBLE NCAA TOURNAMENT PICKS</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am actually getting this out the door (typing this last) after the first two rounds of
games.  So, what I'm going to report in each regional is my original picks, some comments,
and then some revised thinking. 
But the summary is still this.
I think Florida can get to the Final Four, beat UConn, and then beat West Virginia or
UCLA or even (ugh) Duke who get to the final to oppose them.
Billy Donovan's Florida Gators to win it all, you might have heard it here first.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Washington Regional: As my big upset here, I was picking Winthrop to knock off Tennessee,
and they ALMOST did it!
But this didn't hurt my bracket very much, because I was sure that the Wichita State
surprise would easily overwhelm Seton Hall and get into the Sweet Sixteen.
I nailed that one!
I had them opposing North Carolina, who I thought would make a run, but NO, another
of those teams, George Mason made it by Michigan State (which I did not have) and by
UNC.
Wow.
It shouldn't matter, as UConn now has an even easier trip to the Final Four than I 
thought they would have, their ALMOST collapses in the first two games nonwithstanding.
As I said above, it will only be Florida in the Final Four that can knock them off.
I thought Calhoun saying that beating Albany in the first round was his hardest
coaching job of his career was laughable except that I think it was true.
I had Illinois opposing UConn in the Sweet Sixteen, which won't happen.
Hands down, UConn has the best talent in the country, NO ONE has players of the
caliber of Anderson, Boone, Gay, and Williams, but that doesn't mean they are
going to play the best.
After the first weekend, Calhoun already is having a heart attack!!!
Imagine what happens next???
Sometime they won't be able to just turn it on.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Minneapolis Regional: Here, my big teams going to the Sweet Sixteen as somewhat
surprising were Nevada (who couldn't even get past Montana) and Wisconsin (who
couldn't even get past Arizona).  The game between Arizona and Villanova to get
into the Sweet Sixteen was a REAL classic!
Wow, what a game..... and I thought that BC had had their run getting to the ACC
Tournament Final.
But Villanova and BC should be a great matchup.  I'm
still predicting that the winner won't matter because Florida is destined for 
the Final Four.
It was only 20 years ago that Billy Donovan made it there as a player with Providence!!!
I nailed the lower half of that bracket (not that it was that hard), but now I think
that Florida prevails easily over Ohio State (which I had) and probably Villanova,
so their trip to the Final Four will be more difficult.
The Gators have the same background as West Virginia, played well early and then coasted
waiting for the tournament, Taurean Green is a GREAT set-up man and those
two forwards Noah and Horford crashing the boards will knock out Villanova's
small team without getting distracted by their quickness.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Atlanta Regional: We all hate Duke, right?  I still couldn't keep Duke out of the
Elite Eight, where I have them falling to West Virginia.  
West Virginia had a bad last couple of weeks, but clearly they were gearing
up to what was really important.... THIS!
I had Iowa and then West Virginia getting past Iowa, and of course their path
was a bit easier than that against Northwestern St.
I had them beating Texas in the Sweet Sixteen, and still have that.
I totally screwed up the upper part of that bracket, except for knowing
that Syracuse was one and done after their great run through the Big East 
Tournament (that was amazing, and really special!!!).
West Virginia is one of the few teams with a serious inside center who also
can go outside in Kevin Pittsnogle.
He is the kind of player, with his experience last year, that gets to the Final
Four.
Yes, the rest of the team doesn't always play good D, but they don't miss Free
Throws and Mike Gansey also is the kind of "do-everything" player that you 
gotta love.
Joe Herber runs the offense with efficiency.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oakland Regional: My big problem here as thinking that four seed Kansas would be 
the team making the run through this Regional.
HOW wrong could I be???
They couldn't even get past Bradley!!!
Bradley is such an easy team to like, why didn't I like them..... damn, I hate
missing the underdogs!
Otherwise, I had this upper part of that bracket OK.
I am rooting for Bradley now to keep going!!!
In the bottom part, I thought that Indiana could beat Gonzaga, but I still
think that UCLA can beat Gonzaga.
If Bradley can't make the Final Four as a REAL underdog, I hope that UCLA
can.
Boy do I HATE Memphis, hate Memphis.....
we grew to hate John Calipari when he was up here in Mass. as a poor man's
Rick Pitino type (and yes, I still love Ricky P.).
But Rodney Carney and Joey Dorsey are just ugly, ugly players.
Yuck.... I wanna watch basketball, not a street fight.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, another good tournament, still one of the best sporting events of the year.
We haven't had any really huge upsets yet, but I think we're about to get some
Top Seeds knocked off.  And while the number two seeds are not impressive, teams
like Florida at number three are. 
And those are JUST the kinds of teams that win this thing if one of the favorites doesn't.
Join me in rooting against Memphis and Duke.....

Our Ferengi allies are holding their own as are our Breen allies.
