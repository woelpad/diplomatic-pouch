<br /><br />Sigh, that said business trip put me WAY behind on getting the printed
version of the szine in all of your hands, as well as putting me behind
in life in general.  So, the szine was again two weeks delayed.  I pushed
all the deadlines back another two weeks to compensate and I did hold
most of the games over, since the postal szine reached many of you after
the deadline.
We've got Rip and Harold as subszines, plus lots more from Doug Kent
and Steve Langley.
Oh, and updates on lots of this year's upcoming FTF cons.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="p"><!----></div>
The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still at least one opening, you can start RIGHT NOW to play next year!
Milwaukee won the World Series, something that can NEVER happen in real life.
It isn't like a regular fantasy league, it's completely unique.
We're just about to start Spring Training now.
I got myself TORCHED in free agency and my team is pretty well decimated
in hitting for average and power.
I'll be lucky if I hit 100 homers and bat .240.
Oh well, tank and wait for next year....
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the

Peter Sullivan's subszine remains "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 unsubscribe tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR STEVE HEINOWSKI</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>LOTS</i> of people have contacted Steve,
but he hasn't contacted ME yet....
You have until issue #280 to find him for the fifty buck prize.
This makes TWO missing ex-Boardman Number Custodians that we're
trying to find.
The key to this is you need to get him to write me a letter (or
send me an E-Mail, contrary to my belief, he might have an
E-Mail address...).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double

I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

We are back, Tim Haffey has agreed to be the Production Editor that I needed.
We already have a pretty decent issue put together, but we always need more articles,
either before the deadline for the next issue, which is March 1, 2004 for Issue #89; 
or afterward for Issue #90 or so on, we're going to try to achieve the quarterly
operation that we haven't been able to do in recent years!
If first impressions are anything, Tim Haffey is going to be an EXCELLENT nudge
to keep things going!
John Coffin and David Hertzman have taken over <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i> as
editors and I look forward to some nice friendly competition.
<i>The Pouch</i> will continue to be primarily a Web Szine, primarily oriented
toward the Judge hobby, preferring submissions in html (or plain text).
<i>Diplomacy World</i> will continue to format itself into more of a "complete
package" that can be printed, allowing submissions in any computer generated
format, or even in text.
We are going to be using a new technology under Tim in something called &#235;book",
we'll hear more about that as we get going, but <i>Diplomacy World</i> I hope
will thrive along with <i>the Pouch</i>.
Help us out, write an article!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I'd be interested in hearing any Hobby Award Nominations for:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The award ballot for this year will be publicized first in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #89,

Diplomacy World is now officially resurrected and continuing with
its four times a year publication schedule as a Web zine 
(www.diplomacyworld.org) and is available as a postal zine: 
cost $3 per issue in North America, <i>$</i>2 per issue in the UK 
and <i>$</i>3 per issue in the rest of the world.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tim Haffey will join Jim Burgess as an editor.  Stephen Agar
will continue to do upkeep on the Web site.  Note all E-Mails
below are in the spam friendly format "person of site.com"
where that translates into person@site.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
North American postal subs should be sent to David Partridge, 
15 Woodland Drive, Brookline, NH 03033, USA.
Email: rebhuhn of rocketmail.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rest of World postal subs should be sent to Stephen Agar, 4 Cedars 
Gardens, Brighton, UNITED KINGDOM  BN1 6YD
Email: stephen of stephenagar.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Contributions for the next issue should be sent to Tim Haffey 
by 1st March 2004: trhaffey of aol.com or Timothy R. Haffey, Sr., 
810 53rd Ave., Oakland, CA 94601 USA. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tim is going to be formatting the issues in the "Industry 
Standard" ebook format (for one example see www.openebook.org) and this is
a major contribution that maintains Diplomacy World as a bridge
between all of the Diplomacy Hobby mediums, since it will be
easily available on the web and by post.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I (Jim Burgess) will continue to co-edit and contribute the popular
Diplomacy World Interviews (I've already interviewed such luminaries
as Richard Sharp, Edi Birsan, and Brandon Clarke).  I am currently
seeking a "quick turnaround" interview candidate for the next issue,
Number 89, who can get me a paragraph Diplomacy bio in the next
week or so.  Please ask me (burgess of world.std.com) if you have
any questions or want to volunteer to be interviewed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also would like volunteers for the next Diplomacy World Demo
Game.  The last demo game (recount, using the Modern Diplomacy
variant) never was properly written up here in DW.  I hope we
can get that in the Pouch Showcase section and a write-up here
in good time.  Rick Desper (previous DW Demo Game GM and recount
GM, rick_desper of yahoo.com), Tim Haffey, and myself will consider
those requests and make a Demo Game determination of GM, location,
and Variant (if any) to be announced in Issue Number 89.  Also,
any of the participants in recount who would like to contribute
to an article or articles on this game, should contact me or Rick.
I have all of your E-Mailed endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Other articles of all types are welcome (we already have four articles
in hand, so we're in good shape for the return issue):  historical
articles, convention write-ups and descriptions, strategy or tactics
articles, personality profiles, descriptions of gaming environments,
or anything else you can think of.  If you aren't sure if it works,
ask one of us.

And last, but not least, I wish John Coffin and David Hertzman
the best of luck as they take on their new challenge of following
up Manus Hand and Edward Hawthorne as editors of The Diplomatic
Pouch.  I fervently believe that having both DW and the Pouch
active and vibrant creates better writing and better things for
all of us in the hobby.  I intentionally waited with this 
announcement until they hit the ground with two weeks running.
But 2004 should be a fun year for the hobby.

The JDPR has been updated, as of January 1, 2004.  Note the new URL:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Alain Tesio's web tools are great for finding out JDPR data:

There's a date for the most recent update on each page - make sure they
match before complaining that the information on the pages isn't the
same.  :-)  If the second web site doesn't have the most up-to-date
information, then use the first (it's just far more cumbersome).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Chris Aanstoos finished the year as the world's #1 ranked Judge Diplomacy
player, joining Dan Shoham and Roger Yonkoski as the only three players
to top the list for two different years.  Chris finished four games in 2003:
three takeover positions that finished as two draws and a win and a
game he started and finished in a three-way draw.  His rating went *down*
as a result, from 2198 to 2129, but no one passed him as a result.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Relative newcomer Steve Bush improved upon his debut ranking, jumping from
seventh to second.  He finished only one game last year, but it was
a full-press solo over solid competition in `henry' on USVG.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anders Dessmark re-emerged on the Judge Diplomacy scene after having not
played since 1998.  Finished two games, soloed in both:  `longtred4' on
USDP and `papa2' on DEDO.  That vaulted him from 1562 to 1831.  Curiously,
his 1562 was good for 12th place in 1998, but his 1831 is good for just
7th today.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hot shot debuts on the list include:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- #17 Ingo Wieck, who has three solos in five starts, plus three solos
and two draws in five replacement positions (mostly playing
Payola and Crystal Ball variants, which slows down his ascent).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- #30 Antonio Benvenuti, who doesn't play that many games and finally
finished number seven.  His results:  three solos and four draws.
The solos built him to a 1623 rating and three draws since have just
let him stay in place - more victories would be required to go
higher.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All these players have done well so far, but their ratings are still
highly volatile and they'll have to continue their strong performance
to stay amongst the top-rated players in the hobby.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
New games amongst the top-rated contests of all-time:  Vermont Group
Full-Press Tournament semi-final games #5 foot, #21 village, #23 point,
and #99 valley.  Other Vermont Group games to break into the top 100
include three "rating class G" games, five first-round VGFP games, six
games from the '03 VG No-Press tournament, and two other random USVG
games.  Also scoring well were `superman' on USDP (#37), and `jena' on
USOS (#92).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At this point, 70% of the top-rated games in history were Vermont Group
games - a trend that looks to continue as more and more top-rated
players (currently, 2/3rds of the top 50) join the VG and play a large
portion of their games there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks to everyone for your patience.  Thanks again to Alain Tesio,
who makes all this stuff much easier for you to view and research than
I could ever do.  There's a serious effort going on to automate as
much of this process as possible and make the the updates to the DRR
and JDPR more frequent than once per year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah - it was kind of neat to see that Dan Shoham had the longest
uninterrupted reign as number one (although Chris Aanstoos has only
about half a year to go).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I estimated that about 2000 games were completed on the Judges in
2003.  Could you tell me how close that estimate was?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By my count, 1775.  There were probably another 25 or so that I
didn't even bother to include in the DRR database (games that were
canceled before F1901B, variant test games where all seven powers
are the same person, etc.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The JDPR/DRR database still doesn't include BOUNCED games, which
may be considered Judge games.

DIPLOMACY AT PREZCON - SOON!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's time for the 2004 Diplomacy tournament circuit to begin WITH A BANG!  
Charlottesville, VA will play host to the long-running Prezcon game 
convention:  February 25-29.  And that means a Dip tournament, 
this year run by David Hood as he takes his Dixiecon system on the 
road for the first time.  Since 1987 Hood and the other Carolina 
Amateur Diplomats have been running a Diplomacy event in Chapel Hill, 
making it the longest-running Dip event on the east coast.  
Now the no-time-limits Diplomacy you know and love has invaded Prezcon.  
The event will have three rounds, with the Friday 6pm and Saturday 
6pm rounds played without time limits and the Sunday 8am round 
ending at an undisclosed time in the afternoon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is time for you to make plans to attend what promises to be a 
great beginning to the U.S. Dip scene for the new year.  
Prezcon will serve as the first event of the four-tournament 
Eastern Swing championship, as well as an early site for Grand Prix 
points, for those who want to wow the continental hobby during 2004.  
Importantly, it is also the site for over 65 games events, 
trials and demos in a format which has produced tremendous 
gaming experiences for hobbyists for the past 10 years.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What are you waiting for?  Email David Hood at gamerhood of charter.net 
for further info, and let him know you are coming. Then go to 
www.prezcon.com to preregister for this exciting event, 
held in the beautiful mountains of western Virginia.   
See you at the Dip board!

Hi Everybody;
As I'm sure you are all aware, the WDC is taking place this year in
Birmingham UK on July 16th, 17th and 18th (actually the con runs a little
longer than that, check out:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/manorcon/ for more
information).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well, us Europeans, being a fine bunch of people, have decided to come up
with a Diplomacy Tour.
On the week-end prior to the WDC, there will be a diplomacy convention in
France.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And, most importantly, on the week-end following the WDC, there will be a
diplomacy convention in Dublin, Ireland. Thats right folks, you heard it
here first, BoruCon V takes place July 23rd, 24th and 25th.
I very much look forward to crossing drinking glasses with you fine people,
and hereby send you some information on the subject.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm enclosing some attachments (all they are is HTML pages), and I hope
they get through, because sometimes they can get stripped.
If they do, and you want to know more, then contact me directly, and I
will forward you the info.

<br /><br /><b>Brian Dennehy (Fri, 30 Jan 2004 09:59:08)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In response to the lack of attachments, here is the info.
Scoring System document and Rules Document, available on request.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BORUCON V

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When is it?
BoruCon V starts on Friday July 23rd and runs until Sunday July 25th. The
first round is on Friday evening, and there is a round on Saturday and
Sunday. The Sunday round starts early to allow for plane-catching.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What scoring system is used?
BoruCon uses a scoring system that is similar to C-Diplo, but we have
modified it a little. Those of you who have played in the DipWorld
tournaments will recognise it, because its pretty much the same as the one
used there. There is more information on the scoring system in a document
accompanying this one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Where is the tournament being held?
BoruCon has been held in the Teachers Club since 2003. The Teachers Club is
in Parnell Square, which is in Dublin City Centre. Located just off 
O'Connell Street, there are many restaurants, bars, fast-food joints, shops,
cinemas etc, nearby. The Teachers Club has a bar on the premises, and serves
a variety of drinks to the weary traveller. An excellent advantage to the
venue is that the bar is a subsidised one, thus driving the price of drinks
downwards ... making the weary traveller more comfortable in his
surroundings. Sandwiches are also available inside the venue itself (as is
tea and coffee, as well as beer).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Where do I stay?
BoruCon has begun a relationship with the Kingfisher Bed &amp; Breakfast, also
on Parnell Square. Located, literally 100 meters from the venue, what could
be better than getting up at the last minute and still not being late for
the next round? There are other accomodations within easy walking distance
of the venue - Isaacs Hostel, Jurys Inn, and a variety of other B&amp;B
locations. For more information, contact us, and we can help you find the
accomodation that suits you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How much does it cost?
BoruCon costs 15 EUR per player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Are there other games being played?
BoruCon is a diplomacy-only convention. However, this does not mean that
other games are not welcome. The venue is an excellent spot to play other
games after, or before the diplomacy, and opens late, allowing lots of game
playing. Most players bring their own games to BoruCon, and it's very common
to see games being played all over the venue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How do I sign up?
Simply contact us we will sign you up. If you need any help with anything,
contact us and we will be only too happy to help you out in any way that we
can.

"What finally struck me the most was the kindness and sense of 
welcome of all the people I met, ... the way they make 
you feel immediately a part of the family" 
(2003 John Koning Award Winner for Player Performance Winner
Yann Clouet on playing diplomacy in Germany)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
EuroDipCon 2004 is drawing ever nearer. And already we, the organisers, 
are showered with questions. You clearly needed answers, 
you needed a regular EDC news bulletin, 
and this is its first issue. Here we go:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
V.V. from Finland asks:
"When is this EDC going to take place?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
V., the tournament starts September 23rd and ends September 26th. 
It will be held in Darmstadt, Germany, a city close 
to Frankfurt and its international airport. 
We have rented a venue that is located in the midst of a green park, a venue 
where we will not just play diplomacy, but many of us 
will also sleep and eat and, most of all, will meet new friends.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
G.B. from England wants to know:
"Do I have to stay in that place, I'd much rather get myself a five-star hotel?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Don't worry, G., we'll even help you find the best Hotel in town. 
While most players probably want to stay at the 
venue, not all can. 
Beds are reserved beds on a first-come first-served basis. 
The venue has about 70 beds and we expect many more people to come, 
so some will have to stay at the hotel anyway. 
There are many different hotels of all categories in Darmstadt. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E.J. from Norway had this question:
"Darmstadt, isn't that some boring village in East Germany?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No, E., Darmstadt is in the center of Germany, about 30 kilometers/20 
miles south of Frankfurt. But you won't have 
to go to Frankfurt to find pubs and bars and discos, 
Darmstadt is a student city and nights won't get boring. Then of 
course, we will play the whole day, drink the whole day... 
I doubt many will make it to the pubs anyway. 
As for finding your way to Darmstadt: check out: 
www.diplomacy-bund.de/cons/edc/int/location.php

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Y.C. from France is worried:
"I am guessing 'zat it all will be very expensive"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just the opposite, Y.! If you stay at the venue, three nights 
including breakfast and dinner will cost you 69-77 euro.
There is no tournament entrance fee for foreigners. 
And transportation should be cheap too. Just use the Frankfurt 
Hahn Airport, flying Ryanair. 
We will pick you up there (or at Frankfurt International or the 
train stations) You see, it's comfortable and cheap! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, F.O. from Ireland asked repeatedly:
"Will there be beer?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yes, T., there will be. Plenty! First rate German brew.
<i>((Twerg, the Pied Piper.... he'd sniff out some beer even if
there wasn't any.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I thought I'd better send in something before I become a subject for a 
search by either you or Leonard Nimoy.  Things have been way busier than
I've ever seen, but I think most of the fires have died down long enough
to annoy you with rants &amp; raves about our favorite universe.  This may
be a bit Stream-of-Consciousness, but I'm sure you won't object...
<i>((No, indeed, and I think I'll interrupt a bit and make it more so.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NBA:  does anyone have a working definition of "travelling"?  
<i>((Of course, Michael Jordan gets three steps, other superstars get two,
ordinary players get one, and mouthy rookies get called for travelling for
walking on the court.))</i>
Is it the same for every player?  
<i>((Of course not, see above....))</i>
Do you have to be a complete idiot to play for
Portland, or do they do the lobotomy when they trade for you?  
<i>((I think they just get bored...))</i>
Just curious...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NCAA basketball:  some team from the state of North Carolina will win. 
$100 bet per year on this every year in Vegas will yield a substantial
return over time.  For the daring speculator, bet Duke to make the Final 4.
<i>((I'll take the non-NC field against you.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NASCAR:  for some reason the most popular auto racing series in the
world decided to change its point system beginning in 2004.  Although I
was a part of the hue and cry about it initially, I don't believe that
it will change who wins most years.  Bet Ryan Newman for this year. 
What it might do is have a lot of teams lose their sponsors when the
10-race "playoffs" begin, if those teams aren't in them, leading to the
last few races having less than full fields.  No other sport has this
issue.  Could the powers-that-be here be as dumb as the ones who run
open wheel racing?
<i>((Yawn...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NFL:  As it's about 42 hours to kickoff of the Super Bowl, I'd better
get in here that New England will win 17-6, in what has the potential to
be the first Super Bowl ever without a touchdown (I'm tempted to predict
a 6-4 OT game).
<i>((Wrongo, I didn't really care much, but noticed that 1.5 million
people, including my boss, attended the Boston downtown celebration.
Lots of people didn't go for this, BUT, millions more would attend a
Red Sox celebration, including me.
I've got a great idea that they do a water parade down the Charles to the
Esplanade..... I'll plan it for October....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NHL:  What if they stopped dropping the puck and nobody noticed?  The
NHL is the prototype of how MLB could go before the end of this decade. 
Then again, the season can't end too soon for us Blackhawks fans.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MLB...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tampa Bay has to play 76 games against the Red Sox, Yankees, Blue Jays
and Orioles this year.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that
they won't win 10 of those games.  At least they now have Don Zimmer to
advise them on wrestling holds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The best cartoon I've seen all winter was one that had the owners of the
Red Sox and Yankees sitting at a poker table, and one was saying, "Oh,
Yeah?  I'll see your 8 million, and raise you 12 million!".  Kinda sums
it all up.
<i>((Chicago's a larger city than Boston.... why don't you bid?
And did you hear??
Wendy Selig Prieb is finally selling the Brewers, I think you should be buying.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Is Baltimore going to be better now that they've tried the "spending
money" route this year?  Can they be any worse?  The AL Wild Card will
come from the East, and right now they are my pick for it...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Why was it that the Red Sox fans were all dressing up like the Village
People during the playoffs in '03?  Anyone?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
George Steinbrenner had a recent heart ailment.  This was news mostly
because it confirmed he had a heart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Toronto may be the 5th best team in the AL this year, and finish a
distant 4th in their division.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anaheim is now the pick to lose to the Yankees in the ALCS.  In 7.  On a
walk-off home run in the 11th inning.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The White Sox are the most talented team in the AL Central, but they
couldn't win the AAA World Series.  It is possible that the AL Central
winner this year will be below .500, and maybe a LOT below .500.  The
only team in the division that improved themselves in the off-season was
Detroit, who provided Pudge with a place to grow old in obscurity.  The
Twins players are speaking of themselves in the past tense.  Kansas City
has Garth Brooks coming to Spring Training, as a player.  What if they
held a division race and nobody won?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Atlanta did it with mirrors last year.  They've done it with mirrors for
12 years running.  They'll do it again this year.  Bobby Cox for best
manager ever.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Florida won it all with a lot of luck, timely pitching, and the oldest
coach in sports.  The 2006 Marlins will have fewer than 6 players left
from that team, due to financial constraints.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The ivy in Wrigley Field turns red in the middle of October.  As God is
my witness, I did NOT know that before 2003.  Dusty Baker got the Cubs
within 5 games of winning the 2003 World Series, and was hailed as a
hero.  Grady Little got the Red Sox within 5 games of winning the 2003
World Series, and is now a Cubs advisor.  Question to Red Sox fans:  is
there anything we should know about him?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Roger Clemens was told that the over/under for how many wins he and Andy
Pettitte would get together for Houston in 2004 was 32.  Roger thought
for a second, then said, "well, Andy will get about 21, and I'll get
about 8, so I'd say `bet the over'".  I couldn't make that up.
<i>((Classic, I missed that one!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Prediction for 2004:  the 3rd place team in the NL Central will be more
than 20 games ahead of the 4th place team.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Despite the fact that I married a doctor, I'm not rich enough to buy the
Brewers.  Even if I could, it would probably be bad form for the owner
to show up to games in Cubs' garb.  Although I guess it wouldn't be any
worse than showing up dressed like a Commissioner.
<i>((Mortgage your house, you can do it....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Giants look good in 2004, if they can pass a drug test.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Expos may move to Las Vegas.  This explains why Pete Rose wants to
manage again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The word `contraction' keeps coming up.  The game probably doesn't need
teams that aren't serious about fielding competitive teams.  I recommend
that they drop any team who hasn't won a World Series in the last 80
years.  That will put both you and me out of our miseries.

Things are good, if a tad chilly, here in Schenectady.  Haven't yet 
gotten to a Sch.Wargamer Assn event, as I've been really busy with 
every aspect of life lately; I expect things to calm down a bit in 
April (!), so maybe by the summertime I can get into some FTF gaming

There's something that won't let me pick the Pats in the Super Bowl.  
<i>((My timing makes you look bad for game outcome, but good if
you were a bettor with the spread.))</i>
Actually, let me re-phrase that; there's something that won't 
let me pick against the Panthers.  They are just making things happen, 
and do what it takes to win.  Much like New England, really, but 
unless Coach Bill can whip up another miracle like two years ago, 
Davis and Foster will pound Carolina to victory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Maybe this year's loss will convince Eagle brass that they really 
need a top-flight receiver.  I thought I heard that TO was a free agent.  
Showboating aside, he can back up his arrogance, I'll give him that.  
Give McNabb someone to throw to (Pinkston and Thrash?  Please!), 
and next year they make it all the way.  As a Dallas fan, it killed 
me to say that, so I hope anyone who reads this in PA appreciates it.

Tens of thousands of them DO have jobs waiting here; their employers are

<i>((Methinks we could have the experience in a Presidential debate

when you were evading your Air National Guard duty; sir, what do you

duty, but are being locked into service by your Administration?
And with you as an example, how are we going to keep good men and women
continuing to serve our Country in the National Guard in the future?"
But nah, just a dream.
The facts as I understand them are these (tried to be conveyed with
as little partisanship I can manage): Bush got into the Air National
Guard and most definitely used connections to rise above the 
waiting list.
This was pretty much standard practice at the time though, much
research has documented this and it has been true in even worse
ways in earlier wars (e.g. in the Civil War with the cash payments).
He served adequately in the Texas Air National Guard until he 
was recruited to assist in a campaign in Alabama and his "records"
and "service requirements" were transferred to Alabama.
As I understand it, the Alabama record keeping was extremely bad,
and no one knows for SURE precisely what the facts are over the
episode, though I think everyone agrees he missed at least some service
time that he didn't make up.
But then he shifted back to Texas and eventually was awarded an
honorable discharge.
At the time, no one was worked up enough about the issue, and you
didn't have the Internet and E-Mail to communicate records between
Texas and Alabama, to worry about it too much.
Not to say that we won't hear a lot about it.
The real issues of course are about whether we are going to "live
September 11th" on an ongoing basis and the about budget/health care/economy
issues.
The parallels to the Clinton/Bush 1992 campaign are amazing.
I'm not up to being on another White House Health Care Reform Task
Force, so here's to hoping THAT doesn't come around again....))</i>

Hi, Boob; I thought you might enjoy this article by a techie on what passes
for "analysis" in the world of literature.
Do they do this stuff to you folks who do economic writing, or is it just
in the "humanities"?

<i>((I had fun with this.... a couple of reactions (wouldn't
want to call them analysis - and by the way I'm generally 
familiar with the content of what he's writing about):
(1) Note how Economists were conspicuously absent from this conference
he refers to.  This is not a coincidence, though the implications
are not necessarily positive to economists.
(2) Literary Criticism gets away with this (in my view) primarily
because he is wrong that this is a "branch of academia that has
been entrusted with the study of important problems".  This is
parallel to the "problems" in popular music (to intentionally
trivialize it) where they have to do something while they wait
around to uncover some really new ideas or directions that would
get them studying important problems.  I and some of my colleagues
have worked out a template against which to look at learning
based on the "three C's" (ya gotta have catchy jargon) of Content,
Context, and Community.  This is a "real" way to look at a situation
and a text, at direct opposition to the deconstructionist approach.
I could go on here...
(3) Economists CAN do this sort of thing, but generally don't.
(4) I'm in a branch of economics that is about as far from this
as you can get, I co-edit a professional journal that aspires
to be (and is) read interdisciplinarily (not a word, but you get
the idea) and I spend a lot of time communicating across disciplines.
(5) AND (in a not coincidental and interesting juxtaposition)
The Atlantic Monthly wrote an article about 15 years ago about
the branches of Economics where this is a problem and cited my
thesis advisor as a perfect example of the endemic problem.
They were right on and I laughed and laughed.  I think it is
"pre-Internet" as I can't find it in a careful search, it probably
was in 1988 or so.  I studied precisely HOW to go in the direction
of being an epistemologically challenged economist.  And then 
I didn't.  My advisor currently ignores me at conferences by
the way.....
Thanks!))</i>

I hope some people found my commentary on prison camp life

The trick is always finding something to do...

Around Christmas four inmates were caught trying to sneak off the 
grounds for a rendezvous with a woman (or women) at a nearby motel.
Stupidity rules the day, it just isn't worth it.
Not only will those inmates lose their "good time" and never see
a camp again - instead they'll be transferred to higher security
institutions - but they may also be charged with escape.
That could add between 18 months and 60 months to their sentences.
Since that excitement, the camp has seen some minor added restrictions
as "punishment" which in some respects seems unfair, since we aren't
the ones who ran off.
Still, it's easier to obey the rules than risk the consequences... for me 
anyway.
I just want to serve my time as quietly and peacefully as possible.

I always find it amazing how many people still don't understand mental
illness, with all the awareness efforts over the years. 
But many don't.))</i>
It was Mara's suicide attempt in 1998 that effectively ended my 
hobby participation - we split up in 2000 and finally divorced
last year, after which she remarried.
We've remained close friends throughout.
Mara was the first woman I ever dated (from back when I was 15),
and we survived some very trying times, as well as a lot of
wonderful fun experiences.
Mara wrote me four times in November, but not since.
On Jan 5th I finally confirmed my worst fears... on Dec. 11th
she and her husband William took their own lives.
Those who remember her fondly, please say a prayer for them and for

Regarding Steve Langley's first Retired Ramblings... yes, Steve, the economy
is getting better.
By economic definition, we are now in an expansion not a recession.
But my personal belief is that the economy may never "seem healthy"
the way it did before 9-11.... because the nation now knows how
drastically life can change, on a dime.
<i>((I don't really buy that one, since I feel like I was worried MORE
before 9-11 as a thoughtful observer of Al Qaeda, and since what really 
happens is that most people have stepped back into their previous thought
patterns, so I'm starting to become worried again like I was before 9-11.
People basically have psychological barriers that they erect if they 
don't want to be aware how drastically life CAN change.  Those barriers
are back up for those who can't or don't want to handle it.
Aren't they?))</i>
More importantly, though, the stock market is <b>NOT</b> the economy.
<i>((No kidding, though it has sent some people who retired in the 
go-go years back into the work force because they suddenly realized they
didn't have enough resources to stay retired.))</i>
Any veteran market-savvy pro will tell you the adage "Buy the rumor, 
sell the news" holds true most of the time.
If the stock market <b>IS</b> the economy, then we're much healthier
than I think, since we've seen a tremendous percentage bounce from 
the index lows... and then we would have already suffered a 30 to
40% decline in "the economy" from early 2000 to the 2000 elections.
Most of the economic growth of the very late 1990's was built on
phantom profits in over-extended stocks, rallying on radio and street
analysts suggesting investors demand outrageous 10% or higher annual
returns... and on fraudulent earnings reports we're still uncovering
day after day.
I'm not laying blame <b>anywhere</b> except at the feet of the general
population.... <i>((Note: the same general population that didn't 
pay attention to the obvious and growing threat of Al Qaeda...))</i>
regardless of party affiliation, those who tried to suggest moderation
were shouted down, those who poo-poohed the surplus forecasts are
now shocked to hear people believe the deficit forecasts.
In my experience, the economy is NEVER as strong or as weak as it is
made out to seem.
Extremes are overstatements.
"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" 
strikes again.
Bubbles burst.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Happy New Year!
Well, it is a wish, not a prediction.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was listening to the NPR financial news program. They interviewed
three economists to get comments on their predictions for the past year.
All three admitted that the stock market was doing lots better than they
had expected. They all three said that the actual economy wasn't doing
as well as the stock market. They all three said that with the US
government in a deficit status that the cost of borrowing money would go
up. One of them mentioned the tax breaks as being beneficial to the
economy through increased consumer spending. According to the retailers
consumer spending is not really increasing much. There was a three
percent increase in holiday shopping since last year, and last year was
an all time low.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When he mentioned tax breaks it dawned on me that one explanation for
the improved market was that the money from the tax breaks was being
invested. After all, that was a really huge tax break, and most of it
went to the rich. What do the rich do with all their money? They don't
spend it all, they invest it in hopes of making themselves even richer.
Makes sense to me at least. Is pumping more money into the stock market
a good way to improve the economy? I have no idea. I have the feeling
that it is just a way to move money around amongst the rich.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The current `mad cow' problems illustrate long term versus short term
thinking. Long term would have set up better testing, and excluded
diseased animals from the food chain. Short term, that is expensive,
cuts into profit, and makes us less competitive against other countries
that don't do the same. Long term results, our food is healthy and
preferred. Short term results, the industry is losing billions and will
continue to do so. Of course there is a short term bright side. The
government will bail the industry out and pass the expenses along to the
tax payer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As long as we have a system that rewards short term thinking and never
ever lets it suffer from ill result we will have short term thinking.
Too bad, but we are a short term sort of people.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My day started at 4:00 this morning. This having a sleep cycle that
doesn't match the planetary cycle is weird. But, since I have no regular
schedule to meet, I find letting myself sleep when I want to and wake
when I am ready seems to be liberating. Weird but liberating.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have about two inches of snow and there is still tiny little bits
falling. There is definitely something about snow that makes me feel
good. Most of my childhood was spent in snow country. I grew up walking
to school with drifts higher than my head. Of course my head was lots
closer to the ground in those days. Still, good childhood memories of
snow. Some sort of scary now that I am remembering, but good for all of
that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A gardening person on the radio just said that he expects the snow to
last for a week or two. That will be a record in my memory for this
neighborhood. I'll believe it when I see it.

The following from Jim Burgess:
<i>((As a card carrying PhD economist, let me say that your assessment of the
stock market is very astute. I've been telling people (I guess these
economists don't listen to me) that the stock market would rise this
fall for just the reason you state. Rich people have very low what
economists call marginal propensity to consume.... which just means that
if you give a poor person $100, they are very likely to have unrequited
wants for things that they will turn around and buy. Rich people don't
see $100 as being very significant relative to their unrequited wants,
so they save it, hoping to build up $100,000 to buy something really
big.
I've also been telling my broker that the REAL problem in the economy is
that business has been undervaluing the relationships between workers,
and overvaluing technological improvements like
computers. And that real return to real growth (which would float all
the boats in the economy) will not happen until companies "get" this.
Some of them have been getting the second part, but almost no one,
except a few people at IBM, seem to be getting the first part..... even
though all of the management gurus are talking about it. To my mind, the
gurus have been sounding nuts and impractical
which is why everyone's buying their books, but not really listening to
them....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm sure part of that is the idea that if the gurus are so smart why are
they not CEOs instead of writing books?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I find that I am allowing myself to be annoyed at things that are not in
my control and not even important. This is a sign that I need to so
something else. Maybe it is time to start watching DVDs. The thing that
has started to annoy me is that some blogs include links to things the
writer found interesting. I click on the link and most of the time I go
to the interesting link, and can return, but (now the annoying part)
occasionally I find myself somewhere else and the back button doesn't
take me back. So, not only did I not find out what was interesting, but
I lost the rest of the blog. Since most of the time don't remember what
path I took to get to the blog, and since I don't automatically put
blogs into favorites, I may never get back. Like I said, no control, and
not really very important.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Speaking of DVDs. I had thought I would be watching lots of DVDs once
retired. I even planned to join Netflix to keep the DVD supply up. I
have yet to watch a DVD. I was watching them more often before I retired
than I am now. But, I still have them to fall back on if all else starts
getting boring. I really thought retirement would be boring. Not yet at
any rate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Since I presently am catless, I'm really enjoying Steve's cat
discussions, I'm sure those of you who are not cat lovers will be
completely bored.
You were warned.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat used to have an open window in a bathroom to allow her the
freedom to come and go at will. The cold snap motivated me to close the
window. Actually I had to repair the window. It was open because a
previous cat tried to come through when it was closed. That cat never
was very bright. Breaking the window with its head probably didn't make
it any smarter. Anyway, the window is repaired and closed. The
temperature in the house is up from frigid to chilly, and the cat
doesn't seem to have noticed. Maybe she wasn't going out as much as I
had thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the upside of closing the window, there are no more night time visits
from feral cats. Since I stay up nights as much as not, and since I
spend that time either shut up in this room with the computer, or in the
room next with a book, and since I occasionally go to the kitchen for
something to eat or drink, I have startled several feral cats into
running for the open window. Mostly all I see is a very fast moving cat,
but there are enough differences in color for me to say feral cats.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have just learned from the BBC that Damascus, capital of Syria has
been lived in as a city for 5,000 years and counting. Some historians
put the number at 9,000 years. It is the oldest inhabited city in the
world. Most of its early history is vague but it survived Alexander the
Great, the Roman Empire, the Crusaders, a Mongol invasion, all several
hundred years apart. The latest invasion that took effect was when
Lawrence of Arabia took it from the Ottoman Empire and gave it to the
Arabs. It has been called Damascus for 3,300 years. I don't know why,
but just knowing this makes me feel good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat went outdoors for the first time since I fixed the window. She
figured out that she can not go out through the window immediately, and
I never heard a single mew of complaint. Being a cat, there is complete
freedom from logical inference. As soon as she figured out the ground
was covered with snow she went to the window. Turns out it was repaired
on that side too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
During the night more snow fell. I think I'll wait until tomorrow to go
to the store. I think I'll wait until it gets light to scrape the three
or so inches of snow off of my car. I do not want to be one of the first
to brave the roads. Out here in the boonies the snow rules.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I went out to scrape the snow from the car (four to five inches) and
when I got there I figured out that the car keys were still in the
house. I started back in and saw the broom that I keep next to the door.
Perfect implement I thought. I attacked the snow and set off the car
alarm.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is early Saturday morning. My schedule is becoming more attuned to
the planet's cycle. Much to my surprise I am sleeping from about 10:00
in the evening until 2 or 3 in the morning. I have never thought of
myself as a morning person before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Possible if I did not watch television the schedule would be different.
My TV is in the bedroom, so I climb into bed under the covers to watch
the one or two shows I watch of an evening, and then just turn off the
light and go to sleep. Very likely when the weather gets less chill I
will get up after watching TV and do other things, but for now, once I
get warm in the bed I don't want to leave it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That was in preface to the weather report. When I woke up at 2:30 this
morning I looked out to see what had happened in the night, and my car
was clear of snow except for the small bit I didn't manage to remove
yesterday. Again at 6 I took a look and saw that there was a sheet of
ice, but no snow. At 8, when I decided to go to the store, the car was
covered with an inch of snow. It has been snowing since. The lady at the
checkout stand told me to expect 7 inches of snow to fall. There is
already three to five inches on the ground in my front yard. I'm
beginning to think the gardener guy on the radio might have known what
he was talking about.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat has developed a specific mew to tell me to open the door for
her. The sound is quite distinctive. As soon as she has attracted my
attention and is sure I'm moving she trots directly to the door. I guess
it was inevitable that if we lived together long enough that she would
start training me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have taken to letting her be in the computer room with me. What I
won't let her do is touch anything. So, unless you are me, being in the
computer room is pretty boring. I set her up with a little cat bed. She
used it as soon as she saw it until she noticed that I didn't mind.
Then, because I wouldn't let her climb up on the table she stopped using
the cat bed, in protest. What she does now to entertain herself is meow
outside the door until I let her in, test me to make sure I still won't
let her touch anything, and then mew to be let back out. I let her out
at the top of this paragraph. She is mewing to be let back in, now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course while she is training me I am attempting to train her. I let
her in at the end of the above paragraph. She immediately went to jump
up on the smaller table. I put her back out. It all comes down to which
of us will hold on the longer. My parents always did say that my most
telling quality was my stubbornness. But cats are relentless. She is
mewing to be let back in.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The reason she wants back in is not because she likes my company or
likes the computer room as much as it is warm in here. I heat my house
on the Japanese model rather than the American model. The only room that
I heat is the one I'm in. I have small heaters in each room where I
spend a lot of time. I find my heating bills are much easier to control
this way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another word about the cat's logical inference. The cat has refused the
cat bed except for the first time she saw it. I just moved it to the
other side of the room and she has taken possession. She seems quite
comfortable too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sunday, 2:00 am. So much for my attuned sleep cycle. I got into bed to
watch television and fell asleep before the first show started. I woke
up after the two shows I wanted to watch had run their course, turned
off the TV and went back to sleep for another couple hours. My day today
started a bit before midnight Saturday. The shows were both reruns. Oh
well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just heard a BBC interview with an Iraqi University Professor who gave
these statistics: Under Saddam there was 25poverty. Under US control there is 80there is such a security issue. The Iraqi people were at first overjoyed
at the arrival of the Americans. That has changed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Halliburton is the biggest US employer in Iraq. They import nearly all
of their employees. The stated reason is security. What little
infrastructure we have rebuilt has also been the work of imported
contact workers. Money is being spent on Iraq but little of it is going
to the Iraqi people.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mars is of course the exciting story of the day. So far the NASA
websites have not had anything except background story to show. I will
go back later.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just stepped outside to put a recycle item into one of the four boxes
I keep on my front porch. It was a bit past dawn, so the clouds, lit
from underneath, were various shades of pink. I was much taken by a
flight of birds. I watched as they crossed the sky heading east. More
followed, and still more. Then there was one contrarian bird heading
west. Still more birds flying east. Hundreds of them I think, although I
didn't count. Finally I started shivering and so had to retreat inside.
They were still coming. And that's one of the reasons why I live out in
the boonies.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Monday, 3:00 am. I just stepped outside to check the snow level. Looks
like another inch of snow, not the seven that was predicted. But there
is more coming. This is getting to be the longest period in my memory
where there is snow in Seattle. It is very pretty where I stand. Of
course I stand on my front porch and can go back inside at will.

Robert Heinlein wrote a book called `Door Into Summer'. He got the idea
from a cat that when winter came would go from door to door begging to
be let out, until it discovered that the door led to winter. Then it
would go to the next door and beg again, always searching for the door
into summer. My cat is a bit like that. She begs to be let into the
computer room where it is warm if boring. Then, once warm she begs to be
let back out, in hopes that the other side of the door is also warm.
Then she begs to be let back in. When she does come back in she heads
directly to my recently vacated chair. I only vacate the chair to let
her in, but how is she to know? Constant power struggle here.

I've gone into five digits on Freecell. Only 990,000 games to go. I was
told that there is one game in the first 32,000 that can not be beaten.
I was also told that the whole 1,000,000 games are different from each
other and that, possibly, eight of them can not be beaten. The first
10,000 can be beaten, unless I somehow managed to not play the
unbeatable game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The CSI forensic type television is starting to bug me with their
assumption about knives. The idea that a killer might cut himself while
killing with a knife is something that should be examined, but not
something that should be expected. Last night the weapon was a hunting
knife. This hunting knife had a raised cross guard between the hilt and
the blade. The very thing to protect the hunter from slipping while
butchering his kill. Not only that but the victim had his throat cut.
The sort of wound made by pulling the knife across the throat. Not the
sort of move to cause a self inflicted cut.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Didn't bother the CSI man, he was sure the killer would have cut
himself. Apparently in TV CSI land they always do. Well, I've only seen
three shows where the weapon was a knife, and in all three the killer
ended up with a cut on the hand wielding the knife. About the only way
that could happen is if the knife was stabbed into the victim with
enough force to drive the knife back when resistance was met. Seems to
me one of the CSI shows had wounds like that. They present these shows
as being very scientific. They really need to get it right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In one show the bad guy was a tennis pro who preyed on his teenage
students. He killed one girl after binding her with tennis racket
stringing stuff. Used to be catgut but I'm not sure they still call it
that. The CSI guys matched the cut ends of the line used to bind the
girl to a tennis racket he had strung for her and from the tennis racket
to the spool of twine in his utility bag. So, apparently the evidence
indicates that he tied the girl up and then strung her tennis racket. I
don't know.

I saw a movie this weekend. I had to go near to my favorite theater and
so I managed to talk myself (severe arm twisting involved) into taking
in a movie on the trip. I saw `The Last Samurai'. Tom Cruise really does
a good job. He went from drunken hero to nobility and was believable in
both. Nobility in the sense of noble in action, not in the sense of
being a prince.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree, I thought "The Last Samurai" was lots better than
a lot of the buzz it got.
And Ken Watanabe did give a deep and nuanced performance (which has gotten
him some recognition).
And I wouldn't have thought that Tom Cruise could have been that effective
either.
Unfortunately, you really do want to see all of the incredible detail
on the big screen, and I think it's out of that now, but still even worth
renting now.

Arcadia' on Friday at eight where I am.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Joan and God hold conversations. He asks her to do things. Joan rarely
understands what God wants but she has learned that she ends up feeling
better after doing what God asks. Well, most of the time at least. There
was one real disaster.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I do think it is interesting that this time slot seems to pick
up these kinds of shows.
I can't get Charlotte to watch the show, but I'm easy, like Steve.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have been asked about my cat. Why do I not use the cat's name. I don't
think of the cat having a name all that much. When I brought her home I
called her Adelanta. I was in some sort of Greek mythic phase I suppose.
Anyway, no one called her that. Part of the time she was called Gickers,
part of the time Wiggie. I never did figure out what the code was. The
people who called her Gickers and Wiggie are not here now. Adelanta
seems not to fit. She has been around for nearly ten years and I don't
actually know her name. She responds well to cat. That is what I call
her when I talk to her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The snow didn't quite last the full two weeks predicted by the gardener
guy on the radio. I was mostly gone yesterday and all gone today, at
least where I live.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat still doesn't spend a lot of time out of doors. You have heard
the theory that cats pause at the doorway to make sure it is safe before
they venture beyond the door? Well my cat hasn't hear that theory. I
open the door and she goes through at top speed. The speed is why I
thought to call her Adelanta. She was always the fastest cat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I open the door to get the mail or the paper or both as the case may be
and she goes out like a streak of grey. I get the whatever and return to
the door. Usually there is no sight of the cat. I open the door to go
back in and she beats me through the door. That's it for her outdoors
venture these days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She will no doubt change that as the weather warms. This morning I
opened the door to look at the weather and she was gone. I didn't
actually go anywhere and so when I went back in she was still out. I
left her there for a few minutes and opened the door again. She was in
through it before I got it wide enough to use myself. The warmer it
gets, the longer she will wander before coming back to the door. I guess
I will have the opportunity to open the door on spec a lot in the days
to come. My fault for fixing the window.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been thinking about the nanotechnology I wrote about a while back.
If DNA can be fixed as it breaks people will live for really long
periods of time. I see no reason to expect that they will stop having
children. That means new people coming in and many times fewer leaving.
Planet Earth is already crowded. Where will all these people live?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've come up with a speculative solution that is based on possibility
more than not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What we need to do is build ourselves some more planets.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Oort Cloud contains more mass than all of the rest of the solar
system except for Sol itself. Much of it is in the form of chunks of
dirty ice. Some of it is iron, carbon, and any other element that you
can name. Lots of raw material.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are five L-points (Lagrangian points) in the earth orbit around
the sun. L-points are spread in equal distances around the sun. They are
points where the gravity of the sun and earth intersect in such a way to
make stable gravity wells. Gravity wells hold things in place. Generally
L-points are home for small rocks and dust.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We are just now starting to create anti-matter. The really large
particle accelerators can create anti-matter. It has already been done
at the atomic level. In order to make lots of it we will need to expend
lots of energy. The best resource for this is the sun. Huge particle
accelerators built in near space using solar power would give us nearly
free (from the energy cost point of view) anti-matter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anti-matter, as anyone who has watched any of the Star Trek shows knows
is a great source of energy. Using anti-matter energy as our ship's
drives would allow us to travel to the center of the Oort cloud at a
constant one gravity acceleration / deceleration for the entire trip.
The trip out would take just under two years. Only a slightly higher
acceleration would cut the time dramatically, but lets err on the side
of comfort.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once there we would have to collect a whole lot of proto-comets. Using
our nanotech computers we could pretty much count on all of our ships
working in concert, even though they might be more than a light year
apart from each other. We could drop large chunks of material back
towards earth, and aim them with sufficient precision to have them
collide at the L-points. The collisions would be explosive. Most of the
mass velocity kinetic energy would be converted to heat in the
collisions. Most of the heat would be absorbed by raising the dirty ice
to water and then steam. The L-point gravity well would tend to hold
most of the mass in place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The rest, mostly steam, would be carried by solar winds back out to the
Oort Cloud as tiny pieces of ice. Recycling in a sense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We would have to accrete material to all five L-points at about the same
rate. As the amount of mass grew, the gravity of the mass would start to
help us. And because the L-points tend to hold stuff in place, and
because as more material arrives, the L-point effect will increase in
such a way as to become even more stable, dropping material into the
five L-points will be self correcting to a certain degree. Once we had
enough mass stored in the five L-points we could start tossing the
heavier elements at them. That would be less than half way through the
process. We need the heavier elements, principally iron, to be the cores
of the new planets.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The point of the iron is to allow the new planets to generate their own
magnetic fields just as earth does. It has not been proven but there is
strong evidence to indicate that a magnetic field is required for life.
At the very least they act as a shield to ward the solar wind. We need
the magnetic field but we would also like the new planets to be less
dense than earth generally. The less dense, the larger we can make them
and still end up with one earth gravity at the surface. The larger the
planet, the more surface for living space.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bottom line, we can build five new planets in a ring around the sun.
They can have as much water and land as we decide works best. Earth is
about six parts in seven water on the surface. Possibly that is what is
required to support life. I don't know. Possibly less water and more
land will work as well. We can build the planets as we choose.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once the five new planets have been built we can terra form them. That
is, we can seed them with earth plants and animals and let them build
stable eco-systems. Of course they won't have all the fossil fuels that
this planet has, but they will have lots of room for people to live.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That brings up the transportation problem. Once again antimatter will
serve to drive really huge transport ships. We will need to move
billions of people. That's a lot of trips in a lot of really large
ships. We do not have the resources to build the fleet we need here on
earth. So, in parallel with the building of the planets we will need to
build a resource stockpile from which to build the ships. The places for
that stockpile are outside of the plane of the ecliptic. There are many
L-points that will serve, but the most obvious is the point at right
angles from the plane of the ecliptic at the distance of the earth from
the sun. With all six planets growing, that L-point will be the most
stable. Well, those L-points, there are two of them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course this is only a stop gap. By the time we build the five new
planets the population may be larger than even they can support. I'm
thinking that lengthened human life span is the big danger of nanotech,
not grey goo.

There will probably be fewer of these in the future. I have finally
decided to get off my metaphoric duff and do some real writing. Which

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have a book in progress and I have had many ideas for it come and go
while not writing. Some of the ideas are still with me. I'm hoping I
managed to keep the good ones.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was asked if the planet building idea was from Science Fiction or an
original idea. I thought it up. I have not read all or even most of the
recent SciFi offerings so I have no idea if I'm the only one who has
thought it up. It is part of one of the many story ideas that I
mentioned coming and going above.

Bush says we are going to put men on Mars. He has a plan. Most of it
will take place long after he has passed from office. I'd really like it
to happen. The plan is to stage the trip from a colony on the moon.
Sounds like a plan all right. I doubt he has put a lot of thought into
it, or that his staff has either. Part of the plan is to divert the
money from the International Space Station, resting it on the backs of
the Russians.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A Colony on the moon would be a lot easier to establish using a space
station as a staging area than the earth. There is a lot that has to go
into a colony on the moon. Lots of heavy lifting out of the earth orbit.
It is a lot more difficult to do that lifting using vehicles that are
built to travel from earth to moon. Sending stuff to a near orbit, say a
big space station, and then use a different technology entirely to move
stuff from earth to moon orbit makes a whole lot more sense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh well. The plan is probably one of the set like `no child left
behind'. Good plan for getting votes, but not one that they actually
plan to implement. I'm betting the only part that ever does get
implemented is the part of diverting funds from the International Space
Station. After all, the money for the tax refund payout has to come from
somewhere.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My hope is that Bush will make enough people upset to actually lose his
election. It is his to lose. If he just coasted he would have no
problem. But maybe he will try harder than that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wrote five new pages yesterday. They are first draft. The way I work
is to do a draft and set it aside for a day or so. I may do more first
draft in that time. Then I do a reread and add detail. I may do cuts as
well. That becomes second draft. That too sits for a while. Then I read
it again and add in all the ideas I've had about it since I did the
second draft. That isn't actually the final draft yet, but it is lots
closer. I find I am still making changes to stuff I wrote years ago.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Today is my mentoring day. I started doing this early in December. Since
then there have been two school closures due to power outage, and two

nearly a month ago. I think I'll be all right though. I've been thinking
about it a lot.

Last night, late, I logged on to write a short paragraph saying that I
had pretty much blown off writing for the day. Instead I opened up my
first five pages and did a second draft. I made a few changes, added
some description. Rewrote some dialogue completely, and ended up with
nine pages. So, I guess I didn't blow off writing yesterday after all.
Today by the way is Sunday.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Something funny happened while I was listening to the radio earlier this
morning. Suddenly there was a weather report. The meteorologist said
that last night had a near record low temperature, and that tonight was
going to be even colder. I thought to myself that I hadn't really
thought last night was all that cold. Then he signed off, from Hartford
Connecticut. You have to love NPR. Where else will you get the Hartford
Connecticut weather report, not counting Hartford Connecticut?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I used to think I was fairly aware of my surroundings. I'm not as sure
now. I was just listening to an NPR interview with a man who wrote a
book about advertising. Anecdotes were told about some really big
advertising campaigns down through the years. I didn't recognize any of
them. I kept waiting to hear about `Where's the beef?', the only ad I
could think of at the moment, but it didn't make the cut. `I want my
MTV!' was the big winner. The guy who wrote the book pointed out that
the ad for MTV was essentially an ad for a show that was nothing more
than ads for music. With MTV ads became entertainment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had to think about it for a long time. I don't think I've ever watched
MTV. Oh well.
<i>((I don't have cable either.... but I have seen some music videos.
Even for songs I like, the music videos don't impress me much.
This undoubtedly is a big factor in some of the things I wrote about
last issue.
Jack White is a huge personality, and he probably makes great music videos.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now there is a show about words being voted into the English language. I
didn't know it worked that way. The American Dialects Society are voting
for the word of the year. That is, a word that is new this year and is
most likely to become a keeper. One of the entrants, `frogmarching' was
rewritten on the floor to `freedommarching'. The apparent winner

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Was..... did I do something here??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One more NPR item. A music teacher has developed a digital technique for
slowing music down without changing the pitch. Normally if you play
music faster the pitch goes up. `Alvin and the Chipmunks' is the classic
there. Slow it down and the pitch gets lower, and the music is changed
to the point of not being recognizable. What the computer does is slow
the music down without losing anything. I just heard an Irish jig that
was slowed down so that the notes could actually be recognized, and the
theme pointed out. At normal speed it was moving so fast that there was
nothing to point to. Along the same lines, a piece of Rap music was
played at normal speed. The only thing that you could grab on to was the
rhythm. The words were a blur. Put it though the computer and the rhythm
was still there, but the words were all recognizable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He uses the technique to teach music. I'm thinking it will hit all the
TV spy shows within a month or two.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat has definitely learned how to talk to me. Granted she has a
limited vocabulary. So far I only understand one word. She just told me
or asked me, depending on who you think is in charge around here, to
open the front door and let her go out. That is a first for us. Until
now she used a running escape as her way to get out of the house. But
now, she can leave any time she can get my attention.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Actually there are two words of cat I have learned. She uses a different
mew for `let me in' than she does for `let me out'. `Let me in' is a lot
more plaintive. No less effective for all of that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have also developed a self petting technique for the computer room.
It is only good when I'm not typing. I let my right hand dangle towards
the floor and she walks back and forth under it, letting it scrape along
her back. I pet her in passing as it were. I'm not sure when she
invented `self petting' but we have been doing it for several days now.

I'm closer to a twenty four hour cycle these days. I'm sleeping longer.
Most of my life I have slept four and a half hours with a short wake-up
in the middle of that. That was controlled by staying awake until about
four and a half hours before the alarm. But even without the alarm, I
would wake up. I attributed the short amount of sleep to being an
insomniac. When I went into the stay up until sleepy, get up when awake
cycle I was still sleeping the four and a half hours. Lately I have been
sleeping longer. I'm waking after six and a half hours these days. I'm
not sure if the rest of you find that as interesting as I do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm listening to NPR while typing. The cat sleeps. Political pundits are
busy explaining why Dean isn't as strong a contender as everyone
thought. Then they moved on to Bush. One of them explained why, despite
his background, no one thinks that Bush is part of the elite. He is such
a bumbler when he speaks that it is hard to think of him as elite. The
old incompetence defense. Bush isn't smart enough to be elite. He is
smart enough to be president. He walks a fine line.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The same pundit who says that it is not Bush, but the Bush bashers who
are elite is saying that Iraq is a success because it is not as bad as
Vietnam. I'm thinking double-speak is too much a part of our life
anymore.

About two weeks ago I got the rebate forms for my Dell purchases. The
on-line site that I got them from advised that I call a service number
if I didn't have my rebate in eight weeks. In eight weeks I would
probably have forgotten about it. I'd remember sooner or later, but
probably not at the eight week cut-off. Turns out Dell was being very
conservative. The rebate checks arrived today.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I drove them to the bank. When I left, the three large branches that
fell from my tree back in the heavy windstorm that blew down trees were
still where I had left them. That is, on the piece of my land that
fronts the street. There is about a fifteen foot sloped hill between the
hedges that define my yard and the street. I piled the fallen branches
there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When I got home, a huge wood chipper was parked half on the street and
half on my slope. The slope is nearly flat to the street for the last
five feet or so, and at a 45 degree angle for ten feet. Anyway, there
was this giant machine parked where my limbs used to be. The limbs
appear to have been moved or chipped. Either works for me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It occurred to me that just possibly I'm reading more into the cat's
`open the door' mew than is really there. Just possibly the cat speaks,
I get up and open the door, and the cat leaves because I have opened the
door, not because of anything the cat said. So, yesterday morning I
opened the door every time the cat said anything. Most of the time the
cat just looked at me. The final mew was her `open the door' mew and
that was the only time she left. I may be projecting but I think she
thinks I don't understand much of what she has to say.

Today I hit the first non-binary palindromic number of freecell games
since I hit five digits. I still have not discovered the unbeatable
game. I'm playing a lot less since I started writing instead, but I make
a point of playing at least one game a day, just to keep things moving.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Last night I listened the `State of the Union' speech. A few things
caught my attention. In order, the round of applause when Bush said that
the `PATRIOT Act' was about to expire; Bush suggesting we need an
amendment to the constitution to define marriage as a union between a
man and a woman; and in its absence, the man on Mars mission. I guess
going to Mars was a good idea last week.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We can't pass an amendment guaranteeing equality between men and women.
At least we didn't get that amendment through. I thought that actually
needed to be the law of the land, considering the way we live and who we
are. I'm not sure a definition of marriage is the sort of thing that
actually belongs in the constitution. I'm hoping it was more an appeal
to his religious fundamentalist base for votes than a serious
suggestion.

Two Thursdays in a row with the kids. I am starting to get to know them
better.
I still want to read to the kids. It is my theory that the best way to
get kids interested in reading is to expose them to material that is
worth reading. I'm thinking the Harry Potter books.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I envision my reading to them as a group for about fifteen minutes
before starting the individual reading practice. I think another couple
of sessions, just to get well past my learning curve on what I'm doing
now, and I'll talk to Maureen, the volunteer coordinator, about adding
some story reading to the process.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Puget Sound Energy just sent me an apologetic letter about the recent
power outages. I'm actually thinking the outages were not their fault.
Still, I guess they are getting a lot of feedback from people who do
think it their fault. I really didn't need an apology. I'd just as soon
they spent the money on trimming trees.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The giant chipper is gone. I have some really huge mud tracks in the
grass near the street. It happens. Not the first truck or car to park on
the verge and tear it up leaving. It all grows back. The chipper was
part of a project to cut down a tree across the street from my house. I
sort of watched it happening. That is, I'd look for a bit and then go
back in the house, and come back and check again later.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tree was a very tall fir tree. I'm not sure what species. First a
man in a safety harness went up the tree and lopped off branches which
were dropped to the ground using safety lines to direct te fall away
from the house on the next lot. Once the branches were trimmed off, he
topped the tree. Actually, he topped it twice. The real top came down
with gidance, and then he dropped down about thirty or forty feet and
topped what was left. Then the trunk was cut down. They used a giant saw
and cut it fairly close to the ground. More safety lines guided the fall
of the log, but it still shook my house when it hit the ground. They
sawed it into logs and loaded them onto a big truck that was parked just
up the street from the chipper. Then they chipped the odd limbs that
were too small to make into logs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The whole thing took about a day and a half. Most of the time was spent
lopping off branches and topping the tree. Cutting the trunk down and
making logs out of it went pretty quickly. All the equipment and the
logging truck are gone now. About the only sign that they were around
are the track on my verge, some sawdust, and the stump of the tree. The
stump is so close to the ground that it will disappear under brush in a
season. The sawdust will be gone in the next rain, and the verge will
have grass again very soon. The stuff never gives up.

<i>((We had something similar happen in the yard of the house behind us.
We'd hated the trashy trees that were there ever since we moved in, our entire

Well, the new owner of the house also apparently thought the trees were trash,

We tossed all of the branches that had fallen off these trees over the years in

They disappeared into the chipper too....
But it will be interesting to see what happens to our backyard shade garden

Our Trumpet Creeper and Rosebush will be much happier to be sure.

The squirrels (whom we feed along with the birds) were quite upset at

the trees on either side.
Personally, I'd like to see them put in some new, less trashy trees that permit
some sunlight, but not full sunlight on our yard.

Interesting thing happened Friday night. I decided that the TV was too
rerun to watch, so I went to the computer room and turned on the radio,
just in time to listen to the Orson Welles radio version of `The War of
the Worlds'. My mother was frightened by the original show while I was
in the womb. She used to claim that it marked me for life.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I tuned in at just about the part that most of America had. The top
rated show that night was actually `Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy'.
For some reason that show didn't play that night, and so most of America
changed the station just in time to miss the introductory explanation
that this was a radio play. What they thought they heard was a news
bulletin interrupting a dance music show.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I managed to tune into the show at just about the same point as everyone
else did, only sixty five years later.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can see why people were frightened. There was great attention to the
sound effects. The various reports supposedly came in via radio, over
the phone, and some from the radio station itself. Right now I'm
listening to an over confident troop commander explain that everything
is under control. He was toast.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After about ten minutes it becomes pretty obvious that this is a radio
play, not an actual event. But those first few minutes were pretty
convincing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sorry, it turns out that this was an adaptation, not the original.
Modern actors were reading the lines. Leonard Nimoy was reading the
Wells role.

The following from Ken Goldsmith on my ramble about Iraq:
"As for Iraq, I disagree that the UN is a good choice to help Iraq write
their constitution. The UN is so large and with so many factions that
they would never turn out a useful document. Perhaps some
non-muslim, unrelated country would volunteer to help them. Norway is
trying to help Sri Lanka sort out its problems, and although they have
not succeeded, they have not alienated either faction YET. A country
like Holland, Belgium, Finland, something like that could offer to help
and would have no self-interest in the results."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Good point. I was going with the UN without actually giving it a lot of
thought. Just someone other than US.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I spoke too soon about the lack of piracy news in our media. The BBC had
a report on the growth of piracy last night, and NPR, who probably
listens to the BBC, had a story on piracy today. NPR had a few more
details. There were 467 reported incidents of piracy last year. It
varies from hit and run robbery to killing the crew and taking the
entire ship. There has been an increase of the latter.
<i>((Most of this occurs in the area between Southeast Asia and 
Australia.
It is an amazingly dangerous thing to be on a ship out there.
I probably wouldn't do it, and I'm a risk taker type.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On CNN last night Robert Novak (famed for revealing the name of a CIA
operative) was doing an analysis of the Howard Dean concession speech. A
part of the analysis was the significance of Dean's wearing of his suit
coat while giving the speech. Novak read more into it than the possible
temperature in New Hampshire at the time. CNN obviously needs more news
to fill the time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Novak concluded that Dean was trying to distance himself from the
emotional growl with which he admitted defeat in Iowa. That Dean was
afraid that if he removed his coat it would remind his followers of his
instability. Well, I paraphrase, Novak used a whole lot more words.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dean wasn't the only one in the room wearing a coat. I think the hall
doors may have been open because there was a large crowd of Dean
followers both inside and outside. It seemed to me that temperature
played a bigger part than the possible impression wearing a coat might
make on the crowd. But then, I'm not a CNN analyst.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The cat and I have a routine we go through when I take a shower. First I
place the clothes I will wear post shower in a tidy pile on the couch in
the room where I have my DVD player. I do this because that room can be
kept warm. I take the shower and the cat and I go into the warm room. I
towel off and the cat watches me, from her perch on top of the pile of
clothes. Then I pick the cat up and set her beside the clothes in order
to take the top two items, which I then don. The cat immediately returns
to the top of the remaining pile. Once I have my first two items on, I
once again pick up the cat and set her beside the pile. I then take the
top piece of clothing and put it on. The cat watches this from the top
of the remaining pile. Sometimes when I pick her up for the third time
she gives it up and watches me from a different part of the room until I
finish dressing myself. Sometimes she hangs in until I have taken all of
the clothes out from under her.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once I am clothed again, I sit to put on my socks. The cat attempts to
climb on to my lap. It is nice to have something you can depend on.

I'm listening to a Academy Awards prediction show. The people doing the
show are NPR, a local to Seattle area movie critic and the show host.
They both were a bit surprised over the Johnny Depp nomination, but
after discussing it they decided that it was totally deserved. Maybe
they were surprised because it was such an outrageous performance, not
because it did not deserve recognition. I have long been a Depp fan and
truly hope he wins.
<i>((Me, too, he won't but he should.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not sure `The Return of the King' deserves all the nominations it
has collected, but I suspect that they are for the entire trilogy, not
just the one movie. I am dismayed to find that I didn't see a few more
of the nominated works this year. Most years I have seen most if not
all. Oh well.

<i>((Agreed, as a movie, the third one seemed the weakest of the three.
I've heard the "but it was a great trilogy and deserved attention as
a trilogy" argument, but no one gave the Star Wars trilogy (which followed
a similar pattern) such attention.
And the political process that excluded "Cold Mountain" from the major
awards also was unfair.
But the Academy is nothing if not political.
Still, always a great show.
I've seen most of the nominees, and really am impressed with the
"Whale Rider" star Keisha whatever her name is getting nominated.
That was my kind of movie, though Charlotte didn't like it as much,
as usual.))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Thanks to Tom Howell for our Boardman Number, 2003G.
Note what I said at the top of the szine, and then we have
just seven BN games (a bit more than John Boardman noted in
his last issue, with a surge at the end of the year).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Note that we salute all Summer/Winter deadlines, even though there
are no orders due.  This is a press opportunity and ensures that you 
have enough negotiating time for Fall orders.

(JEFF to ANDRE): It occurs to me that in my hello/thanks for the statue note
I forgot to also thank you guys for helping us to kick the British out of our
country during that Revolution skirmish.
My apologies for my bad manners.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SUNDSTROM-SCHMIDT): Did you feel any better when Green Bay let up that 4th and 26?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): There is no Captain's Log on Ferengi ships. 
On this ship I'm "The Franchise Manager".
I've received communiques from two alien groups, but our compic is down and
I don't even know which species is which.
I'm converting my Ferengi ship into a fighing machine by selling half of our
assets and I've made a couple of Ferengi allies with a couple of bribes.
I'm also breaking a promise to one of the aliens based on a hunch.
Kirk out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I've seen all of the Star Trek and Next Generation, and 80% of the
rest, including about 10 Trek novels.
Thru all of that I actually thought they were saying proton torpedoes, not photon.
I've convinced that my photo should be in the dictionary next to the word
"attention deficit".

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
Fall 1915 is one game year by that measure.
PS I may do a GM judgment call that no "real" center movement
has occurred if there are only small insignificant trades of
centers that are done.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
The two man race among those who actually are playing is winding down....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Since I delayed some games above, it also seemed only fair to delay this one too.
It won't hurt anything for you Yuppie types.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I don't have orders from all of you, and so as not to force "lowest card",
I'll give you all to the next deadline too.

1) I'm keeping only one list for the new game now up above.
This is scary, the game has gone on for six years now, hasn't it.

(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "The lights are out all over Europe..."
