<p><br><p><br>I hope everyone who celebrates it had as Merry a Christmas as I had, and I 
hope you all have a Happy New Year!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>In retrospect, I should not have tried to stuff another issue in before Christmas.
I am sitting here two days afterward finishing up an issue that I started working
on a month ago.
There really isn't anything interesting to say about that except to say that
I took a Thanksgiving vacation for the first time in years and the usual Christmas
rush of singing events and parties led to no time for the szine.
Plus, the fall course that I teach had a later than usual final exam date,
so Christmas popped up just after that.
Thus, while this issue is very late, it is no indication of future delays.

<p>
Oh yes, I also didn't take my own advice very well in my last issue and
got totally caught up in day to day issues of the Presidential recount,
mostly because I had to HUNT for the real news since our national news media
did such a terrible job of reporting it.
The magnitude of my interest is expressed by some (dated) letters and commentary
herein.
As a quote up top, I liked best the one from the Temple mathematician, John Poulos, 
as quoted in the <i>New Yorker</i>:
``The margin of error in this election is substantially larger than any
possible margin of victory."
That has some rather nice subtleties as one mulls it.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!
Some other options are out there.
Mark Kinney's szine also is finally out,
Mark is looking for standbys and players too.
Contact Mark NOW at 4820 Westmar Terrace #6, Louisville, KY  40222, (502) 412-3079; 
alberich of iglou.com and get on his subscription list.
I'm in the game and you CAN'T miss watching ME play....
there or somewhere else.

<p>
Plus, we are preparing to ``take over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
As Michael Lowrey already has announced, <i>Carolina Command and Commentary</i>
will be opening a Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
This will give me better coverage of the Dixie hobby and provide Michael a 
congenial place from which to publish.
Don Williams also wishes to make a comeback and quite a comeback it will be.
He's starting a new game of Diplomacy with some classic ``old fart'' types
and you'll see it as a subszine here.
I won't let him start until he gets his endgame statement in for the last 
such game, Arsenic and Old Farts, which had Pete Gaughan as GM.  
I think Don is serious and finally will stop procrastinating on both of these,
which he has been talking about for half a year.
I will give him the rest of the ``announcement'' rights on what he is going
to call the subzinny and who will be playing in it.

Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<p>
Through Stephen Agar's (who is still
in charge here) Postal portion of the Pouch:

<p>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen's more extensive efforts at (note the new address):
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com

<p>
The most recent issue of <i>TAP</i> also can be accessed through
Pete Sullivan's web page and very occasionally David Wang's:

<p>
1) David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site also allows you to follow (VERY, VERY badly) John Caruso's postal
baseball league that I am in.
John and Kathy Caruso are now up on E-Mail and if David doesn't
get off his butt soon and start updating the page more frequently, 
John probably will go invent his own web page.
This is a problem at the present time....

<p>
2) For the most recent issue of Pete Sullivan's subszine 
check out (this address will be changing shortly):

<p>
 http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Pete is looking for Railway Rivals standbys, but otherwise,
he is full with games at the moment.

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR MARK BERCH</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>I really thought we were going to find Gregory Stewart before the deadline.
We did have a lead on his son that someone was pursuing, but I have no
contact.  You still can find Mr. Stewart for the twenty-five dollar prize.

<p>
Mark Berch's name has come up a few times lately.  I'm sure more than one of
you knows his current address - hell, it might not even have changed, 
Rod Walker's hasn't
[speaking of Rod, Conrad von Metzke reports that Rod is recovering nicely
from a heart attack; best of wishes to Rod Walker in his recovery;
and interested parties may E-Mail Rod at: catullus of pacbell.net] -
but getting Mark to write a letter to me is worth fifty bucks if you
get him to do it before the deadline for Issue 245!
Mark is famous for editing <i>Diplomacy Digest</i> for years and being 
one of the foremost students of wacky and devious strategies for
winning Dip games for those with no scruples.
We'd like to know how Mark is doing and catch up with him, so 
go to it!

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com or johnh of fiendishgames.demon.co.uk

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

suspended the Boasters! game.
I think this game will benefit from the break.

Dirk Fischbach (Italy)

<p>
Dave Partridge (Russia)

<p>
Egbert Ferreira (Turkey)

<p>
Dirk's Italy is taking advantage of Charles' France and his petulance.
David's Germany is playing a very delicate balance of power game while
Lee's replacement England (for the infamous Toby Harris) has been the
measured voice of calm.  A late forming RT between David and Egbert
has Jon in mucho trouble at the present moment.  Still, it looks like
France might be the first country out.
Check it out and join the <i>TAP</i> rooters for our own David Partridge!!

You can see how our very own Paul Rauterberg was screwed over by former

Speaking of Brits, I feel more connected to the Brit hobby these days than

I plan to vote and you can too by sending an E-Mail to Ryk at Ryk of Downes.com
and note that the Brits have separate votes for ALL PBM zines AND for those
with significant devotion to Diplomacy.
With E-Mail I've been noting lots more Americans participating in the Brit

As an added attraction this year, the web pages are in a separate poll.

The Canadian Championships will be held in Calgary January 5-7.
I have booked my flights from San Francisco and they are rather inexpensive at 
$US286 round trip (direct flight even!)
The Canadians are doing everything they can to assist in out of towners 
including some limited amount of hosting at local player's homes, 
the best way to meet the local players.

<p>
Calgary has been very isolated from the mainstream face to face hobby and 
they made a major effort to come to the Baltimore World DipCon X last August 
and I think we should make a major effort to reach out in response.

<p>
I look forward to seeing other hobby travelers turn up at Calgary 
so we can build more ties between this far flung and fascinating hobby we all share.

Hasbro Interactive (the folks who put out the Diplomacy computer game) has been 
sold to Inforgames of France.
I have been in contact with both companies and currently no one knows for sure 
what it means for the hobby.
The best indications at the moment is that for the short term nothing will change.
Diplomacy does appear to be in the titles sold but only the CD game.
As Hasbro does not have the source code of the game and company that developed 
it for Hasbro went out of buisness and the code is `gone' the only 
approach would seem to be to redo Diplomacy in total.  
Considering the sales of the CD game that is probably not
going to happen so the hobby will be supported via the Board Game 
side which still remains in Hasbro USA.

<p>
We have gotten some new people and contacts through the Hasbro web sites and 
expect this to be continued via Inforgames as soon as they
settle down on what they are doing in detail, which will take several months.

<i>((Well, that closes the curtain on what must be said to be one of the
hobby's biggest all-time fiascos!
The Computer Game product was a dog from day 1.
This shows the danger of subcontracting to neophytes.
It is possible that something will be resurrected from this, but most
likely it means that the Judges and their related progenitors are
going to dominate play of Diplomacy on the Internet.
And the rest of us, will likely not be affected at all.
Oh well, parts of the graphics of the Computer Game product looked
promising, but under the time pressures they had and the talent that
Hasbro turned the job over to, it was doomed from the start.
Here's to hoping that the next try will have more intellectual support
from our hobby that is needed to supply it.
I am not one who thinks that Artificial Intelligence play of Diplomacy
is possible, at least until a more general AI problem of mimicking the
human brain is solved, but the Hasbro Interactive product even underwhelmed
me for incompetence!))</i>

Fifty-two days to DipCon Denver...

<p>
DipCon XXXIV (the North American Diplomacy Championship) is coming soon!
Less than eight weeks from now (from 16-18 February), you should be in
Denver watching your back and making other people watch theirs!  If you
haven't yet told me (at manus of diplom.org) that you will be, what can
possibly be stopping you???

<p>
It can't be that pre-registration hasn't started yet, because it has.
GenghisCon (the host convention) is the largest gaming convention in the Rocky
Mountain area - something for everyone and a big hit with all the out-of-area
attendees of last year.  You can pre-register for Genghis and the included
DipCon at:
http://www.denvergamers.com

<p>
The cost is forty dollars.

<p>
So that can't be it.      

<p>
It certainly can't be a shortage of information.  You can get most anything
you need to know at the Website for the Association of Rocky Mountain Area
Diplomacy Adversaries (ARMADA):

<p>
http://www.diplom.org/armada

<p>
And what you can't get, you can get from me by mailing manus of diplom.org.

<p>
So that can't be it.

<p>
It can't be because you don't know where to stay.  You can request the special
GenghisCon rate of only seventy-nine dollars per night (occupancy limited only
by your own comfort :-) when you get in contact directly with the hotel at
this address:
http://denver.hyatt.com/denve

<p>
If you want or need to make other arrangements, let me know and I'll see
how the ARMADA can help.

<p>
So that can't be it.

<p>
It can't be that you can't get an airline seat.  Book now for the best
possible rates during ski season!  A number of attendees have had luck
arranging airfare through priceline.com and qixo.com, saving up to one    
hundred and fifty dollars over the prices quoted by the airlines!

<p>
So that can't be it.

<p>
It can't be that you don't know how to get from the airport to the event.
Just say the word and an ARMADA member will be at the airport to pick you up.

<p>
So that can't be it.

<p>
So I really can't think of a single reason (short of scheduled to become a
parent on or about that weekend - hi, Bruce!) why everyone reading this mail
isn't on my list of definite DipCon attendees.  A lot of people ARE on the
list, though!  Here's just a quick list of ten, taken from the top of my head:

<p>
  David Hood:        DixieCon director, past DipCon winner.

<p>
  Edi Birsan:        Last year's winner, inventor of the Lepanto, etc., etc.

<p>
  Mike Hall:         Third-place last year, down from Canada.

<p>
  Chris Martin:      4th-place last year, 1998 World Champion, 1999 Grand Prix.

<p>
  Yarden Livnat:     Sixth at the World Championship, current ARMADA champion.

<p>
  Tom Kobrin:        Yeah!  He won the negotiation with his wife!

<p>
  Rick Desper:       You know, Rick Desper.  Of PBEM fame.

<p>
  Larry Peery:       Long-time DW publisher, hobby legend.

<p>
  Buz Eddy:          ADR maintainer, will present the 2000 Grand Prix.  

<p>
  Matt Shields:      Current ADR leader, 3rd at the World Championship.

<p>
Put yourself on the same list as these people and a whole lot more.  Mail me
with the happy news that you'll be attending DipCon XXXIV - the only DipCon
ever to have the same Roman numeral as the number of SC's on the Diplomacy
board!

Hey Jim-Bob,

<p>
Since I never write anything, I thought I'd mention that I thought of you
the other day when I was moving/reorganizing my CDs (recently bought a much
larger CD bookshelf thing) and came across my old Close Lobsters CDs which I
haven't listened to since about 1992.  That in turn got me thinking about
the Housemartins, which reminded me to tell you that you should pick up the
new Beautiful South album, <i>Painting it Red.</i>  It's no <i>Quench,</i> but it's
pretty good and has a bit of a new sound to it.  Zarse loves it, but he
loves anything that's got Heaton in it.  He (Zarse) and I saw the band last
month on their tour supporting the new album, and the show was excellent
even though Jackie Abbott had a sore throat and had to stay behind at the
hotel.  The highlight of the show was Dave Hemingway taking Jackie's place
opposite Paul on vocals in ``Perfect 10," prompting Dave to preface the song
with the statement, ``for this song, just pretend I'm gay."

<p>
That's all far more info than you probably need.

I recently heard my first live music since the Ithaca Festival (of which
I don't think my music notes made print)...  
<i>((My error, see below....))</i>

<p>
WALKIN' JIM STOLTZ.  Lives
near Big Sky, Montana, just west of Yellowstone.  Walks all summer, a
thousand miles a year, packing a little trail guitar, singing and
composing songs of the trails and the Earth.  Plays little concerts
moving from town to town in fall and winter to earn a living.  A
slideshow of his photos was played during his music.  Some were from
trails I've hiked in Yellowstone, the Tetons, the Beartooth Mountains,
and Canyonlands.  Great pictures that give an idea why some of us love
it.  Several CDs out; I bought <i>Oh, What A Life</i> (1997, Wild Wind
Records, Big Sky).  For a grin here are some of the lyrics to ``The Food
Chain Song":
``A little butterfly, she is so neat, with her fancy wings and her dainty
feet,
Oh, she flutters here and there just like a queen, and if you saw her
there, you know what I mean,
And no one can replace her, no no no, she's the most special creature
flying under the sun,
But then you think about the food chain, and along comes a hungry crow:
chomp chomp chomp, gobble gobble gobble, gulp gulp gulp, she's gone."
(then similar verses with ``fawn"/``coyote" and ``hiker man"/``griz"...)
``Fat or skinny, short or tall, you don't have to worry at all,
You don't have to be dressed in style to get a taste or get tasted by
the wild,
Just think about the food chain, and along comes something bigger,
Chomp chomp chomp, gobble gobble gobble, gulp gulp gulp, you're gone!"

The part of the Ithaca Festival I attended was nice - Sunday 3-8 pm -
except for parking.  Walked a mile up Fall Drive to Stewart Park.  Met
Leaf at the pavilion, she was later than I was.  She's one of my loved
ones from Yellowstone, now living in Hawaii but visiting grandparents in
Dryden.  Her parents were married at the Haunt and she grew up in
Ithaca.  Also met her new (Feb 14 2000) baby daughter Lotus.  We heard
bits of a few bands and a lot of a drum circle.  Way brief reviews:

<p>
- The Ithaca Ageless Jazz Band (20 or so players, mostly horns, behind
the pavilion facing Cayuga Lake) played mainstream standards.
Technically okay, not real tight; but they definitely lacked the zip to
make it sound lively instead of like an AM car radio.

<p>
- Fe Nunn (5 players, diverse instruments, all acoustic out in the open)
had a really neat sound that I didn't analyze enough to describe.  I
just enjoyed it.  I think they're Navajo and I think some of their
instruments are as well.  It wasn't very much like anything else I've
heard.  Long instrumental jams, no vocals in the pieces I heard while
trying to find Leaf at the first gig I mentioned.  I'd like to hear
more.

<p>
- A couple of unexciting bands on the big soundstage with plenty of
amplification.  Unimpressed with most of the song selection and
execution.  We mostly didn't stay long in this area.

<p>
- A drum circle that was going almost all afternoon in a more open part
of the park.  Five to ten hand drums such as congas, frequently a
dancing crowd of five to ten more people including kids, and fifty to a
hundred people hanging around listening.  This was always fun.  The
dynamic highlight was when a woman taught a couple of other people (in
series, not in parallel) a two-person freeform dance where each person
has two drumsticks.  They fight a mock battle, whacking each other's
drumsticks and wheeling roundhouse kicks over each other's heads in time
with the drum circle's beat.  It was fun.  (Presumably with three or
more people you'd have to seriously choreograph and practice to avoid
smacking and hurting each other.)  The beauty of this dance is that it
can be spontaneous as each picks up on whatever the other starts and
does the same.  It was much like a martial art demonstration.  Someone
also brought a couple of didjiridoos (sp?) but I didn't hear one played
enough to form an opinion whether it's as weirdly affecting as some
recordings would suggest.

<p>
Elsewhere in the park, the stiltwalkers (who were completely apolitical
in the Saturday parade) put on a ``passion play" (because ``we're
passionate about what we're talking about") featuring Buttermilk Falls
and The Forest battling Big Box Store who threatens to overrun the
former Southwest Park, ruin the view from the Buttermilk Falls gorge
trail, and create a potential disaster on a flood plain.

<p>
A good time.  Would you believe this is my first live music of 2000?
Jeez.

I don't know how many of you have heard of ``The Cuckoo Egg Project", but I
just read bout it today for the first time. It has been going on for a few
days now on Napster. A  Self proclaimed indie artist (Stephanie Fix) has
been taking upon herself to foil the Napster community by pirating songs and
then altering them. They sound normal for a few seconds and then either turn
to silence or play an annoying Cuckoo bird sound or some other nasty thing
(Sometimes they have even replaced the song with one of Stephanie Fix's own
songs and then mislabel it as something more popular). I personally find
this heinous and terrible, mainly because by pirating and altering other
artist songs I think they are doing far more damage than simply stealing the
music in the first place! Whiny bastard like Metallica and Everclear (who I
am a fan of, but I personally dislike them for their anti-Napster views)
don't seem to realize that they are 1:) just making more publicity for
Napster, 2:) what they are doing to other artist music is worse than just
stealing it, and 3:) I thought the whole point of the indie-music scene was
to avoid entities like the RIAA, not pander to their whims and profits.

though one thing that I did read in the above articles was about the

the song, but who knows?

Well, another season has come and gone, and I'm betting on the Yankees to
win again next year.  How 'bout you?  Per your recommendation, here's a
little ditty I wrote to remind us all of how Baseball is, and will be for
some time.  Apologies to Lennon &amp; McCartney:

<p>
The baseball teams all say they want to win,

<p>
But most have lost before the season begins,

<p>
There's nothing that they'll say, but they've learned how to play the game,

<p>
It's easy...

<p>
The better players go for the bigger bucks,

<p>
Which only some teams have, and I think it sucks,

<p>
If you want to win today there's only one way to do it,

<p>
It's easy,

<p>
<p>All you need is cash; All you need is cash,

<p>
All you need is cash, cash; Cash is all you need.

<p>
<p>The Dodgers and the Mets, the Braves and Yanks,

<p>
All send Commish Bud Selig many thanks,

<p>
They buy up all the players, and win another crown,

<p>
It's easy...

<p>
<p>All you need is cash; All you need is cash,

<p>
All you need is cash, cash; Cash is all you need.

<p>Hey Jude, if you want to join this Fool on the Hill and his Revolution, just
take the Long and Winding Road.  My socialist solution may have originated
from Back in the USSR, but I bet it can get by With a Little Help from My

can win a World Series today, and those teams on Penny Lane struggle for
mediocrity.

<i>((I'm really terrible at this sort of thing, but it really needs

<p>
``filk"?

<p>
``The Rutles", a Beatles parody dreamed up by Eric Idle of Monty Python fame
beat me to ``All You Need Is Cash".  I don't remember if they released a song
by that or just a fake album cover, and I can't read the small print
on my CD to tell me.

<p>
<i>((There's a recorded song.....
That type of parody (putting new related words to an old song) is 
called a filk.  I remember the Rutles but had forgotten that they
did that.  We would want to change the words to be more baseball 
oriented.
The Yankees are talking about signing A-Rod and putting him at 3rd!
And if they don't how much you want to bet that the Mets get him!
And Cleveland loses Manny Ramirez to the Yanks nearly for sure....
hey what, I'm making YOUR argument.... whasup???))</i>
 
<p>
ESPN's Peter Gammons says that the Mets get A-Rod.  I was driving back from
Ohio yesterday and heard him on the radio for about 10 minutes talking about
all the free agents out there and where they might go.  He never mentioned
the Twins once.  Go figure.
 
<p>
<i>((And Peter is the God.  That's where I think A-Rod goes too, but expect
the Yankees to make a run just to keep him away from the Mets.
[[new add, shows what great prognosticators WE are....]]

<p>
((Will all of the other teams have to band together and collude behind
an ``anointed one" to defeat the NY teams??))</i>

<p>
That's an interesting and very ugly thought.
 
<p>
<i>((But possible.))</i>

<p>
How so?  Will all the other AL owners (or a significant majority of them)
meet in a room and decide which games get thrown to what teams, just to make
sure the Yankees have a worse record than someone and don't make the
playoffs?  Or will they all decide to deal all their good players and enough
money to finance them to one team so that the Yankees have someone to
compete with them in the playoffs?  Yuk.

<p>
<i>((The latter, I would guess.  Believe me, it WILL happen if the Yankee
dominance goes on much longer.  Do you think the Detroit or KC GM
will have infinite patience???))</i>

<p>
Are you ticked off because I was right, or because you didn't see I was
right, or for some other reason?

<p>
<i>((I'm just ticked off because it somehow seems that the whole game has gone
up one more level.  I thought that there were about a dozen teams going
into this year that had a chance to get to the World Series and I didn't
really think that was so bad.  Admittedly teams like Montreal and
Milwaukee had NO chance of getting into that dozen, but teams like the
A's showed that there was a way....  but now I actually get the feeling
that these teams (Oak, SF, St. Louis, Chicago, Red Sox) at best are 
becoming playoff warm-ups to the main event.  I seriously think it is
likely that we will have another Subway Series next year.))</i>
 
<p>
It's been going this way since just before the last strike ('94).  The early
90s are where the salary escalation really took place, anything since is a
logical progression.  The good players want the good money, and there's only
a few teams that can give it to them.  Some other good players want to play
in October, so they negotiate with teams that can get them there...see
above.  Junior is the lone exception, but I'll still take his paycheck for a
month and take the next 10 years off too.  But the Reds are strapped for
cash for a while, so he doesn't have much to help him.
 
<p>
<i>((Yeah, but Junior has to be Junior first.  I think the Reds would have
given St. Louis a run if Junior had had a better year.))</i>

So it comes down to money.  The big market teams have it, and the small
market teams get publically financed stadiums to try to compete (Cincy's
opens in '02).  Might work for a couple of years, like the Marlin/Padre
plan, but then Steinbrenner will get some help either from NYC itself or a
corporate partner and the Yankees will have a $250M payroll.

Actually, that's kinda frightening to see in print.

<p>
<i>((Go for it.... 
You know, the likelihoods are increasing that there will be NO BASEBALL
played in 2002.  The Player Contract is up and that is the only chance

<p>
I wouldn't say it's the *only* chance.  The 82nd Airborne could always drop
in on MLB headquarters.
 
<p>
<i>((Unlikely, they don't defend against invasions of the US any more ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
I don't really see any ``meaningful" change happening.  Do you think that
Fehr will agree to *any* kind of cap, let alone a hard one?  Do you think
the owners will agree to any large-scale revenue sharing?  I expect they'll
make noise, pass some small concessions, but no real reform.  And in 2005
the Yankees will have a $250M payroll while the Royals and Twins won't have
a $25M payroll combined.  Bet?

<p>
<i>((If they lose the ENTIRE season and the playoffs (and according to the
people who know like Peter Gammons, that is what the owners are
working on), so they lose an entire year of salaries (and it will take
that) I bet you're wrong.  If the owners give in again and don't agree
to lose the entire year of 2002 for baseball, then I agree with you.
Is that the bet you want to take??))</i>

<p>
Yep.  For the reason that the owners will give in again.  They always do.
I'm not real sure why, because they don't let me audit their books.

<p>
<i>((Steinbrenner is supposedly pissed at the other owners that they don't
negotiate harder for better radio-TV deals.  He agrees that they will
never equal his deal for the Yankees, but he thinks they can all make
20-40% more than they do.  That doesn't solve the problem, but it 
does suggest that the solution will include NATIONAL-LOCAL TV deals,
using the satellites/cable/Internet to make all games more available
at the ``right" price for MLB, rather than the present hodge-podge of
individual deals.))</i>

<p>
It's all well and good for Mr. Steinbrenner to upbraid everyone else for not
getting enough money out of their teams, but I still don't think that the
Expos are going to be able to catch up unless they loot the Quebec treasury
(or maybe Northern Virginia's).  Essentially it's George saying, ``look, I'm
playing by the same rules that you are and *I* can make it work".  Sorry.
Same world, different planet.  I don't think that the Twins are going to get
a lot of money even if they get a cable TV deal for all of MN, IA, SD, ND,
and MT.

<p>
MLB has been granted an antitrust exemption by Congress.  It's time to make
them earn it.  They're 1 company with 30 divisions.  I want someone besides

Today's paper says that the idea of eliminating teams from MLB is making the
rounds, possibly as a bargaining chip by the owners against the Player's

teams from the current 30, with the teams most often mentioned being
Minnesota, Montreal, Kansas City, Tampa Bay (didn't they just come in?), and
Florida (didn't THEY also just come in?...AND win the last non-Yankee WS?).

Ok, so Ramirez signs for $21M/yr, for 12 years.
I guess $21M doesn't really buy that much anymore.  You can only get one

<p>
The USSC Justices pretty much behaved according to form.

<p>
Justice Thomas, consistent with his view that oral arguments are a useless
artifact of a bygone era, didn't ask a single question.

<p>
Justice Scalia, consistent with his adopted role of the reincarnation of the
spirit of Hugo Black, asserted that, read literally, the Florida statutes
had no ambiguity, and therefore required no interpretation. Amusingly, he
also turned this argument against Olson vis a vis his reading of federal
statutes, and Olson replied that he didn't think that ``parts of the
statutory scheme should be read in isolation from the whole". That, of
course, is precisely what Olson would have the Court do vis a vis the
Florida election laws. Oops. Your slip is showing.

<p>
Justice O'Connor, consistent with her views on judicial restraint,
questioned the jurisdiction for the USSC reviewing this case at all. Though
O'Connor has often had her way by holding out for the narrowest possible
ruling, it doesn't look like she enjoys the support of her fellow
conservatives, who are her traditional constituency in arguing for
exercising judicial restraint.

<p>
Souter, as is his wont, tended toward professorial hypotheticals. It appears
that Souter is receptive to the argument O'Connor pursued that the USSC has
no business deciding this case.

<p>
Kennedy and Rehnquist were hard on the Dems and easy on the Reps, while
Ginsburg was hard on the Reps and easy on the Dems. Both Kennedy and
Rehnquist were extremely agressive in their questioning of Tribe. Tribe, in
fact, lost broad chunks of his time to argument between justices that didn't
involve him.

<p>
Ginsburg displayed the greatest sensitivity to the Republicans attacks on
the legitimacy of the FSC opinion. At one point, Bush attorney Ted Olson,
caught up in the spirit of his political views, described the FSC as ``bound
and determined to reach a predetermined result" and Ginsburg interrupted him
and basically cut him off at the knees. She had no desire to listen to that
kind of assertion. Olson then had to backpedal furiously from this temporary
lapse into spinmeistering before he could continue with a genuine legal
argument.

<p>
Stevens was hard on everyone. He loves to bust chops in oral argument, but
then writes opinions that address completely separate issues.

<p>
The most unfortunate aspect of yesterday's oral argument is that the lion's
share of time with Olson and Tribe was spent on the issue of the USSC's
jurisdiction in this case. But only O'Connor and Souter pursued that issue,
and Rehnquist and Kennedy defended it with equal vigor. Thomas is a
candidate for a third justice who might be inclined to rule on the basis of
lack of jurisdiction, but it's hard to see the USSC taking this case, only
to make a statement that they can't decide it. No other justice seemed
inclined to make a ruling on this point.

<p>
That leaves precious little other material in this oral argument from which
to divine how the USSC is inclined to rule. Scalia was the only Justice who
levelled a direct attack on the substance of the FSC opinion, which he saved
for Tribe's time. His attack elicited an animated defense from Souter and
one of the few instances in which Breyer jumped in with qestions. Stevens
and Ginsburg then leapt into the fray. So for a good 10-15 minutes of
Tribe's time, the Justices spent their questions arguing with each other
about the merits of the FSC case. In that dynamic, Scalia and Stevens
appeared to be on the attack and Souter and Ginsburg on the defense.
Breyer's professorial hypotheticals were, as usual, inscrutable.

<p>
The only thing that was clear to me was that most justices seemed to assume
the correctness of the Tribe brief's view that 3 U.S.C. 5 is a ``safe harbor"
and not a mandate. So it appears that, if the Republicans are to win this
appeal, it's going to have to be on Article II grounds, not federal
statutory grounds. This is illustrated by the fact that Scalia pushed
Article II arguments exclusively in his contentious questioning of Tribe.

<p>
Summary: 2 justices seemed to defend the FSC; 2 seemed to attack it; 4 spoke
nearly exclusively on the subject of the Court's jurisdiction-split 2/2 on
that issue; 1 justice spoke not a word, but went straight to his work . . .

transcript (available at cnn.com) shows that they really ripped

and O'Connor also had tough questions for Tribe as to why the
Court moved the certification deadline.

My ``opinion":

<p>
Carl Bernstein is on Larry King tonight, serving as a very visible
reminder that a party which thinks it is getting away with something
has to be very careful.  As he says, in the next couple years, you
are going to see some very detailed exposes of all of the things
which have happened in the past few weeks.  He, of all people, should
know.

<p>
Dick Cheney was, of course, on Larry King tonight, talking about
how the number of votes lost in Miami-Dade county was not terribly
unusual.  The attitude ``sure, there were 10,000 votes marked
as `no vote' for the Presidency, but that kind of thing happens
all the time".  All of the Republicans' arguments are missing a
circuit here or there.  They are blithely ignoring the closeness of
the race, and trying to pretend that things should be treated as
"business as usual".  Sure, nobody would blink if 10,000 votes
were left uncounted, if the winner took the state by 45,000 votes,
as normally would be the case.

<p>
The news media is taking itself entirely too seriously during the
past few weeks.  You think they would have learned their lesson
on Election Night.  But they are covering the whole process with
Gore as though the election had not already happened.  Gore has
watched Clinton and learned: in a situation like this, it is far
more important to be on sound legal ground than to be winning the
PR war.  

<p>
Something Bush supporters should think about: do they think that
Bush would have ``won" the vote certification had Katherine Harris
(or a similar stooge) not been acting as SoS, using all of her
power to short-circuit the recount process?  ``Death of Outrage" is
a favorite Republican term.  Where is the outrage now?  They have
invented the idea that machine recounts are more accurate than hand
recounts, that hand recounts can only be done if the machine is
broken, that hand recounts MUST be done within a week (an idea which
was true between the years of 1951 and 1979, but hasn't been true
for more than 20 years), etc. etc.  

<p>
I seem to recall, as a child, that the fundamental value of any
democratic system was the importance of accurately counting the
votes.
But, as soon as the Bush team saw the results, they decided to do
everything in their power to AVOID an accurate counting of the votes.
Rather than using their power to ensure that there are orderly,
accurate counts, they have taken every step to smear the Democrats.
Basically, they are saying ``we cannot trust the Democrats to do a
recount without cheating, so we're going to stop them".  

<p>
So now, I am part of the underprivileged.  I am part of a set of
people not trusted to accurately and honorably count votes.  

<p>
A reading of the Florida Supreme Court's decision of last week is
quite interesting.  It would be very interesting if the media,
instead of swallowing all the explanations being spoon-fed to them,
would instead read this decision and look very closely at it.  

<p>
So many people are getting into the idea that the election process
is a team sport.  They think it is legitimate for the Republicans
to use all of their powers to stop the Democrats, and vice versa.
This is really short-sighted thinking.  People wonder why
Generation X and younger people don't vote.  It's because, when we
were children, our formative experience with the American government
was either the Vietman war or Nixon's resignation.  

<p>
Two days after the election, or maybe three, Gore made a simple
request: a hand recount of the four counties: Volusia, Miami-Dade,
Palm Beach, and Broward.  Here it is, three weeks later, and these
recounts are not done.  Why not?  Well, the answer is obvious.  If
they are all done, fairly and accurately, Bush will lose.  Both
sides know this.  The fact that Bush has ignored this, and has chosen
instead to try to steal the White House, should serve as clear
evidence that the man has no ``moral authority".

<p>
This is not something that people will forget.  People talk about
``the country needs to heal", but, as we all know, a bullet wound
cannot heal properly until the bullet is removed.  What does this
mean?  A lot of people are going to be really angry for a long time
if those recounts are simply suppressed.

<p>
<i>((I'd really like to publish this in <b>TAP</b>, and hope you sent it to
me for that reason.  I entirely agree with it and actually think
that Gore may well still be President before this all is over.))</i>

<p>
Yeah, that would be fine.  I think the odds are good that Gore
would be awarded a victory by the Florida courts.  Then, if the
Florida legislature tries to do something to negate the court, you
will see more outrage than you could imagine.  On the other side,
since so many Republicans have believed all the propaganda, they
would not be happy at all with a Gore presidency.  One poll suggests
that Democrats would be more accepting of a Bush presidency than
Republicans of a Gore presidency.  I believe this poll, but take it
more as a sign of the intolerance of the Republicans.  After all,
their agenda for the past 8 years has be to attack Clinton at every
opportunity.  

<p>
<i>((You saw my exchange with Paul on r.g.d, the Supreme Court is 
going to READ THE BUSH TEAM THE RIOT ACT on Friday.  They will
be blistering once they get hit by ``so-called Republicans".
The USSC knows that it is fighting for its credibility in
history and the world, something the media doesn't seem to
care about.

<p>
[Note how wrong that was..... ;-)  ]))</i>

<p>
The most amusing thing about the Court case is how clueless the media
are.  The buzz among the talking heads is that, since 7 of the
justices were appointed by Republicans, and since they agreed to hear
this case, they might be ruling in favor of Bush.  I have read
through the Florida ruling - it seems pretty sound to me.  There is
no way that the Bush cause will win, the question only is what form
the USSC will use to support the FSC.  I imagine they will make it
very clear to everybody that the judiciary does in fact have not only
the power but the responsibility to review laws and to resolve
disputes when
two laws contradict each other.  Hopefully they will say something
about the rhetoric about how the Court ``legislated", but they might
not want to embarrass Bush too much.

<p>
At least some conservative partisans are beginning to see that they are,
indeed, in the briar patch now.

<p>
There is probably no more deeply conservative set of editorial pages in this
nation than the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ is now urging Bush, via that
editorial page to withdraw his appeal to the USSC.

<p>
Why in the world is the WSJ doing that? Because the WSJ is looking at the
USSC questions for review the same way I am, i.e. that the USSC wants to
take this opportunity to defend the legitimacy of judicial review against
the Bush frontal attack on same.

<p>
But Bush won the battle to hold off enough of the recount by the deadline,
so why should Bush and the WSJ care, even if the USSC upholds the FSC case?
Isn't the point moot?

<p>
Nope. Litigation is getting under way in two different Florida counties on
the subject of absentee ballot fraud allegations against Republicans. The
litigation in Seminole County is especially fraught with danger for Bush.
The evidence there is pretty solid that the Republican-controlled canvassing
board allowed Republican Party members to handle, unsupervised, some 4,700
ballots of registered Republicans for the express purpose of fixing those
ballots' failure to meet the technical requirements of election law
pertaining to absentee ballots. This would be directly contrary to numerous
election laws on the books designed to prevent voter fraud. Republicans are
growing increasingly concerned that (i) they will be unable to convince the
trial judge to delay the trial past Dec. 12th; and (ii) the allegations are
provable.

<p>
The remedy being sought is for the court to throw out *all* the absentee
ballots from Seminole County. There is solid judicial precedent for this, as
this is exactly the remedy that was ordered in Miami's most recent mayoral
election, when the absentee ballots were similarly tainted by voter fraud.
If that is done, there would be a 5,000 vote swing in favor of Gore in
Florida.

<p>
So what happens to Bush if (i) the USSC upholds the FSC, taking the moment
to make a strong statement about the legitimate role of state courts in
construing state election laws; and (ii) Florida courts throw out the
Seminole County absentee ballots before the final deadline for certifying
Electors? Would Jeb Bush and the Florida legislature be willing to defy the
United States Supreme Court and certify GWB's Electors anyway? And would
Congress go along with ignoring the nation's highest court? And how would
the public react? For that matter, where stands the Republic, if the
nation's highest office-holders feel justified in ignoring the nation's
highest court?

<p>
The WSJ doesn't want to know the answer to those questions. It is urging
Bush to withdraw his appeal to the USSC before these events can come about,
returning the battleground for ignoring courts and accepting Electors to the
Republican-controlled Florida Legislature, Florida Governor and US Congress.
They'd prefer to keep this a purely political battle, and keep the USSC out
of it.

<p>
Yep, just like old Billy said, when plotting the illegitimate overthrow of
the government: ``The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers." Or, at
the very least, withdraw the appeal and keep them out of the loop.

<p>
This thing might just rise to the level of that ``constitutional crisis"
media-hype yet.

<p>
CNN has them available.  I made one error
with regard to the timing of the revision of the Florida statute (it
was in 1989, not 1979) in my letter to you yesterday.  
The Republican brief is a mishmash of irrelevant facts without any direct
line of argumentation.  The Democratic brief has a clear line of argumentation 
which looks convincing to me.  (Call it bias, if you will, but following a chain 
of logic is nothing subject to bias, which is something I have been trying 
unsuccessfully to argue on r.g.d.)

<p>
My favorite nugget: as early as 1868 we saw the Florida Supreme Court 
instructing the State Canvassing Board to include results from counties that
had previously been excluded.  :)  Talk about an established precedent!

<p>
I'm finding the election far more interesting than my work.  Maybe I should 
switch fields.  

<p>
Long Live Hunter S. Thompson:
Now that he's got a column at ESPN.com, I can't get enough!

<p>
The latest quote:
``And we wonder why the Election turned out so weird. The Pollsters
knew nothing, because the people they talked to lied to them. Nobody
wants to talk to a Pollster, anyway. They are Vermin. And they are
getting paid to harass you with questions, but you're not getting a
dime for it. You're not even getting on TV."

<p>
This is what I'd been feeling - that a lot of people, when polled,
said they would vote for Nader, because they wanted to see Nader
getting good numbers in the polls.  But when election day came, a lot
of these people realized the futility and danger of this approach,
and reverted to Gore.  I see no other explanation for a Gore victory
when he was trailing in every major poll, many by 3 percentage points or
more, during the week before the election.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Robin Walters (Mon, 11 Dec 2000 04:15:35 GMT)</b>

<p>
I have (another) question:
Am I correct in thinking that, on the argument put forward by the Bush
camp (that the recounts are unconstitutional because they give different
treatments to different votes due to &#252;nstandardised" methods of assessment), 
the entire Florida ballot was unconstitutional?

<p>
<b>Rick Desper:</b>
One has to wonder how they could give the same treatments to all the
counties, as there are different machines and ballots used in different
places.  In any case, the FSC simply could not have tried to impose a
uniform standard, as <i>that</i> would have been ``legislating from the
bench".  Basically, on this issue, the Bush camp is taking a ``damned if
you do and damned if you don't" stance.
The Gore brief gives ample argument to support the ``intent of the voter"
standard.

<p>
<i>((This would be a ``reasonable argument", but that does not make it
correct.
Given US law and tradition, the local ballots can be different.  Thus,
the Bush camp would argue TWO things and both do have some reasonable
level of veracity (and I wish that's what the courts were really
considering):))</i>

<p>
<b>Rick breaks in before my two things:</b>
No, what the Bush camp is simply doing is starting from the result
they desire, add the perceived logic of Scalia et al., and simply
trying to assert that their case has merit.  They throw in a lot of
insults of the FSC for unknown reason.  They complain that the FSC did
not make any reference to the decision handed down by the USSC last
week to vacate the previous FSC order.  This type of sentence is only
written for ignorant voters.   The reason the FSC did not make any
reference to the USSC ``decision" is quite simple - it doesn't exist.
While the networks have been missing this point all week, the fact
remains that the USSC did not ``rule against" Gore, they merely vacated a
decision.  Apparently the FSC has decided that, since Bush won the
certified vote and we are now in a contest, that there is no reason to
go back to the first decision, as the protest proceedings would
supercede any result in the first case.

<p>
<i>((1) All votes in each county should be treated precisely the same and
the machine count is the most fair way to do this.))</i>

<p>
<b>Rick Responds:</b>
Well, see, that's not really fair.  We know that the machines in the
South have a much higher error rate.  I would contend that anything
short of a statewide manual recount (of the undervote, in this case)
would constitute a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

<p>
<i>((2) Since Florida votes as a state in the EC, no county should be
treated differently (i.e. with an unstandardized method of
assessment).))</i>

<p>
<i>((Rick Desper again:</i>
Other than ``voter intent", there is no way to have a standardized method
of assessment.  If the USSC wants to strike down ``voter intent"
(a) they would declare as unconstitutional a large number of election
laws in the US;
(b) they sure picked a hell of a time to do so.
If the USSC really insists on uniform standards, then I would contend
that the entire election was unconstitutional.  After all, <i>in every
single state</i>, there was a lack of uniform standards.
The Court could not conceivably take this step.

<p>
<b>Finally Back to Robin:</b>
It seems that every county had a different ballot, with a range of methods
of registering a vote and different equipment for recording votes, resulting
in massively varying error rates from county to county.  If that isn't
guaranteed to give unequal treatment to different voters, I don't know what is.  
I think that in order to comply with GOP demands for ``standardised" counting of
votes, the only conceivable remedies are (i) that all 6m votes be counted by
hand; (ii) a statewide revote on a standardised ballot counted on a single
machine type; (iii) annulment of the Florida election.

<p>
<i>((And, of course all three are completely off the table, so we are
talking about a series of ``evil" second or third bests.))</i>

<p>
<b>Rick Desper:</b>
The Gore side argues, convincingly, IMHO, that there is no reason to
do a hand recount of the votes already detected by the machines.
Furthermore, long-established Florida law states that it is proper
for the court during the contest phase to do an examination of a subset
of the ballots.

<p>
<b>And Robin finishing up:</b>
Of course, in reality the Bush argument is baloney.  Apart from anything else,
the FSC stated very clearly that the basis for judging a vote was that in
Florida statute.  It may not be explicit (e.g. do/do not count pregnant
chads), but it nevertheless is clear.

<b>Rick Desper:</b>
And, as you might imagine, the Gore brief was quite happy to cite
the Texas statute in their brief.  I think the Gore side is getting
tired of the rampant hypocrisy and inconsistency from the Bush side.

<p>
<i>((Since Republicans and Democrats watching the count need to agree.
There still will be disputed ballots after that process.  
I wish we had been at the point we are today a month ago with this

I'm not sure the other two ever would have been considered.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper:</b>

<p>
In retrospect, Gore would have been better off demanding a statewide
hand recount from the start.  Of course, he was within his rights to do
as he wanted to, but it would have saved some time in terms of the
frivolous arguments he would have had to deal with.

<p>
I think Hunter S. Thompson is right.  The Fix is in.  It's the
VRWC, just like Hillary said.

<p>
I think Tribe was simply astonished last time that Scalia was seriously
arguing that the Florida Constitution should not be considered as
grounds for an appellate ruling during a contest like this.  He has
had some time to think about this issue carefully.  His brief argues
(convincingly, IMHO) that there
a) there is no foundation for this argument under the case (MacPherson?)
that Scalia was citing
b) even if there was foundation for this argument, the FSC did not
rely upon anything other than statute and longstanding precedent
c) there is simply no way to argue that the legislature has ``plenary"
power which supercedes the state Constitution.  The state Constitution
and the state Legislature are inextricably intertwined.

<p>
The Tribe brief makes mention to a number of decisions written by
Kennedy and O'Connor.  My best guess?  You have four justices that
will definitely side with Gore: Souter, Breyer, Ginsburg, and Stevens.
You probably have two that will side with Bush: Scalia and Thomas
(though I will be <i>extremely</i> interested to see on what basis they
decide to do such a thing).  Likely Rehnquist will join them.  I think
that there is a reasonable likelihood that Kennedy and O'Connor voted
for the stay simply to freeze the process, figuring that the issues
had to be decided before the votes were counted, but that, given that
the FSC stuck to the path proscribed to them last week, they are
unlikely to rule for Bush.

<p>
A ruling for Bush, on the grounds they cite, would certainly inspire
chaos.
This ruling will go down with Marbury vs. Madison, Dred Scott,
Brown vs. Board of Education, Roe vs. Wade, etc.  I sure hope Scalia
doesn't find four more votes to embarrass this court for posterity.

<p><br><p><br><b>Paul Windsor (Mon, 11 Dec 2000 11:22:23 -0500 (EST))</b>

<p>
Two observations:

<p>
1. The ``voter intent" guideline, with specific standards to be established
by local canvassing boards, is the law established by the
Republican-controlled Florida state legislature.

<p>
The same Republicans who are now complaining that's a vague and
inconsisitent standard are the ones who wrote that standard into law. The
same Republicans who are complaining bitterly of the FSC's judicial activism
are also complaining that the FSC didn't rewrite their own laws to provide
the more precise guidelines that they wish they had written, but didn't.

<p>
Personally, I've grown tired of listening to the Republicans talk out of
both sides of their mouths on this one. You take the election laws in each
state as you find them. You don't walk away from trying to count votes
because a legislature did a crappy job of writing the guidelines. You do the
best you can and you sure as hell don't listen to the same people who wrote
the crappy law lecture you for trying to follow it.

<p>
And this is the same issue that Bush already lost in federal district court,
and on appeal to the 11th circuit, and which the USSC wouldn't even hear on
appeal from there, in his failed attempt to have courts declare the Florida
recount unconstitutional. To paraphrase: The Repbulicans lost this issue
once, they lost it again, and they lost it a third time. It's time for them
to give up for the good of the nation and admit that they've lost this
issue.

<p>
2. The idea that ``fairness" is only achieved by uniform standards is a
complete red herring.

<p>
We don't have uniform standards for voting in this country. In this past
election, there were eight different types of voting mechanisms in use
around the nation and countless hundreds of different ballot styles used for
those mechanisms. In Florida, alone, there were five different mechanisms
used: 1. Paper and pen ballots; 2. Scranton sheet style optiscan ballots; 3.
Connect-the-arrow optiscan ballots; 4. Levered ballot machines; and 5.
Punch-card machines. The rejected ballot rates for these mechanisms range
from 0.3% (levered machines) to 3% (punch cards). Some require hand counting
(pen and paper), some are easy to hand count (optiscans), some are
impossible to handcount (levered machines, which record the total votes on
mechanical dials inside the machine, but leave no other record), and then,
of course, there are the punch cards.

<p>
<i>((And some of those give ``instant feedback" on attempts to vote twice
(at least 3. connect the arrow and 4. levered machines).))</i>

<p>
If we accept the Republican complaint about different standards for counting
being so inherently unfair that we have to forbid people from even trying,
where exactly do we draw the line in that argument? If that argument forbids
hand counting punch cards, why doesn't it forbid hand counting pen and paper
ballots? Why doesn't it forbid the use of punch card readers entirely, since
their error rate is so much higher than other mechanisms? And what does that
say about a levered machine, that purportedly has the lowest error rate, but
is impossible to recount?

<p>
<i>((I still find it completely impossible to find anything in this argument
except partisan feelings.))</i>

<p>
It is insufficient to merely note that the standards are not uniform. The
argument is not valid unless that observation leads to a quantifiable
statement that the statistical reliability of the outcome is significantly
jeopardized by the lack of uniform standards.

<p>
<i>((Precisely, and I am a health economist who studies the quality of
issues like Paul's analogy and I think it's great!))</i>

<p>
Analogy time: The skill levels of thoracic surgeons are not uniform. Some
are better than others, and as a rule, a layperson is not in a position to
know which surgeon is better than which. But you suffer a heart attack, and
need an angioplasty to relieve the blockage in your coronary artery. Do you,
on the basis of knowing that not all surgeons are equally skilled and that
it is impossible for you to know whether your own surgeon has the highest
possible skill level, refuse to have any surgery at all? Of course not. Why
not? Because you know that: (i) the vast majority of thoracic surgeons in
this country operate at a high skill level; and (ii) the risk of trying to
live with a blocked artery far outweighs the likelihood of botched surgery.

<p>
<i>((And what people do is to use other information to infer this.  For
example, you might choose to wait for surgery for the physician that
is really busy doing this surgery and has a long wait time 
(and there is data on the web in  Australia that allows you to
do this directly), because he is the one with the most practice
and the most patients.  Patience is a virtue ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
What is missing from the Republicans' complaints about non-uniform standards
here is any meaningful analysis of the likelihood of botched surgery. They're
trying to scare the hell out of you with propaganda, but at the end of the
day, they don't have the evidence to demonstrate that their complaints
amount to a statistical probability of error greater than not counting. But
more importantly, at the end of the day, their argument is nothing less than
saying that you ought to have so little faith in the democratic process in
this country that you'd rather live with a crippled heart than take a chance
on the operating theater.

<p>
<i>((That's about it.
Even REALLY trying to do this about surgery in real life is hard and the
solution makes little sense.))</i>

<p>
Do people really feel that way about it? Is our faith in the system really
so small? 'Cause if it is, I'd say that we have a helluva lot bigger problem
in this country than trying to agree on a standard for hand counting punch
card ballots.

It's more the former than the latter. But it's a process that's been going
on in this country for about 20 years, beginning with Reagan's explicit
campaign promises about the kind of jurists he would promote to the bench.
This began the process of open and explicit political litmus testing of
judges. It's now something that's done on both sides. After 20 years of it,
the process of replacing the entirety of the federal bench with people whose
politics matter more than their skills is fairly mature. There aren't a lot
of judges around who were sworn to the bench before 1980.

<b>Robin Walters:</b>
If the FSC react in anything like the manner of Paul's legal circle, is it

<p>
You aren't the first person I've seen speculate on this point. Judges are
human beings too. Only time will tell.
But this is a good occasion to report a development in that the ``stealth
case" that I talked about before, the one seeking to toss out all absentee
ballots counted after 7:00pm on 11-7 because there is no Florida law written
by the legislature allowing that. There is only a court order (a consent
decree) and an administrative rule written to comply with it. The theory is
simple: if the USSC means what it says, that only the legislature writes
election rules, and that any change to them by the courts is unlawful, then
the rule allowing counting of late-arriving absentee ballots is void and any
ballots counted, which arrived after the polls closed, should be tossed.

<p>
I reported before that this case had been removed to federal court, but that
the federal judge was expected to issue a ruling in the case soon. He's
ruled. Not surprisingly, Judge Paul ruled for the defendant state officials.
The decision can be found at http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/ORDER.PDF and I
challenge anyone to reconcile it's reasoning with the Supreme Court's recent
decision and stay.
Judge Paul reasons that the administrative regulation allowing the counting
of late-arriving ballots ``was the product of the state executive branch, the
authorized representative of the state in a lawsuit against the state,
enacting a measure to bring the state into compliance with a federally
ordered mandate in a situation where the state legislature refused to do
so." Thus, according to the Court, ``the administrative rule should be
considered the equivalent of a federal court order detailing how a state
statute conflicts with a federal statute and setting out what must be done
about it. Thus, it is the statute which must yield when federal elections
are involved."

<p>
Sorry, but that doesn't pass the laugh test. There is no federal/state
supremacy conflict here. There is only a state court and a state law. And
the USSC has been quite emphatic on the point on two occasions during the
last week that state courts can't rewrite state election laws. Judge Paul's
rationalizations are just a bunch of beside-the-point gobledygook. And the
reasoning Judge Paul gives on why the case must remain in federal court
stinks. He states that the original complaint, which has since been amended
to remove all federal claims, must control. He does this despite the fact
that the Supreme Court emphatically disclaimed the so-called ``artful
pleading" rule a year and a half ago.

<p>
Anyone want to give me the odds on the USSC granting an immediate appeal in
this case to correct Judge Paul's reasoning on the role of courts in
construing election law?

<p>
It seems that the USSC is rejecting what I had feared worst, the idea that
the legislature in this issue was somehow ``unmoored" from judicial review.
It seems that the court is stuck on the lack of standards.  This is hardly
something they can blame on Gore, though, or on the FSC.  They have big
problems with the FSC moving the certification date, and with the FSC not
getting back to them about the vacated decision.  But they can hardly hold
their problems with the FSC against Gore.

<p>
It seems that the Court almost wants to declare the manual recount system
unconstitutional.  I don't think that this would be a very good idea.  To
say the least.  Yes, there are problems with the ``voter intent" standard,
but they cannot simply say that Gore has no right to contest the election,
because the law is poorly written.  

<p>
Kennedy, for one, seems to be deeply troubled by the lack of standards.
At one point, he says something to the effect that what they need is a law
saying what the standards are.  This is a nightmare for judicial
restraint, and a perfect example of a type of situation where the Judge
simply does not have the option of refusing to interpret the law.  

<p>
This ruling would have been a piece of cake for the Warren Court.  They
would have walked in, decided upon standards of their own, and told the
counters ``this is what you must do."  This is anathema to Scalia et al.
But what else can they do?

<p>
Are they, the champions of federalism and judicial restraint, simply going
to walk in and declare the FSC's interpretation of state law as invalid,
and leave it at that?  There really is no question that Gore has a right,
under Florida statute, to contest a set of ballots.  The only question is,
how?  Simply saying that there is no way to look at the ballots is
patently unacceptable.  I think even Scalia would concede that.

<p>
I think that it might take a while to get a ruling.  I think the reason
that the count was stayed was due to a majority disliking the fact that
the standards were so unequal.  But that does not, by itself, imply that
they are willing to simply terminate the count completely.  

<p>
I feel that, ultimately, even though this may be distasteful to the
conservative wing of the court, that they will proscribe standards for
counting votes, and tell the Florida Supreme Court to finish the recount.
Possibly they will ask that the counties which did recounts earlier also
be forced to join, if they really want total uniformity, then this step
would seem to be required.  Ultimately, they are treading onto very
untenable ground if they say that the recount cannot be done because of
a lack of uniform standards.  A lack of uniform standards is a fact of
life, with every state having no standard, state-wide election system.  I
agree that this is unacceptable, but I think we're stuck with the current
system at least for this election.  Otherwise they would have to throw out
all of the election.  

<p>
If they say ``voter intent" is insufficient, then 33 states have
unconstitutional laws.  Are they going to that step, now, under these
circumstances?  

<p>
Justice Kennedy suggested that the FSC could
ask the Secretary of State to declare a standard for counting votes.  This
is an interesting idea, even if it is not what the Democrats want.  Boies
suggested using the Texas standard.  One could argue that, since Bush
signed this into law, it would be plain hypocrisy for him to disagree.

<p>
I've given up on CNN - now I watch CSpan.  
<i>((Not having cable, I missed them all ;-) so I just read r.g.d!!!))</i>

<p>
Well, let's count the votes:
Breyer, Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter - will not vote to stop, are clearly
behind FSC
Kennedy, O'Connor - have serious problems with the lack of standards, do
not buy the idea that the FSC has made any errors in statutory
construction
Scalia - wants to argue that Article II of the Constitution means that the
FSC does not itself have appellate authority in this case.  Seems to be
alone here.  Really doesn't like the lack of standards.
Rehnquist - was mostly quiet
Thomas - I think he might have been reading a book today.  I really
dislike this guy.

The Bush supporters probably are not going to be happy, since the USSC
would seem to be unlikely to merely say ``you're not allowed to count the
votes".  Somehow, some way, these votes are to be counted.

<i>((But then a little bit later you ranted along like this:))</i>

<p>
<b>Rick Desper:</b>
This is a gonzo decision.  What the USSC is saying is that ``we think
that the FSC has said that the intention of the state legislature was to
have a Dec. 12 deadline and we will remand to the FSC for clarification.
Oh, and by the way, the recount procedure is unconstutional".

<p><br><p><br><b>Paul Windsor (Wed, 13 Dec 2000 16:47:43 GMT)</b>

<p>
Rick, I'm going to snip the rest of your post and start a new line here.

<p>
What the per curiam /1/ opinion of the USSC has held, in lawyerly terms, is
that the failure to define an exact standard for determining the ``intent of
the voter" on a recount is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the
14th Amendment.

<p>
/1/ Though per curiam decisions have no author, this one was fairly
obviously authored by O'Connor.

<p>
As you note in the part of the post I snipped, this is a novel occasion.
It's the first time in the history of this version of the Court that all
five of the Court's conservative justices, Scalia, Thomas, O'Connor,
Rehnquist &amp; Kennedy (hereinafter ``STORK") have all agreed that an Equal
Protection violation occurred in a case before them. Even more remarkably,
they ruled that the 14th Amendment controls here because there is a ``right
to vote", even though their previous per curiam decision stated emphatically
that Article II of the constitution grants no right to vote, and that to the
extent that the prior ruling of the Florida Supreme Court relied on such a
concept, its decision was invalid.

<p>
To merely state that these two opinions present some irreconcilable
inconsistencies requires a talent for understatement that I've not yet
mastered. This was a judicial exercise in ``bait and switch". The first
opinion sternly cautioned the FSC against adding to Florida election law in
any way, lest they transgress Article II. The second opinion now states,
under a legal theory that the USSC expressly declined the opportunity to
hear the first time /2/, that the FSC was required to rewrite the Florida
election code and was derelict in its duty for not doing so.

<p>
/2/ They denied cert on Bush's Equal Protection claims case, which he lost
at both the District Court and Appellate Court levels) on the same day that
they granted review of the first FSC case. This is doubly egregious, as the
equal protection claims were not briefed or argued at the circuit court or
FSC level in this case, presumably because they'd already lost. Normal
appellate procedure would forclose any further opportunity to even argue
such claims. Just a week ago, Justice Thomas dissented from deciding a 4th
Amendment case involving police road blocks on precisely these grounds. But
on this occasion, he joins the per curiam opinion without raising the issue.

<p>
In back to back decisions, the USSC has now ruled that: (i) there is no
merit in claiming that Florida election law must be modified to extend
recount deadlines, because there is no right to vote; and (ii) Florida
election laws governing recounts cannot be enforced, and should have been
rewritten by the FSC (but, alas, now there is not time to do so) because, as
written, the laws violate the right to vote.

<p>
The Supreme Court has now remanded for further proceedings consistent with
its holdings. Anyone who knows how to be consistent with those holdings,
please raise your hand.

<p>
Actually I do have an idea for what the FSC can do.

<p>
Further proceedings consistent with this new view of Equal Protection law
seem obvious to me. Based on the reliance the per curiam opinion places on
the ``one man, one vote" standard, together with the Court's admonition about
updating voting machines, the FSC should hold that it has no choice but to
find that Florida's county-by-county use of vastly different voting
technologies, with vastly different error and ballot rejection rates,
constitutes an EP violation, and that, in fact, no election was held in
Florida at all.

<p>
I know this doesn't change the result, since the Florida Legislature has
already named the Bush slate in the event of a failed election, but I'm not
result-oriented in thinking that the FSC should so hold. I just want to
force STORK to face head-on the issue of why there is a ``one man, one vote"
EP violation in the micro-issue, but there isn't one in the macro-issue. I
want STORK to explain why gross variations in *counting* standards, such as
rejecting up to 25% of ballots, solely due to the machines in use, in some
predominantly minority and poor voting precincts, is OK, but allowing much
slighter variations in RE-counting standards is not OK. I want them to
expalin why the plenary power of the legislature allows the former, but is
insufficient to justify the latter. This will instructively highlight the
point that STORK simply glides by the reality that we would never be in a
position of discussing whether there were variant counting standards for a
recount, if there weren't much more grossly variant counting standards for
the initial count. The per curiam opinon is in the goofy position of holding
that we should let stand a much more serious violation of ``one man one vote"
equal protection standards created by the machine count, because the
proffered remedy contains a much less significant violation of those same
standards.

<p>
The FSC has an opportunity to write their own ``dissent" on this point. I
know it won't be upheld, but it should help the media to focus on the right
issue for a change. If nothing else, it would make for entertaining reading.

<p>
Thankfully, the media is getting one thing right. Pretty much wholesale,
they are rejecting the per curiam decision's patently false claim to being
joined by 7 justices. The media seem to be pretty universally proclaiming
this a 5-4 decision split on political lines. That much of what they are
reporting, at least, is correct.

Jim,

<p>
I belatedly noticed a mention of the Diplomacy Encyclopedia in your November issue and took a look at it. In it I was surprised to see a mention of a zine, Mass Murders from 1983 and attributed to Bob Osuch. Sure, I attributed it to Bob at the time, but it was a spoof. It had intentionally bad spelling, included a player named Eric Ozog Sr. and had some typos that were occasionally unintentional and complained about not having a Boardman number yet for the Gacy game. 

<p>
I sent a note to Jim Meinel to clarify this, but he doesn't appear to be ready to do any updates any time soon. Oh well. I did have some chuckles over the memory and oddly enough, among all my papers, I was able to put my fingers on what is probably the last remaining copy.

In it I listed some of of my co-workers along with

An American, traveling on a  train  in  Europe,  met a Cuban tobacco
grower, a Russian vodka  distiller  and  a  lawyer.  While they were
talking business, the Cuban  took  out  four  cigars and passed them
around. After lighting his own  cigar,  the  Cuban took one drag and
then threw it out  the  window,  explaining  that  cigars were of no
consequence in his country  since  there  was  such  an abundance of
them. After dinner, the Russian  passed  out bottles of vodka. After
taking just one swig, he threw the bottle out the window, explaining
that vodka was  of  no  consequence  since,  in  Russia,  it  was so
plentiful. The American businessman  sat  in quiet contemplation for
several minutes then arose and threw the lawyer out the window.

Never one to be easily discouraged, Jim-Bob had enrolled at the John H.
Masters School of Bad Writing and Plagiarism. He passed the entrance exam
with flying colors, submitting a poorly written piracy of his favorite poet,  
Rod McKuen. Yes, old Jim-Bob had discovered his calling. He soared to the top
of his class, culminating his education with his Masters thesis, a pitiful
abortion entitled "Worms I Have Known". The Library of Congress would later
dub his masterpiece the worst piece of literature ever written. He graduated
in June of 1978, SUMMA CUM OBNOXIA.

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

<p>
REGULAR DIPLOMACY GAME OPENING: Why not? I find them cake to run,
let's open another regular game too..... I especially encourage
foreigners to join and others with E-Mail.
James Alan Tretick and Don Williams are signed up.

<p>
The other Diplomacy oriented opening left that I am GMing
in this szine is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at (new location, and including
that little typo on ``start trek''):

<p>
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/variants/rules/start_trek.htm

<p>
I decided how I will treat the Star systems and the ``revolving rings'' rule.
I will keep the map as a ``code" and the real locations (which I will
provide as names from Star Trek) will rotate through the coded spaces.
This WILL make it easy to make up maps.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Jack McHugh claims the Federation,
Chris Trent claims the Ferengi, Stephen Agar claims the Borg, and Jody McCullough claims the Romulans.
Buddy Tretick and Roland Sasseville, Jr., also are set to play. 
The other races in the game are the Klingons, Cardassians, Species 8472,
and the Vulcans.
We ONLY need two more, let's get this one going.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
I also am taking names for the new NYEED and Breaking Away games.
I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished.  
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.
Breaking Away has Jim Tretick signed up thus far.

1) Despite rumors to the contrary, Buddy has NOT resigned.

<p>
2) Randy Ellis has changed his E-Mail address ever so slightly, so it matches up
better to what I assume is his birth year.
And Rick Davis has moved his postal address.
I'm not sure if that phone number is still good, but I'll list it until Rick
tells me not to do so.
E-Mail for him remains the same.

<p>
3) Note Paul Rauterberg's new E-Mail address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ST PETERSBURG, JULY 27, 1904): Czar Nicholas II narrowly escaped 
assassination six days ago. It was initially believed that the 
assassination attempt had succeeded. As a result, several days passed 
where the government of Russia was paralyzed while local army 
detachments put down an armed insurrection. The `Decembrists', a radical 
anarchist league has claimed responsibility following the capture, 
deaths and subsequent executions of large numbers of the movement's 
adherents.

<p>
(BERLIN): The kaiser will be touring Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador 
and Honduras from January 4th to the 18th. Traveling incognito 
by chicken bus and ferry, he will be surveying various Maya ruins 
and sampling a number of cervezas Centroamericanas.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Just a note: in the Spring, France tried to have F Vancouver support
Army Yukon. 
That should have failed, since there is no way for a fleet to get to Yukon,
but I missed it.
Since it was not attacked, there was no effect. 

<p>
2) It takes me a long time to adjudicate this, but I think I'm getting
the hang of it.
I hope I have everything right.
If anyone has trouble with my conditionals on the Supply Center Chart,
just ask.
If Portugal retreats to Nizam, then Cuba will be the last Neutral
Supply Center left and it looks like Spain is a fixin' to nab it
next year.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RUSSIA to OTTOMAN): Are you getting bored with this ridiculous war with 
me yet?  You are due for rapid shrinkage, and I am SO sorry....

<p>
(MADRID): Bestowing great honor upon them, the Admiral Siesta of the Manila
 Fleet and General Snooze of the Kenyan Corp were invited to lead the
 annual running of the bulls.  Unforunately it seems that someone spilled
 a cask of olive oil on the streets in front of them and both dignitaries
 were gored and trampled.  Meanwhile, in other news, the permanent billets
 in Manila and Kenya were dismantled today as troops there prepared to move
 out as their new commanders issued the first movement orders seen this year.

<p>
(RUSSIA to CHINA): Are you getting bored with coddling the Sultan yet?  
He is hardly worth your trouble.

<p>
(NETHERLANDS-BOARD): As one of Netherlands' in Melbourne, our last holdings in the 
Pacific and our only defense of one fleet, we as a people have decided that 
we would rather be eliminated at peace then at war. Therefore our power has 
decided surrender.
<i>((Sean, I'll let you do this, but.... you could have made it more exciting.
You still have at least one more year to defend Melbourne.))</i>

<p>
(SEAN-JIM): Sorry, but I can't find a way around my inevitable collapse.  It is  
time to surrender. I wouldn't call a standby to cover my lone fleet it'll be 
pointless and a waste unless Austria and him decide to rebuild the 
Netherlands as a power to deal with the future. The chances of that is slim 
to none.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Unless superceded below, all rules are as in regular Diplomacy.

<p>
2) The game lasts seven game years (measured Winter to Winter, 1901 to 1907), 
with each player rotating through the powers in alphabetical order (AEFGIRT),
playing each power for one game year.  At the end of each game
year, the game board and positions are fully reset to the initial
positions.

<p>
3) Initial Positions: All units and supply center ownership are as in
regular Diplomacy, except that each player has five nuclear weapons
(except for Russia which has only four nuclear weapons).

<p>
4) Firing Nuclear Weapons: Each nuclear weapon (nuke) is fired 
at a specific province (land or sea) according to 
orders submitted by their owners immediately FOLLOWING the Spring
moves (nuke orders are submitted with those moves and cannot be made
conditional on any outcomes or moves in the Spring turn).
Nuclear weapon strikes destroy the supply center in the targeted
province, if any, as well as any units in that province following
the Spring turn.

<p>
5) Effects of Nuclear Weapons (Black Hole Variant): The effects of
the nuclear weapon strike are equivalent to those in the Black
Hole variant designed by Conrad von Metzke (Conrad is the unofficial
ombudsman for adjudication of paradoxes caused by this rule).
Any provinces adjacent to a nuke strike province are now themselves
adjacent.
The effect of nuke strikes on adjacent provinces creates a cumulative
effect such that all provinces adjacent to an a contiguous string of
nuke strike provinces are all simultaneously adjacent.
This effect applies to moves, supports, retreats, and convoys.
Coastal provinces that are nuked transmit their coastal status to
all adjacent provinces, which also is cumulative in effect.
These coastal status changes do not interfere with any army supports,
retreats, or moves between two land provinces separated by
a contiguous string of nuke strike provinces.

<p>
6) Victory Conditions: The game ends at the end of the seventh winter
adjustment season.
Victory points are garnered by cumulatively adding supply centers owned
at the end of each of the seven game years.
The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.
Ties are broken by sequentially comparing victory points owned in
1907 followed by each preceding year.
Players earning precisely the same number of victory points in each
of the seven game years remain tied.

<p>
7) I am taking reservations for the Edward Teller game, which will
be the next NYEED 7x7 game in this series.
Join THE most fun game in all Dipdom.
Harry Andruschak is on board.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM: <i>TAP</i>-239 with a deadline of 25 November arrived on 20 November. 
I am, of course, pleased that you will be using my suggestion for the name 
of the next NYEED.  Sign me up. I do have a two-week vacation to Egypt coming 
up in February, but that should not be too much of a distraction.

<p>
(JOHN THE BAPTIST MAJOR to MITTERAND):  Caught ya with ya pants down 
(ole boy.  Tough luck ole chap.  Better luck next millennium. 
    
<p>
THACKERY DACKERY DOC, THE DOC RAN OUT THE CLOCK - FATHER TIME):  
Nyeh, nyah, you didn't catch me.  I have three units where the sun never 
sets ready to wreak havoc on the civilized world.  Since France doesn't 
fall into that category and can't win anyway, beware those who can. 

<p>
(JOHN BOY to BARNO): Foiled again - playing second fiddle to the Master.

<p>
(ALLEN IVERSON to X-RATED (The rapper with 4 CD's released since 
being incarcerated for murder)):  Lend me some lyrics.

<p>
(JOHN BOY to BOOB): This ain't that jumping through nukes thing, is it?
<i>((You would know better than I.... sorry, couldn't resist ;-)  ))</i>

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-RICK DESPER): I note your comments on European cities.  I 
have just returned from a vacation that included 3 nights in Vienna and 1 
night in Amsterdam.  I had a great time in Vienna, helped out by not caring 
one way or another about the politics of Austria.  I went to a couple of 
Palaces, a couple of Museums, and spent an entire afternoon in the Prater, 
which included a ride on the famous Ferris wheel. Alas, I was unable to 
obtain any last-minute tickets to the opera or symphony. But we did tour the 
Vienna State Opera House and saw the backstage preparations for THE 
NUTCRACKER. As for Amsterdam, we only stayed one day, so I saw only the Van 
Gogh Museum. 

<p>
(SANDY BEACHES - MIKEY LIKES IT): Beware the tides of Rumania.  Flee 
to Sweden like all good pilots from Catch 22.

<p>
(HARRY-CAROL ROBERTS): I am starting a campaign fund for your race 
for Florida Governor next election.  Way to handle the recount.  I love 
those politics.
    
<p>
(BLACK MIKE to BIG AL): Way to steal the elections baby. 
  
<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-ALLEGED WEISS): Well, somebody wrote ``if you can still read 
after wanton drug doing in Europe" and my first reaction is ``Oh, lighten up, 
will ya". OK, it is true that in Amsterdam they have these coffee shops that 
also serve a variety of plants to smoke.  Rest assured that, as a sober 
member of AA since Saint Patrick's Day of 1984, I did not bother with that 
stuff. In any case, somebody like you might be more interested in the Red 
Light District. 
 
<p>
(RICHARD to ALL): Great fun.  Thank you.
    
<p>
WINNIE THE POOH CHURCH UP THE HILL - CATHERINE): I think the horse 
fell on you again.
    
<p>
(RICHARD to JIMBOOB AND THE FREETHINKER SARA): I am an agnostic 
atheist.  If I'd only known your religious views earlier - I would have 
nuked the GM more and you less, Madam Freethinker.  Power to the 
Freethinkers right on.  And, to those who quote Barlow/Weir - we are 
about to feel a touch of gray, all of us.  (They always took turns as 
you know).

<p>
(BOOB to RICHARD): Oh, yeah, go ahead and nuke the Christians, why don't
you??
Nuking me serves no useful purpose.... ;-)

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-GM): This round seems to be the poorest as far as use of 
Black Holes goes.  Turkey can attack Sweden with his units in the Black Sea 
and Armenia using the 4 Black Holes of Sevastopol, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, 
and Norway.  Both Italy and Germany can also attack Sweden using the 4 Black 
Holes of Munich, Berlin, Kiel, and Denmark.  However, it may be that Germany 
will use his units to prevent England from taking Belgium.

<p>
(MIKE to WILDERNESS FANS):  People are joking that ``If Marc Racicot
becomes secretary of the interior, he's planning on hunting in the
[Yellowstone] park next year."  Yeah, if the election debacle finally
goes Bush's way, they can license Helen's buffalo-burger stands

(WILD TURKEY to CORED AUSTRIA-HUNGARY):  The Turkish people and their
representatives have more memory than a gnat, and thus have not
forgotten Austro-Hungarian perfidy in the violation of our erstwhile
alliance.  Nor have walls been cleansed of the blood from years of your
policy involving increased Death status.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Wow, lots of blood this turn!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE / TURKEY / ITALY):  Who will be gone first?  Who will 
still be alive when Germany gets to 18?  I think Turkey has the best 
chance as he is furthest from the steamroller.

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA):  Finish me off?  And why, exactly, would they go out 
of their way to do that?  I mean other than my oh-so-valuable dot.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA/AUSTRIA): Ok, I found out who was lying, and who I owed
the apology to.  I think.

<p>
(STEVE to JIM-BOB):  I figure all the Dipping lawyers are intimidated by 
the level of the competition and are unwilling to sign up for a 
butt-whippin' by joining The Professional Division. 

<p>
(BOOB to STEVE): I have had some trouble recruiting them to sign up for
sure.  I think I can convince Edwin Turnage to get in now.  
Apparently, he's a College Football freak.
I figured this issue should arrive on his doorstep right after the Bowl
games, when he is weak..... and Bush should have chosen his cabinet
and Edwin will be trying to drink away the pain of not being chosen.

<p>
(GERMANY to TURKEY): Secretary of Scotch-making doesn't appeal to you?

<p>
(ENGLAND to FRANCE): Well, I finally got both Portugal and Spain.  I 
never thought I would lose everything else in the process.

<p>
(SPIDER ALUMNUS to ORANGE ALUMNUS): Richmond has announced it's leaving 
the Colonial Athletic Association, effective next summer, to join the 
Atlantic 10.  The Colonial is so happy about that, they have banned us 
from the postseason basketball tournament, so the only way we can make 
the NCAA's is to earn an at-large berth.  Too bad; we're predicted to be 
the best team in the conference, with every player (not just starters; 
everybody) returning from last year's 18-12 team.  22 wins isn't out of 
the question, but it will take some doing.  I'm frankly hoping we can 
play the Bluebellies (UNC) in the finals of the holiday tournament we 
play in this year.  (Hey, it's okay to dream, right?)  At least we've 
got size; the smallest starter is 6-4, and everyone else is at least 
6-7.

<p>
(BOOBISH BASKETBALL BRILLIANT BON-MOTS): I think the A-10 will be
better for having Richmond.
Another slam dunk success for the best Conference Commissioner 
who isn't a man, Linda Bruno, and might be one of the best overall.
The A-10 is very down in basketball this year, but will parlay that
into improvements next year.
One feels a bit sorry for John Chaney.... I only wish the best for 
Temple playing it ``their way''.
The Big East also is a bit down (despite the high rankings of some
of the teams at the moment), but you can count on Boston College
MAKING the Tournament and the local PC Friars ending up as one of
those 65th teams just missing it.
Both teams have been building up really impressive team play
outings that will surprise those ranked Big East teams when 
January comes.
Both teams are benefiting from players returning from injuries.
John Lenihan for PC, being the point guard and leader, was the
biggest of those losses.
Looks like another fun college basketball season upcoming....

<p>
(CANADIENS FAN, WITH A BAG OVER HIS HEAD): When does baseball season 
start?

<p>
(LONDON to WELLINGTON): Hold on, you are your country's last best hope.

<p>
(EMMERT to RUSNAK): Are YOU still around?  Hey, say something; I want to 
see if it's true that you only lie when your lips move.

<p>
(JAMES to THE NON-GERMANS): Come on, you can coordinate better than that. 
Did anyone at least ask the Turk to stay out of the Ionian so the 
Austrians and Russians can get out of Turkey?  If not, why not?

(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``I drank and drugged myself in
the taverns and the alleys; 
I don't know what I have inside me, something wants to come out;
I absolutely had to leave, I was sick of violent scenes;
they don't mean a fucking thing to me.
Flowers of flesh in starry fields uncurled, stretched out alone;
I'll take the smell of your skin back to my room.
Where do murderers go man?
Who's to doom when the judge is up for trial?
I cannot tell a lie; I cannot tell the truth.''
From ``Lyric'' off of <i>Curse of the Mekons</i>.     
 
<p>
(PAUL to STARTREK MAN): Isn't it the Romulans who have the cloaking 
device, or have the Klingons been advancing behind my back?

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): I hate to complain, but last move's first Star Trek
log was a re-run and the log that you had missed from the previous
move is still missing.
In a way, having a re-run makes this a little like the real Star Trek.
<i>((Hyork, hyork, hyork!!!))</i>
Is it possible that the person doing your data entry is from Palm
Beach, Florida?....

<p>
(BOOB to JEFF): Impossible!!! I've never been to Palm Beach!!!

<p>
(JIM-BOB to JEFF): Seriously though, I'm not sure what happened, and I 
can't seem to find the one that was missing.
It really wasn't intentional and I'll try to keep up in the future.
Sure you don't want to send the press via Sean's E-Mail  ;-)
No, I guess not.... then again, I COULD be ``Q''!!

<p>
(UKRAINE - GERMANY): In response to your plea for help we are sending a
 top notch force of accountants and tax lawyers to straighten out your
 mess.  Our first assessment is that you have over diversified and should
 divest yourself of some of your acquisitions.  We will assist you 
 in implementing this new business plan to the best of our ability.

<p>
(KIRK to STARFLEET): Captain's Log Supplemental; whatever that means.
We are preparing for our next battle, but we have another problem.
We have been getting interference from ``Q'' again.
He blocked my Captain's Log to Starfleet two cycles ago and when I attempted
to reinitiate the message and send it back to fleet headquarters, he changed
it to a previously submitted log.
I can't keep copies of these logs because we are saving our energy
reserves for only essential systems (I don't have a copier).
I'm thinking the best thing for me to do now is resubmit the log.

<p>
Mr. Spock stole a cloaked Klingon scout ship along with Mr. Checkoff. 
And a few guys wearing red shirts flew to the mouth of the wormhole
to gather intelligence on Romulan/Ferengi maneuvers.
Spock forgot to put his bifocals on and accidentally de-cloaked the ship,
allowing the Romulans to capture him and everyone on board.
Rumor has it they are torturing Spock by making him go without sleep while
forcing him to watch pro wrestling 24 hours a day.
The idea is to break Spock into revealing Federation long range tactical plans.
Of course most of our long range plans have phrases like ``we surrender'' 
and/or ``Scotty, get us out of here'', so I'm not too worried.
The Romulans have also apparently destroyed Voyager although it wouldn't
surprise me if Captain Janeway got the crew out.
Too bad, I really wanted to do, I mean meet, 7 of 9. 
Kirk out...

<p>
(ROME): Take that, you nasty O'Donnells you!

<p>
(UKRAINE - SPAIN): Was this the him you were referring to?

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to SPAIN): Balance of power.  That's the key.

<p>
(SPANISH NATIONAL NEWS): The modern war has evoloped across the world with 
little means of slowing its tide while the three super powers of Italy, 
Germany, and Ukraine make way to conquering all of Europe.   
The people of Spain rejoice over the takings of Mar from the Italian 
warlord Eric Ozog and a allied victory in African soil of Tunisia of the 
complete obliteration of two Italian forces.

<p>
(ITALY-SPAIN &amp; EGYPT): I'm not worried and am able to scavenge for myself. 
Marseilles will slip through your fingers and there will soon be Egyptian
depots available to ease my hunger.

<p>
(SPANISH TRIBUNE): General Mark Phillips commandering officer of Mar was 
interviewed before any part of battle could take place when asked what was 
the possibility of losing Mar to the Italian warlord.
``Mar has many chances of falling pending on the planning of powers that be 
decide to plan its attack."
In further extent of the war for Europe all seems lost in terms that the 
Spanish Empire under President Sean O'Donnell Commander and Chief of Spain.
The President has only said that his attack teams have now been put into 
Special forces known as the Klingon strike force.
When asked why the Klingons for the name he only said, ``The name from 
Spanish text means men of Pride and skill."

<p>
(ITALY-GERMANY): Pull my strings baby!

<p>
(EGYPT to ANYONE): Wouldn't it be cool if Ukraine and Germany and Italy attacked
Italy this move?
Wouldn't that be great???
<i>((I wanna see Italy attack himself....))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): 1,2 I'm coming for you, 3,4 better lock your door, 5,6 grab 
your crucifix, 7,8 don't stay up late, 9, 10 you'll never sleep again.

<p>
Eric looks at me,
``Did you say something" he asked.

<p>
``No, just saying someone is coming for you." said Sean.

<p>
``Who?" asked Eric.

<p>
``Destiny." said Sean.

<p>
Eric's eye's flooded with pride thinking of taking over the world.

<p>
``Yeah, but what if Ukraine double crosses you." said Sean...

<p>
(ITALY-SPAIN): I may very well die, but I will try to take you and Unca
Jeffrey down with me.

<p>
(ROME-GM): What is with all this ``Klingons circling Uranus" press anyway?
<i>((Beats the hell out of me.... as I understand it, it is a response to
my Mekons press.....))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN-EGYPT): Hang on we're coming.

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK to THE WORLD): I've been watching the election recount
fiasco and at this point I have to go on record that I do not support
Al Gore's effort to steal this election.
I think the best thing to do is accept the mechanical recounts and wait for
the overseas ballots to come in.
I feel that the Palm Beach butterfly ballot issue is a classic case of the
social disease penetrating our society whereby no one who ever does anything
stupid ever takes responsibility for their own actions.
I want no part of it.

<p>
(TO THE BLACK PRESS WRITER): Can't you think of something else for me to 
be saying than perpetually ``help"?
I can help myself quite well, thank you.

<p>
(BRITAIN-GERMANY): I'm thinking, I'm considering!
