All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
Only a <i>Deny Everything</i> appears this issue as <i>Houdini Blues</i> has
been reported slightly delayed.
I'll try to put the next <i>DE</i> and <i>HB</i> up on the web site before the
deadline for #255 if I can.
The next <i>Tinamou</i> deadline should be February 18, 2002.

<p>
This issue of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> is dedicated to Emeric Miszti as
we fervently wish Emeric a return to financial and emotional well-being,
following a disasterous shutdown of his ISP Cloud Nine.
See more on this in the szine below.

<p><br><p><br>``You'll see me one more time if you do good, and you'll see me two more
times if you do bad.'' a character only known as ``The Cowboy'' from 
David Lynch's <i>Mulholland Drive</i>.
How about no more times.... which is how many times you actually DO
see the Cowboy..... more below.
Actually, this was one of the lines I really did LIKE in the movie!!

<p><br><p><br>``Oooooohhhh, ahhhhhhhh, eeeeeeeeeee, ooooooooohhhhh'' from ``Constantinople''
by the brilliant jazz vocalist Patricia Barber off her CD <i>Modern Cool</i>
- and so it is.
More importantly, Patricia is preparing a new record to come out this year
which is getting just incredible pre-release buzz in places where I look
for such things.
She is on the schedule to appear on the NPR show ``Piano Jazz'' the week of March 5th,
listen for it on public radio near you.... unfortunately, my RI station doesn't
get it!

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I am slowly getting things back together.  This issue is the ``final supply
center chart'' issue, which has the three games that have recently finished.
Get your endgame statements to me now!  And those of you players in those
games who have been free riding will now face issues of how you will continue
to get the szine.
Next issue is planned to be the music issue.  
That likely will become the music issues.

<p>
Note below the call for the next Diplomatic Incident in Boston, March 2-3.
Since the Patriots won the Super Bowl, Doug Massey will be buying my dinner
on March 2 plus the dinner for the longest traveler to the housecon.
Right now, that looks like Rick Desper, but if you are farther away 
from Boston than Gaithersburg, MD, you can win!!
Since I don't have to buy my own dinner, I have added an additional dinner
prize that I will be providing for the person who comes the farthest but
LESS than the distance to Gaithersburg.  
This is intended to encourage the NY/Philly crowd to show up.

<p>
I should say a bit about how I won this bet with Doug Massey, since as you
all know I am NOT a football fan.
I like the analysis of football OK and some of the personalities, but I
hate the rhythm of watching or listening to the games.  
I much prefer the rhythm of baseball, hockey, or basketball.
If I were football god, I would mandate no huddle offenses and that would
be fun.
It is such a game of hitting and speed but then it just comes to a stop.
More importantly, present company excluded, I really don't like football
fans, especially Texas football fans. 
Spending the ``Jim-Bob'' year (the 1982-83 year when I acquired that nickname)
in Dallas and watching Cowboys games (until the strike hit) and Southern 
Methodist U. games, and teaching SMU football players in the classroom
just soured me on the whole sport.
I've never really gotten interested again.

<p>
BUT, I really like the Diplomatic game theory aspects of football,
even if I don't like watching games and players. 
I analyzed THAT in the week before the Super Bowl and concluded (almost 
totally dispassionately and completely scientifically - I didn't even 
bother to watch the game, no need ;-) - I was going to go see ``Black Hawk
Down'' during the Super Bowl instead, but didn't quite make it to see
that until a few days later) that the Patriots had a 79% chance of
winning the game, the Rams had a 19% chance of winning the game by MORE
than the 14 point spread and a 2% chance of winning the game by less than
that spread.
I announced this in various places before the game, so I could be held to it.
Basically, I saw the game theory of how the game would be played.  
The Patriots would get fired up by the ``lack of respect'' for their
team, so Coach Belichick would put in a ``hitting'' defense that would
bang the Rams around one on one.
Either the Rams would score quickly by standing up to the hits and running
around them, and then they would win big, or they were DEAD, since
they would get more and more desperate and start going ``turtle'' - the
hockey term for when players back off and lose their aggressiveness in
the face of being hit.
I've seen a few replays of key plays and one of those desperation plays
is exhibited by the Ty Law interception and another by one of the last
plays of the first half where they put Marshall Faulk in on the kick return
team after the Patriots' second touchdown.
Rather than letting the ball go out of bounds and get the ball upfield in
position to play for a late field goal (which given the rest of the 
second half would have changed the nature of the last plays), Faulk fielded
the ball, trying to ``overdo it'' and wasted the last possession by being
tackled way back.
So, this is what I expected, call me nuts, but I expected it.

<p>
Anyway, Doug Massey called me on this and made me bet these two dinners
to back up what he saw as outrageous statements.  
I bet on the Patriots vs. the Rams heads up, without a point
spread, since I didn't think there was much of any chance the game would end up 
in that winning range for the Rams less than the 14 point spread.
Obviously, I won.
It won't make me like football again, but it does make me like again 
studying the combination of psychological strategy and chesslike tactics
that the coaches of football have to use.  
Again, as a dispassionate observer, I was really impressed with the coaching
strategy of Bill Belichick.
It was really a lot of fun watching him put together a real team this year
step by step.
Actually watching the games would have been irrelevant..... mostly kidding,
but I still don't have any urge to watch.
Let's see if he can do it again, or more importantly can this help to 
break the Red Sox curse and get THEM to play like a team!!

<p>
Mark Kinney is folding his small szine, <i>League of Nations</i>, which had one
game in it that I was playing in (as is Warren Goesle and David Partridge).
If Don or Michael or Russ would like to pick up the game and run in <i>TAP</i>
they would be welcome and could contact Mark Kinney for details at
alberich of iglou.com - I think there is only one player who is not a <i>TAP</i>
subber and I would offer one free if it is picked up here.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My Red Sox team is looking great for next year and so I'm very excited.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A FEW NEW PLAYERS!!
Contact John Caruso at commishjohn of att.net or me for more details.
We have two teams left open at the moment, but one of those MIGHT
be taken.
Don't be left out.
Exhibition baseball play starts this week and then I'll get a chance
to see if I really have put together a contender.

Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hearby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis.
In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 
I think we really DO have Rip Gooch as the representative volunteer, more forthcoming
on that.
Also, see Peter's note below, it looks like that 2002 date is slipping back.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR BILL QUINN</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>Bill Quinn was the Boardman Number Custodian in the mid-1980's and won the
Don Miller Award for Meritorious Service to the Hobby in 1986.
More specifically, he was Publisher of <i>Everything</i> during the 
Don Ditter and Kathy Byrne Caruso Custodianships (issue numbers 53-62)
and then took over the Boardman Number Custodianship itself from 
August 1984 to August 1986.
Bill was known for his efforts to organize the BNC records and as
a tireless worker at the task, during a period of one of the highest
rates of game starts in the history of the position.
Naturally, Bill burned out on this eventually and has dropped out of sight.
I think it is time to find him again.... you have until next issue, #255!!
Action on the search for's has been lagging lately, use the Internet
for something, search for people!!
The name ``Bill Quinn" only generates 2,630 hits on Google and ``Al 
Pearson'' only generates 728!!
<i>((Admittedly, a chunk of these hits are generated through mentions
in TAP, but hey, whaddya know?))</i>
You'll really kick yourself if the AREA person named Al Pearson is the
one that I'm looking for, for example and you can track him down pretty
easily.
Ask our AREA Diplomacy pal Glenn Petroski, gelp of juno.com, if you don't know what
AREA is.....
I'm not amused that the rate of searching seems to have dropped lately,
go find these guys!!!
Earn REAL money, this is NOT an Internet scam!!!

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer

There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
I think we can maneuver deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
This should help out my Australian subbers!!

<p>
<p>Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Goes ON!!

<p>
The second round is now over.  This year a large number of
players went on to Round 2, before they narrowed to the Semi-Final Round
of Seven games to determine who goes to the Finals. 
Prominent semifinalists include: David Malloch (one of last year's finalists),
Paraic ``Fred'' Reddington (tall Irish elfin Diplomat as hard as nails!),
Jack Brawner (best known as Dick Martin's childhood pal), Paul Riley (GM
extraordinaire who proves he can play too!!), Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu
(I'm learning Norwegian so I can talk to him and Frank Johansen in their
own language... my first E-Mails to Joe were more or less understandable),
Yann Clouet (one of France's greatest exports to the English speaking world),
Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira (extremely, even by Dipping standards, arrogant
Brazilian... don't let him bowl you over), Thomas Franke (long acknowledged
as the best German player in the world, showing he's not washed up),
Stephen Agar (my <i>Diplomacy World</i> co-editor is showing he can
play the game with finesse!), Fearghal ``Twerg'' O'Donnchu (the Irish
wildman!!), Christian Dreyer (winner of tournaments and demo games,
extremely dangerous!), Brian Dennehy (wow, he is just a great player,
not second in any book of mine), Jody McCullough (yes, our very own Bay
Area whiz!), Frank Johansen (the aforementioned other Norwegian and the
President of the Norwegian Diplomacy Association), and Chetan Radia
(he of the only 18 center win at this summer's World DipCon). 
Expect this Tournament not to end for another year, though we are obviously
already well into 2001.
The next tournament in the series will be WorldMasters 2002, starting sometime
next year.

<p>
Jody McCullough had the dubious distinction of being the first semi-final player
eliminated, after being jumped by Frank Johansen and Yann Clouet.
Watch out for Frank and Yann now!!!
They are jousting with each other as the Semifinal rounds work into their pressure
packed C-Diplo driven supply center count based ends.
Can Frank (who is leading) get into the Finals???

But a disaster has struck Cloud Nine and its estimable CEO Emeric Miszti.
You can read details of this at http://www.zetnet.com which is the ISP
that Emeric sold out Cloud Nine Communications Ltd.'s contracts to.
In a nutshell, what happened was that someone or someones blasted cloud-nine.com
with various kinds of Denial of Service attacks.  
They ended up being so serious that they collapsed Emeric's whole system
and his company.
I can't even imagine what a nightmare this has been to Emeric.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>SUMMARY

<p>
The Carolina Amateur Diplomats again will host the 2002 Dipcon,  in
conjunction with Dixiecon 16.  Dixiecon is the longest-running Diplomacy
tournament site in North America, and has a proven track record for
attracting the top players on this continent and beyond.  Here are other
highlights of the Dipcon at Dixiecon experience, in summary fashion:
Diplomacy games at Dixiecon do not have a time limit (except for the
last round), and are played until there is a win, stalemate demonstrable to
the GM, or unanimously voted result.
  
<p>
The costs of the Dixiecon event are relatively low, at an estimated $18
per night to share a double room, and $18 registration fee.
At Dixiecon, Diplomacy is the focus of most of what goes on, which leads
to a very special and meaningful event designed to lead to the formation of
lasting real-life alliances (i.e. friendships.)  The success of this
approach can be seen in the relationships forged amongst the Dixiecon
faithful over 15 prior events, including the hosting of the 1990 and 1998
Dipcon/World Dipcon events and the 1994 Dipcon.

(1987), Mark Stegeman (1988 and 1991), Dave McCrumb (1989), Mark
Franceschini (1992), Jim Yerkey (1993), Bruce Allen (1996), Chris Martin
(1998 and 1999), Tom Kobrin (2000) and Roy Rink (2001).  We are still
working on the others - Jason Bergmann (1990), Bruce Reiff (1994 and 1997)
and Marc Peters (1995).  Even without these last three, such a field would
be a tremendous collection of Diplomacy talent and years of experience all
by themselves.  Three of these past masters, Gurley/Stegeman/McCrumb, were
some of the top players of their day but have not been in circulation in the
wider Diplomacy circuit for about 10 years.  When combined with the Young
Turks of today, this will be quite a lineup.  Some of the above winners were
also Dipcon champions, and we also expect past Dipcon Champs Dan Sellers
(1988), Edi Birsan (1989) and even the 1987 and 2001 winner David Hood might
be seen poking around Chapel Hill over the weekend... Whoever wins this
Dipcon will surely have a feather in his or her cap.

<p>
EASTERN SWING
       
<p>
Dixiecon is the second leg of the inaugural year for the Eastern
Swing, a four-event combination award which will honor those who travel and
do well at the four established east coast tournaments.  These include
Prezcon in Charlottesville VA (Feb), Dixiecon (May), and both WBC (Aug) and
Tempest(Oct)  in Maryland.
Andy Marshall will be scoring this competition, and will be bestowing the
Eastern Swing Honors at the anchor leg, Tempest.  The system will reward
consistent and excellent play at these events, so a player must not only
attend but also place well in order to have a chance for the Honors.

QUESTIONS?

<p>
Chances are there will be someone you know in the Hobby who has participated
in a past Dixiecon.  Ask for their opinions.  In addition, future
newsletters will contain  information on registration, housing, and other
details.  We hope to have the opportunity to put on the type of event we
found highly successful for the Dipcons in 1990, 1994 and 1998.  Come down
south and enjoy our college-town atmosphere and high-level competition at
the 2002 Dipcon.  We predict you will not be disappointed.  Email David Hood

<p> Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<p>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the ``current'' as well as an older
version of the rules there.  Check these out if you like:

Greetings!

<p>
Diplomatic Incident XV will be held in Boston, MA on March 2nd and
3rd, 2002.  You are welcome to drop in unannounced, but it does help
with the planning if you let me know you might be coming.

<p>
Diplomatic Incident is a house con, lots of good Diplomacy and gaming,
no set rounds or scoring.  For more details, go to
www.diplom.org/DipIncid.

<p>
Taylor Hayward (a regular at recent DIs and a driving force in the
local Boston FTF scene) joins us this time as co-host (letting Jack's
wife and new son enjoy the weekend in peace!). The setting will be
Taylor's Apartment at 1033 Beacon Street, Boston MA. Gaming will start
Saturday at 11AM, with the door opening at 10AM. Crash space is
available for those who need it, bringing your own sleeping bag is
recommended. Please let me know ahead of time if you need space. If
you can provide space in the Boston area please let me know as well.
                      
<p>
Directions
 
<p>
Via the T:
Take the Green C line to St. Mary's T stop. 1033 Beacon Street is five
doors down.
 
<p>
Via car:
Drive to Kenmore Sq. (Citgo sign, Fenway, etc.). Take Beacon Street
out of Kenmore away from Boston. Go through a set of lights and find
the nearest parking space. Sorry, no garages. 1033 Beacon Street is
right near by.

<i>Octopus' Garden</i> status

<p>
Whilst checking various other things on the web, I came across my 
own home page, and decided that I had better do something about 
the claim that <i>Octopus' Garden</i> would be back ``later in 2001, or 
by the start of 2002 at the latest." 

<p>
I have therefore updated the <i>Octopus's Garden</i> index page at:
 
<p>
 http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html
to make it clear that the subzeen is now in official indeterminate 
stasis, as opposed to ostensible determinate statis. I *think* that 
last sentence even means what I think it's meant to.

<p>
``Remember, old subzeens never die, they just go into official 
indeterminate stasis..."

Jim-Bob,

<p>
Ya want ``not funny"?  There have been 3 teams who have won more than 1 World
Series since 1986 (without looking ahead, can you name more than 1 of
them?).  They're planning on ``contracting" one of them in '03.  How would
you like to be the guy in charge of season ticket sales for the Twins in '02?

<i>((No thanks.
I instantly knew the answer to this.... one of the others is Canadian.... but not
the one that is going to be contracted.
And the third is the obvious one....
I like the idea of contraction, myself.
Sorry, Minnesota (no sympathy for Montreal required), but them's the breaks.
I wouldn't want to spend your short summer in a dome either, and you have
a fun young team, but you haven't supported it.
You want things ``fixed'' but this is the only way the Commish is going to

The Fellowship of the Ring Movie

<p>
Jim, Here is my take on this movie which I have seen twice now (and 
which I will probably see again in a theatre).

<p>
This movie draws you in and transfixes you to the screen so real 
time seems to be suspended. The movie is very fast paced with little 
time to reflect on what has gone before. I really enjoyed the depiction 
of the Isildur/Sauron battle, the hill of Weathertop and the 
confinement/escape of Gandalf from Isengard. In a way, the movie depicts 
these sequences of events more clearly than does the book itself.

<p>
Although visually impressive some of the background sets have too 
much detail. A term for this type of art is its being ``too busy" which 
means there is too much detail and this distracts the eye to the 
detriment of the art itself. This weakness is evident in this movie.
<i>((My wife is a costume designer, and I know that ``overdesign''
bothered her especially.))</i>

<p>
My main criticism of the background sets was the ``Escher-like" 
stairways to nowhere in the mines of Moria and which inexplicably were 
built partially of brick! (this inside a mountain where Dwarves worked 
solid stone) Bah - mortar &amp; pestle!

<p>
Without doubt, this movie can never (could never) satisfy all the 
myriad fans of LotR. I have several additional criticisms.

<p>
1) The very unbelievable escape of the Hobbits from the Nazgul at the 
Brandywine Ferry plus the omission of the visit with Farmer Maggot

<p>
2) The omission of Old Man Willow, the Barrow-wight and Tom Bombadil and 
Goldberry. To have excluded these characters in a three hour movie was a 
gross error.

<p>
3) Was one reference to ``A great cave-troll, I think, ..." (The 
fellowship of the Ring, Chp V, The Bridge of Kazad-dum, Pg 342 of the 
Harper Collins 1991 edition) reason to include a fight sequence with 
said troll (while being an impressive fight, it was stupidly made 
comical) that does not exist in the book? I say NO! This criticism 
relates to my major criticism of this movie which is...

<p>
4) The utterly ridiculous depiction of the Orcs in this movie by 
adhering to the current mindless Hollywood obsession with ``grossing the 
viewer out by trying to have the ugliest monster possible" (and which is 
guaranteed to frighten young children). Admittedly, Orcs probably don't 
look very nice but `poster paint' running down their heads like there is 
a leaking water tap? - Gimme a break!  The Orcs were a race of beings 
like the others, they would have had females and young like any other 
race and, consequently, would have had a primitive `human-type' society. 
Plus, the movie ignores some of the dialogue the Orcs were given in the 
book. My point is the Orcs were not the `Halloween caricatures' nor the 
`insect wall climbers' that the movie depicts them as.

<p>
<i>((You will recall that I mentioned (4) specifically, and was thinking
of (1) and (3) - (2) bothered ME not a whit.))</i>

<p>
In conclusion, one might think I didn't like the movie. However, I 
did. The director got enough right and got the pacing right to make the 
movie entertaining. It is a good movie bordering on greatness. A three 
out of five stars (maybe a four, if you are generous and ignore its 
faults).

Re: Tenenbaums

<p>
I have to agree with you except for the ``Zoolander" part.  It was fun and 
quite clever in part, but not up to the other two.  A third film that I 
really liked was ``The Gift".  It didn't make much of a splash.  Then too, it 
was early 2001 and this is early 2002.

Perhaps I should have been expecting a lot less.... 
but I'd heard a variety of good reviews from both respected (Roger Ebert)

I should have known, though, critics always like movies about the movies. 
This really is an extremely damning

I really loved that movie - go rent it if you've never seen it!!!

``Kung Pow:  Enter the Fist" - a movie

<p>
Steve Oedelerk has a weird sense of humor and an obvious love of martial arts 
movies.
He wrote, produced, and starred as ``The Chosen One" in ``Kung Pow".  There 
were no chicken jokes.

<p>
The movie was filmed over existing martial arts flics using the blue screen 
technique that made ``Forrest Gump" famous.  It was then dubbed mismatching 
mouth movements with sound.  The general effect was pretty funny. 

<p>
Still, you can afford to wait for it to come out on HBO.

<p>
``Le Pacte des Loups" AKA ``Brotherhood of the Wolves" - a movie

<p>
This is a French film with English subtitles.  The cast are all French or 
Italian except for Mark Dacascos who is Hawaiian.  He plays ``Mani" an 
American Indian Shaman Martial Artists.

<p>
The story is complex.  It starts out to be a simple hunt for a monstrous 
beast that has been terrorizing the Gevaudan Province in France.  The period 
is the time of the American Revolution.  The characters in the movie refer to 
our land as ``New France."

<p>
The King of France sends a naturalist and world traveler, Le Chevalier de 
Fronsac to investigate the beast, and to return with it to Paris once it has 
been captured.  Fronsac travels with Mani who has a mysterious affinity with 
the beasts of the forest.

<p>
Fronsac and Mani arrive just in time to save a healer and his daughter from 
being beaten by ruffians.  Fronsac demonstrates some remarkable martial arts 
skills of his own. The ruffians turn out to be members of the force that is 
hunting the beast. 
A great hunt for the beast manages to kill a lot of wolves, and gives Mani a 
chance to demonstrate his martial arts skills.

<p>
Actually, the above is sort of the prelude.  The real story starts after the 
hunt.  Fronsac continues to investigate and discovers clue by clue that the 
beast is neither natural nor supernatural.  There are many characters and 
they all seem to have secret agendas.

<p>
And what French story would exist without some old fashioned revenge.  It's 
all here.

<p>
Along with the complex story there is some really excellent cinematography.  
The special effects are the weakest part of the movie.  Computer generated 
effects have pretty much ruined me for the older technology.

``Black Hawk Down" - a movie

<p>
The men and boys who go to war have an agreement that whether spoken or 
unspoken is a large part of what keeps them doing what they do.  The 
agreement is, ``No man gets left behind."

<p>
That's what ``Black Hawk Down" is about.  In 1993 there was supposed to be a 
`surgical strike' into the enemy held part of Mogadishu to capture some of 
the rebel leadership.  A surface force backed up by Black Hawk Helicopters 
went in, took their objective, and started back out.  Then a lucky shot with 
a rocket propelled grenade brought one of the choppers down.

<p>
The surface convoy was redirected to the crash site to try to rescue any 
survivors.  What followed was utter and complete chaos with most of the 
Americans having little idea other than that they were being shot at from all 
sides what was going on.

<p>
Ridley Scott did a fine job of showing that chaos.  He also did a fine job of 
personalizing it by picking out a few individuals to follow.  Some made it.  
Some died.  Many were wounded.  The Somali's were poorly armed in comparison 
to the Americans, but there were thousands of them.

<p>
This may not be a great movie, but it comes awfully close.

Charlotte had her usual reaction of just wanting to obliterate the useless
Somali's from the face of the earth.
It does make you realize how difficult this sort of thing can be to manage.
But I think a very important part of the movie was a part where Somalis NOT
loyal to Aidid were cheering a group of Rangers jogging away from 
Aidid's troops.
There IS a reason for doing this.
And we want to help rebuild these countries, not send them further into the
Stone Age.
That is STILL my opinion about Afghanistan - an opportunity that we appear
to be squandering.
Don't build more planes, smart bombs and fancy electronic war machines.

Hi, This is Eric Klien from The Atlantis Project.  I last e-mailed you in
1995 and am now e-mailing you yet again.  (You subscribed to my The
Atlantis Project/Oceania mailing list.)

<p>
In retrospect, the biggest problem The Atlantis Project had was a lack
of interest.  Upon further research, the biggest reason for a lack of
interest is that there aren't a lot of Libertarians out there and few of
those have much money.  The poor performance of Libertarian candidates
throughout the nation is reflective of this lack of support.

<p>
So basically what I am saying is that Libertarian candidates shouldn't
expect to raise much money, and Libertarian causes should expect the
same.  I still give money to Libertarian causes, but you need to be
realistic about what you hope to achieve.  There just aren't many of
us Libertarians...

<p>
I put a huge amount of effort into The Atlantis Project and wish it had
worked.  I learned many lessons from that project and used them to run a
fairly large web hosting company for the past six years.  But I couldn't
make The Atlantis Project work even if I used the knowledge I have
gained since I tried to run it the first time.

<p>
On the positive side, I have found an idea that research shows is backed
by more than just Libertarians.  I have already procured considerable
funding for it and will launch this idea, which is a save the human race

you can find me through the Internet system at

If anyone has an interest in having an E-Mail address listed so people

Thanks to a suggestion by Mike Barno, from now on I will be noting 
cut or failed support orders with a small ``s'' instead of a capital ``S''.
This will make it easier on the web page version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
I may forget every once in a while, but I will TRY to remember.
I should also get an updated copy of my translation program for TeX to
html, perhaps that has been fixed.

<p>
 Standby lists:

<p>
Bruce Linsey, Mike Barno, Dick Martin, Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Glenn
Petroski, Steve Emmert, Mark Kinney, Vince Lutterbie, Eric Brosius,
Paul Rauterberg, Bob Acheson,
Heath Gardner, Phil Reynolds, Paul Kenny, Dan Gorham, and John Schultz
stand by for regular Diplomacy.

<p>
Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Phil Reynolds, Jim Sayers, 
and Kurt Ozog
stand by for the Modern Diplomacy game.

<p>
Harold Reynolds stands by for Colonia.
Help, more are needed for this game, maps are provided for free by me....
or by Harold Reynolds just ask.

<p>
Let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF.
Standbies get the szine for free and receive my personal thanks.

GAME OPENING INFORMATION</td></table><!--hboxt--> 

<p>
<p>LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage but they have turned us down.
Plus I'm still looking for a current address for Mark Franceschini.
Official standby for the game is David Hood.
HELP!!!
Will this ever begin?? 
You lawyers are going to have to scour the depths of the sewers.... i.e.
the courtrooms and law offices of the world... and find me some lawyers 
to play this game, before the NO lawyers game finishes!

<p>
Eric Ozog has cancelled the Air-Sea Diplomacy opening, at least for now.
It is possible that Buddy Tretick will locate another guest GM for this,
if you're interested, please contact Buddy.
Or if you don't do that, Buddy might organize a ``sample game'' - see
below.
I do have a copy of the rules as well.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper is the only one signed up for that.

<p>
Stephen Agar runs a British Diplomacy mailing list and has a new broader
web postal gaming web site too at: 
http://www.postalgames.org.uk

<p>
 and if you are interested, 
contact Stephen Agar at stephen of meurglys.com
or join the Brit hobby mailing list at (aw, you guessed it, another new address):

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The GATE draw, which would have closed the gate on this game, 
is rejected.
But, even GREATer than that was the GREAT draw, which also was
proposed.
But that didn't help it, it fails too.

<p>
2) I still have not heard from Bob Acheson about taking this position.
Thus, I am delaying the game to see if I can reach him.
If I can't reach Bob by next deadline, I will have to appoint another
replacement.
But as Randy readily admitted to me, he didn't pay attention to the
last season he played and NMRing the two builds would seem to unbalance
the continuation of the game.
So, we wait.
Sorry about that, guys!
To entertain you all, I will still print the Winter press.
Please feel VERY free to submit some more and note Bernie's 
proposal at the bottom.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(EL' STAB'O PRESS, MOSCOW): Well, there, Frenchman!  Do you see that the
Austria has grow tired of your participation, or lack of participation.
After all, did you really fall for them supporting you into Piedmont?  Not
to worry.  The new Turk, El Bob Himselflessness, now has to attack Austria
in a grand stab, not being able to trust the Austrian Hen, surely not after
seeing Austria stab a long ally.  Should have stayed with us, Rick.  You can
see we do not stab.  Now, then, Austria, care to make an alliance with us
against Turkey?  As you can see, we can take Austria out of the game, and
can not take out Turkey.  Why, then, does Turkey need Austria?

<p>
(VIENNA to BERLIN): What did I do to YOU to deserve such bitter 
declarations as ``No draws including A"?  You attacked me, not vice
versa....

<p>
(BERNIE TRETICK):
Why not run a dummy game of Air-Sea.  I would be happy to send in the moves.
And, you would encourage other players to monitor the game.  That should
stir interest.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Last time printing the rules..... get 'em straight, ask me
questions or be prepared to go hunt them up on the Web Page.
Let me know if any contact information is incorrect or out of date.
Phone numbers, where I am missing them??
Unless superceded below, all rules are as in regular Diplomacy.

<p>
2) The game lasts seven game years (measured Winter to Winter, 1901 to 1907), 
with each player rotating through the powers in alphabetical order (AEFGIRT),
playing each power for one game year.  At the end of each game
year, the game board and positions are fully reset to the initial
positions.

<p>
3) Initial Positions: All units and supply center ownership are as in
regular Diplomacy, except that each player has five nuclear weapons
(except for Russia which has only four nuclear weapons).

<p>
4) Firing Nuclear Weapons: Each nuclear weapon (nuke) is fired 
at a specific province (land or sea) according to 
orders submitted by their owners immediately FOLLOWING the Spring
moves (nuke orders are submitted with those moves and cannot be made
conditional on any outcomes or moves in the Spring turn).
Nuclear weapon strikes destroy the supply center in the targeted
province, if any, as well as any units in that province following
the Spring turn.

<p>
5) Effects of Nuclear Weapons (Black Hole Variant): The effects of
the nuclear weapon strike are equivalent to those in the Black
Hole variant designed by Conrad von Metzke (Conrad is the unofficial
ombudsman for adjudication of paradoxes caused by this rule).
Any provinces adjacent to a nuke strike province are now themselves
adjacent.
The effect of nuke strikes on adjacent provinces creates a cumulative
effect such that all provinces adjacent to an a contiguous string of
nuke strike provinces are all simultaneously adjacent.
This effect applies to moves, supports, retreats, and convoys.
Coastal provinces that are nuked transmit their coastal status to
all adjacent provinces, which also is cumulative in effect.
These coastal status changes do not interfere with any army supports,
retreats, or moves between two land provinces separated by
a contiguous string of nuke strike provinces.

<p>
6) Victory Conditions: The game ends at the end of the seventh winter
adjustment season.
Victory points are garnered by cumulatively adding supply centers owned
at the end of each of the seven game years.
The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.
Ties are broken by sequentially comparing victory points owned in
1907 followed by each preceding year.
Players earning precisely the same number of victory points in each
of the seven game years remain tied.

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HARRY AT SAT, 26 JAN 2002 21:43:37 EST):
<i>TAP</i>-253 arrived today. Please announce that the E-mail address of 
sarareichert of aol.com is as dead as my sex life.
Use &lt;harryandruschak of aol.com from now on.
[[What is it like to be totally impotent and totally without a sex drive 
after a lifetime of active sex? It does take some getting used to, which is 
why I am still seeing a counselor/therapist at least once a week. As is the 
case with many men castrated for control of prostate cancer (or taking Lupron 
which does almost the same thing chemically), I am bothered by hot flashes. 
Details on how I am coping with this problem are available on request.]]
As regard FARINELLI and countertenors, it has to be noted that there were 
countertenors in the Baroque era. It was noted by critics in that era that 
the countertenors did not have the range and power of the true Castrati. 
There was much more to the Castrati then the cruel pre-pubertal surgery. 
Thank God these training methods have been lost so that this sort of atrocity 
cannot happen again.
What happened to NYEED?  I thought it was supposed to start this issue.  Did 
I miss something? 
<i>((You're just blind too.... ;-) It was there, and here it is in more
complete form this issue.))</i>
 
<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): I don't think I would have any problems if the game 
started before 16 March. I had surgery on 18 January to remove the empty 
scrotum. (It looked ugly and felt funny.)  I have scheduled vacations for 10 
- 18 February, 1 - 14 June, and 5 - 18 October. However, I am also 
reaffirming that NYEED will remain my only PBM commitment, as I have no way 
of knowing when further medical problems may come up. Right now my biggest 
annoyance are the hot flashes that come every hour or so. I have bought a 
couple of plain wooden fans, size large, from http://www.ideco.com/ which are 
a real help. Life goes on, even as a eunuch. This includes anthrax scares and 
hoaxes at the Post Office where I work. And so it goes.

<p>
(RICH GORANSON): Comments about Harry no longer having the balls to play 
Diplomacy will most likely be ignored...
(who hopes he gets better soon)

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK to GORANSON): Now that was a cutting remark.

<p>
1) Here are all the stats and an endgame statement.
More are welcomed or perhaps demanded, don't be surprised if Goz will be calling 
you at work to demand one....

<p>
2) Those of you with balances (dollar figures in parentheses above) 
should let me know what they want done with their NMR insurance left over.
Default is that it gets applied to your subscriptions (if you're in another
game it will be added to that balance).

<p>
(FRENCH CAHAG EOG STATEMENT):

<p>
Jim Bob O Roonie,

<p>
Here is my EOG in all it's glory.  I was probably too modest and nice, but 
what the hell. :)

<p>
First, thanks Jim-Bob for running a great game.  A nice place you've got 
here. I cleaned my plate and fixed my bed.  You better check and make sure 
Barno didn't mess in the hall.

<p>
Second TO THE HATCHET JOB, BAT MAN!!

<p>
Jim Sayers (Germany) MY GOD MAN!!  We had a deal in the beginning of the game 
to kill England.  He did not want me to move to Burgundy. I said, DUDE! 
you've got to think I'm on crack cocaine to leave Burgundy open. I'm moving 
there WITH support.  

<p>
Then at the last second as a gesture of total good will, I opened to Picardy. 
I wrote Jim saying, ``See, what a great ally I am, no pressure on you bud!  
Smootch, smootch."  Then Jim writes me back and says ``you know what? You're out 
of position, so you better give me 3 builds or you can kiss my ass" Needless 
to say I ran, not walked, RAN back to England.  Thank God he took me back.

<p>
So it went.  Scott Munson (Italy) was a dirty rotten rat bastard, but he was 
MY dirty rotten rat bastard. I think he lied to me every other move, but 
never really hurt me.  When he moved his fleet through MAO to attack England 
I knew he wasn't all bad.

<p>
England and Germany were dying.   &lt; sniff, SOB &gt;  And the game was going 
swimmingly.  Austria and Italy were killing Russia and Turkey.  It looked 
like a 3 way.  Austria was begging Italy to stab me, I was begging Italy to 
stab Austria.  In the end he stabbed Austria.  Lucky me.

<p>
Of course he then vanished.  Good-bye Scott, hello Emmert.

<p>
My hand reached for the knife.  Truth be told I was setting up this stab for 
years before Emmert took over.  The fact he joined the game only made it more 
enjoyable......umm......errr... ... harder to write the orders. I met Emmert 
at one of those Dip Con's.  Ive seen his kind before, with a foot on the back 
of grandma, taking her few coins while he fondles her chickens.   &lt; sniff &gt;  I 
admire that in a man.

<p>
In the end, they SHOULD have stopped me.  All Kinney had to do was order 
Moscow to Warsaw supported by Galicia and I would have been stopped COLD at 
17.  Why did Kinnney instead support me into St.Pete?  WHO THE HELL KNOWS!!  
He never wrote me back.  Maybe he'll tell us, maybe he won't.

<p>
Despite this fact I take full fucking credit for the solo.  Sweet, sweet 
victory.  Ahhh, the beer tastes colder, the women are free and easy.  I do, 
however, feel gratitude, NO, that's too strong a word, let's say 
appreciation, NO WAIT! That's not it either, wait a second, it's coming to 
me, YES, I feel pity for the little people that helped me to this grand 
place.  I will honor your rotting, filthy corpse every year on my birthday 
when I bone a maiden from your country.

<p>
A shout out goes to Barno for his final move.  We thought Emmert would cut 
his heart out. (see above) but he didn't.  OOOPS.

<p>
SCREW YOU GUYS, I'm going home. (reference to South Park Cartman)

<p>
And if any of you guys ever want to visit my vast empire.  Feel free to come 
by and hear my watchman say,

<p>
``Sorry, folks, park's closed.  Moose out front shoulda told ya."

<p>
<i>((Mega thanks for a brilliant stream of consciousness style EOG!
Your bro' Goz will be on everyone's case to add to our enjoyment with
their contributions.
Scott Munson may be a rotten rat bastard, but he was OUR rotten rat 
bastard, and I really miss him.
Anyone heard from him lately?
He has to write an endgame statement too!!))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Be careful, Goz has gone damned militant on us.  
He be demanding endgame statements from ALL of you, even Doug Essinger-Hileman,
who disappeared before the game even started!!
Get 'em in now!!!
Naw, I don't really expect to hear from Doug Essinger-Hileman, but I do 
expect to hear from the rest of you!

<p>
2) Those of you with balances (dollar figures in parentheses above) 
should let me know what they want done with their NMR insurance left over.
Default is that it gets applied to your subscriptions (if you're in another
game it will be added to that balance).

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DANA - ALICE):  I'll bet you play a BIG card this round.

<p>
(WHITE MAID to ERIC): Are we both awake now?  Shall we go grab some
points at 80 km?

<p>
(EDI - DANA):  And I'll bet I play a little one!

<p>
(TOM to BOOB AND ERIC): So, which one of you guys is going to get a film
crew on that Sidney bound cruise ship with Peery, et al?
<i>((Not me, see Larry's more detailed account of the last cruise in
the forthcoming <b>Diplomacy World</b>, should be out very, very shortly.))</i>

<p>
(JOHN): Not got time to give my thoughts on ``Lord of the Rings" except to 
say number one son (aged 11) saw it twice on successive days so must have been 
impressed.  I thought it was merely OK, not a travesty of the book but 
nowhere near as rich an experience despite the fantastic scenery.
<i>((We seem to have agreed.
See some more discussion on that up above.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/
currently is on hiatus.
I'll try to remember to let you know when it returns.

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.....

<p>
3) Gosh, I've seldom seen as precipitous a drop in centers as Eric
has been experiencing, unless it is the drop that Kent Pollard 
experienced earlier in this game.
Eric survives.... barely.

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``You all have died, though you're still alive,
soon the pirate ships will be in!''
One of the only parts of ``The Song of Dogs'' reasonably appropriate
for a family szine, off of the rude and crude <i>Pussy, King of the Pirates</i>,
the Mekons' collaboration with Kathy Acker.

<p>
(UKRAINE - GERMANY):  Round and round and round we go.

<p>
(VOICE OF THE GREATER REICH to WHOMSOEVER):  What's that about Tribbles?
I haven't even THOUGHT about them in decades....  Oh, that Ukr armies
are lying everywhere one looks?  Yeah, I've noticed THAT.

<p>
(UKRAINE - EGYPT):  I kept asking Spain for a Rams offense, but seems he must be
a Patriots fan.  We'll do it his way.

<p>
(CAPTAIN KIRK to THE KLINGON HIGH COMMAND): You are about to occupy the
Ferengi Holy City, home of the ``divine'' treasury.
While the Ferengi lust for money has no real relationship to any
rational faith or religion, you must not violate the treasury or its
anointed leader.
To do so would bring dishonor to the Klingon people and would have a 
destabilizing effect on future political negotiations with other warring
governments.
PS: I hear the Ferengi women aren't allowed to wear clothing.
Try not to throw up at the sight, Kirk out.

<p>
(JOHN SCHULTZ): No time to chit chat.  Just bought a house.  My life is slowly 
winding down into normality.

<p>
(BOOB to JOHN): All great to hear!  Let me know when your address changes!

<p>
(UKRAINE - SPAIN):  I'm following your lead.

<p>
(JEFF to THE WORLD): I hate to admit being this out of touch, but I went to
see ``Lord of the Rings'' last week.
I was under the mistaken impression that it was the Harry Potter movie.
I think all those years I spent in the paint store around oil base
paint has fried my brain.

<p>
(UKRAINE - GERMANY):  Scary, ain't it?

<p>
(CAPTAIN KIRK to ROMULAN HIGH COMMAND): For their help in defending
the Federation against her enemies, I have negotiated a deal with the
Klingons.
They get all of Ferengi now.
I get Deep Space 7 in the next battle cycle and Deep Space 8 the
cycle after that.

<p>
1) Free rides are over.... you can get me End Game Statements if you like,
but this one is finally disappearing from the pages of <i>TAP</i> next issue
unless I get at least one.
Thanks to everyone for the game and the patience.
New Miller Number Custodian Dan Mathias, please take note!
Also, apologies for not using the ``official'' game years.  I found
them too confusing for me, so we started with 1901, like regular Diplomacy.
