<br /><br />It's time for another Jim-Bob plea.... you all know that John Caruso continues
to run his baseball league for all of us who REALLY hate Rotisserie style
Baseball Leagues because they don't actually PLAY any games, but really like
the competition and comradery of that type of league.
Also, for all of you who are United fans, this league has some similar 
characteristics.
Finally, the actual PLAYERS are the real players in baseball, and they stay in 
our league until they are out of baseball, then they retire.
This also makes it fun that as you plan your team, you have to plan how long
players in baseball will remain active.
We are short SIX players and John says no one cares about him or his style of league
any more.
While this is just John being John,
prove him wrong, join up.
I think we will need to get ALL six willing to join since John is going to
put one &#252;nowned" team in each division and he wants it to be fair.
We're entirely an E-Mail league now, so there are not the high game fees that 
scared people off in the past.
I know some former league members are out there, and I'm also sure that new
league members are out there.
Just ask me, and I'll E-Mail you the kind of information you get during the
season to track your teams.
Please, we must have SIX people out there who are interested!!
I can threaten to shut down <i>TAP</i> if people don't volunteer.
That usually wakes people up.

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

BUT, the site has not been updated in recent times.
If you want to follow me and others in John Caruso's Baseball League,
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-P Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings, once he gets back from the 
vacation that he's on right now.
Really, you can.
And Dick himself is lonely and he hangs out there even more
than John does, make Dick Martin's day, go to phantomempire!
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can start RIGHT NOW to pick up one of
the unclaimed teams and play it this year!
My team is still heading toward the playoffs, continuing 
to lead my division over the likes of Dicko's Baltimore Oriole team.
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Sylvain played a LOT of FTF all up and down the East Coast back

Let's get Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski, Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your

What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au

<br /><br /><b>Doug Kent, former <i>Diplomacy World</i> Editor (08-05-04)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim, Dave Partridge was kind enough to send me copies of 
<i>DW</i> #89 and #90.
<b>Please</b>, if you could, thank him for me.
<i>((Here we are, thanks, Dave!!!))</i>
It motivated me to write this LOC, and perhaps in the next
month or so an article or two (but it'll have to be in
handwritten form).
<i>((No problem, I decided to print your LOC here in 
<i>TAP</i> for a number of reasons, first because this next issue
#91 coming out in the next few days is going to be huge already.
Plus, then I can provide my comments here and I can do the typing
and then Tim can respond if he wants to.
Also, I think the audience for your comments is the postal people
who are more prevalent here, than with the current readership of
<b>DW</b>.
I'll provide some input from Tim Haffey at points
that I've already received from our discussions below as well.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So let me see what comments I can make on these issues.
Do you remember what issues I published?
I think #72 to #81 or #82?
<i>((That's about right... something like that.))</i>
There's an obvious barometer of the postal hobby - only
7 or 8 issues published since my last in 1998.
<i>((Yes, but we will get all four issues published in 2004, so
I think we're back on a roll....))</i>
It's sad, because I don't see how the various web factions will
ever build the kind of community feeling the postal hobby had...
which is the part I really miss.
<i>((Wrongo, Flap Jack breath.
The community feeling has been building over the last half decade 
and it is starting to feel like that of earlier times.
Across the country in the US, and also elsewhere in the world
(especially France, as you'll read in #91), there has been an
explosion of FTF get-togethers.
And some of the web sites, listserves, and discussion groups
are getting a lot of that old time community feel.
I will agree that it isn't there yet, but the possibility is there.
And a lot of people (many of whom are reading these words) are
working to help make it happen.
What is more exciting to me is the worldwide nature of that community
feel.
I feel much closer to dippers in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland,
Germany, France, Belgium, Ireland, the UK, Canada, and so on
than I ever did going back 25 years.
Disappointingly, the NZ-Aussie hobby seems to be in a bit of a 
slump, but that's the only downer I see.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General comments on the printed version: I don't know what kind
of circulation it still has.
<i>((Well, there are about 300 web/E-Mail subscribers and others
who read it on the web from general announcements.
But, the postal version is pretty limited, I think Dave is sending
it to somewhere between 10-20 people, mostly old time postal types
and former editors like yourself.))</i>
I wouldn't mind seeing a tighter layout, smaller print, and less
pages.
I don't know what copy costs are these days, but pages could be
saved.
Of course, part of the complexity seems to be that the zine
is now designed as a web zine, with a print version adapted
from that.
My issues were developed in the opposite way, because of my
personal hobby focus.
<i>((Well, sort of.
It really is that no one on the editorial board currently is
spending much time trying to improve the layout.
I've always been much more of a content over form guy myself
(you all know that reading this szine) and Tim Haffey is
adjusting to how he wants to do the layout.
I would expect further adjustments in the next two issues or so.
But it is NOT a web szine in the sense of <b>The Diplomatic
Pouch</b> which is composed in html from the beginning.
So there is nothing preventing the page layout from improving
along the lines you suggest.
Tim may want to respond further, but he didn't seem that concerned
when I mentioned it, and I'm not that concerned either.
Dave Partridge may want to complain.... ;-)
But thanks for the comment.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm out of touch with a lot of the things discussed.
I know what Judge is, although I've never used it.
Things like NADF Masterpoints are meaningless to me.
<i>((You SURELY must remember Buz Eddy, and he is working
the North American Diplomacy Federation Masterpoints deal.))</i>
Diplo is, I assume, an automated adjudication program.
<i>((Correct.))</i>
I prefer to do that manually, so I can "feel" how 
the results are built from the moves.
Even the occasional error is more than made up for by the extra
enjoyment adjudication gives me.
<i>((Amen.
This to me, is the only reason to GM games and is the only way you
can REALLY follow them.
There is still a pretty fair following for manual adjudication
around, even on E-Mail games.
I also argue that it is the best way to keep your tactical 
chops up.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The biggest problem with <i>DW</i> remains as it always has been -
lack of contributors.
That will never change.
When the zine was postal, you could coax articles a little easier
by offering a free issue for each submission used.
Plus when I was publishing, the combination of my zine, 
a barrage of emails, posts to Compuserve and AOL forums,
plus a post to rec.games.diplomacy would usually
generate enough material.
Then ads to those same areas would result in some new
subscribers.
When I could, I offered a free sample to newcomers.
Nowadays, with the web, what can you offer as a reward to writers?
There is also a thrill to seeing your name in print,
one which I don't find equalled when your name is on a web page.
At any rate, I'll do my best to provide an article here or there.
<i>((Thanks, I'm not sure I have an answer for you, I basically
agree with you.
We've probably not been as aggressive as we might in publicizing
the <b>DW</b> rebirth.
But I think we're doing OK, given that.
The reward issue is difficult.
One's name is in print, of course, this way, but I agree that it
isn't the same.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Are my old issues still available on the web?
Perhaps each issue of <i>DW</i> could contain a single "old"
article, from <i>DW</i> days gone by, not necessarily from
my period either.
Some would have to be retyped, but I feel that providing
a sense of hobby history helps develop more of the commonality
feeling.
Just a thought.
Or maybe the modern-day Diplomacy player doesn't much care
about that kind of thing.
I don't have a real basis to judge.
<i>((Most of your original old issue material is still
available on the web, yes.
What we are PLANNING to do is to put up ALL of the old <b>DW</b>'s
eventually on the web.
If I were more organized, and I don't even have all of MY old
issues on the web yet, I'd do it myself.
I do not think it's such a good idea to publish old articles,
and we wouldn't have to retype most of them, I think we should
keep producing new material.
But I do think we should encourage the looks to the past,
and I always do that.
There may be something in all this that is usable, but I think putting
the former issues up on the web should be first.
Stephen Agar volunteered to do that, and I think he will, someday.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Okay, I'll run through each issue and offer my own brief thoughts.
Issue 89.
I think the "Message from Jim Burgess" might be a little bit better
used if cut into two parts - the personal message/comment section,
and a Hobby News section, and listed as such.
<i>((You're absolutely right, of course, I really meant it to be the
two pieces and Tim just put it together that way.
We can do better with titles than "Message from" in any case.))</i>
I enjoyed Tim's editorial, and all three S&amp;T articles that followed.
Fishburne's article in particular I might write a response to, although
I'm not sure how many issues you want to publish Austria articles in.
<i>((Oh, go for it.
In my view, way too many people in the current hobby are anti-Austria or
anti-Italy since they think these powers can't win, or are too 
disadvantaged by their location.
I completely disagree, of course, so articles in that direction 
would be welcome, I think.
You wouldn't be saying that Austria is an impossible country to play,
would you??))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm forever partial to interview articles with hobby figures, so of course I
devoured the Agar interview.
I would have preferred smaller type and, in exchange, two more pages!
Maybe that's my personal viewpoint solely.
<i>((Nah, the smaller type is really a general issue that eventually
we might get a handle on, we probably still need a good final copyeditor,
perhaps when you get active again we can prevail on you to do that final
organization.
It's kinda thankless, as you know....
in general, of course, I intend to keep doing an interview in each issue.
I've got many, many, many people left to interview.
Any volunteers?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As I know nothing about "Age of Imperialism" I found Fred Davis' article
a little hard going. 
And the typos made it more difficult to follow.
A diagram of the map might have helped, because without it the last three
pages of the review were useless for me.... I'm not very good at
visualization.
<i>((Well, as you saw from the next issue, that whole thing was a bit of a fiasco.
It just didn't work so well, sorry Fred!!
This was part of incomplete communication between writers, editors, and layout
that I think we're trying to fix.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I suppose the fact that I wasn't going didn't help, but 15 pages on Dipcon
scoring systems, rules, and schedules was tedious reading.
This looks to me to be a good example of the difficulties in adapting
a web zine to printed format.
It's probably not necessary to include every word from one in the other.
In fact, perhaps there are ways to encourage the printed format a bit
by including an article here and there which doesn't initially 
appear in the web version.
I like the print version because it can be given away, left at a local
game store, etc. when you're done with it.
<i>((OK, let's see, lots of points here.
Yes, I think we got some tedious stuff in there, I think this will work out,
but this is NOT a webszine in the classic sense.
A webszine has a TOC, and then you link to each page, and you try to make
sure every article fits on no more than about two screens.
Each article is in some sense a "standalone".
But we mean this to continue to be an individual whole, it isn't quite there yet,
but it may be soon.
I don't want to (up to Tim if he wants to) separate web/print editions.
First of all, web distribution of the document is going to be the primary
way the szine is distributed.
Second, it really doesn't make any sense, except as a gimmick, to
have the print version "lead" any articles over the web.
As the entire publishing industry moves in this direction it is
ALWAYS the reverse, that a web/E-Mail edition leads the print version.
I do think leaving print editions lying around is a good idea though.))</i>

#90.
I enjoyed both the Dipcon report and the Demo game.
I love Demo games!
Who is writing the commentary for this game?
<i>((I think that's Tim Haffey, isn't it??
I'm playing in this game, so in an editorial sense I'm trying to be
VERY hands off, not always successfully.))</i>
The formation of a Yahoo group is a good idea.
The face-to-face game report later in the issue was also
a fun read.
I've never seen Edi's "Teaching Diplomacy" before, but I think it's
a useful tool.
<i>((As do I, that needs to be spread around freely and separately.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It sounds like part of the problem Tim is having attracting articles, 
askide from the normal trouble we've all encountered, is he
has no stable of contacts to call on.
That isn't his fault, not at all.
It's just the situation.
If <i>DW</i> is still around when I get home (late next year)
I'll do what I can to help the cause.
<i>((I think it is very important to see that the ONE thing
that Tim is doing that is the best thing in the long run, is to
JUST PUBLISH IT.
This next issue will continue a smooth upward improvement in quality.
As long as it's improving that will attract more readership and
more articles.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A few ideas or things I miss.
One is a more discussion-oriented column a-la <i>Foolhardy</i> -
write up an interesting question, collect the responses, and
edit them down some if necessary.
Second is something Avalon Hill's <i>The General</i> always did,
and Jack McHugh tried to do in one issue - a "rate the issue"
section, where people mail in or email a rating of each portion of
the zine.
Finally, I always found the "international/report" stuff
fascinating - try to get one person from any country that
has a Dip hobby to write a paragraph on their hobby news for
each issue.
That took work, a lot of badgering, but when it came off,
I enjoyed it.
<i>((Good ideas all, if someone wants to pick one or more of them
up, I'm sure Tim would be overjoyed.
I'm most likely to pick up the last one myself, but I'd
rather interview people from other countries.
We have a French interview coming up in the latest
#91 that I just finished, really good stuff!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I know the multi-editor cooperation can be cumbersome, a case
in point all the problems with format discussed by Jim in the 
letter column of #90, but I see no solution if one person
doesn't want to do the whole thing themselves.
I know proofreading, format, etc. all suffered when Jack
and I did two issues together.
It wasn't until the whole thing became my sole responsibility
that it took shape.
<i>((Which is why I'm trying to let Tim have that responsibility
and run with it.... I just want to write and proofread.))</i>
Also with multiple editors it's harder to have a personal flavor.
Again this is just an observation, because there is no way to solve
the problem unless there is one person who wants to do the zine
all by themselves, which right now seems to be a luxury the
hobby cannot afford.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm glad <i>DW</i> continues even despite all these difficulties,
and I'll do my best to contribute how and when I can, now
and in the future.
Keep up the good work!

<br /><br /><b>Tim Richardson (Fri, 20 Aug 2004 16:42:21 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Potomac Tea &amp; Knife Society (PTKS), like many gamers, was affected by 
the decision of the Boardgame Players Association (BPA), to move its 
largest event, the World Boardgaming Championships (WBC), from Hunt Valley, 
Maryland just outside Baltimore to Lancaster County in the heart of 
Pennsylvania Dutch Country.  However, as the PTKS is the host of the 
Fifteenth Annual World Diplomacy Championships (WDC XV) in 2005 an event 
that was planned in conjunction with WBC, this affects Diplomacy players 
much more than other gamers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Diplomacy has always been a part of WBC and its predecessor AvalonCon.  For 
many years, WBC was masterfully run by Hobby legend Jim Yerkey, who served 
as the Tournament Director for the Tenth World Diplomacy Championship (WDC 
X) in 2000, one of the best attended WDC's in the event's fourteen year 
history.  Last year, Jim Yerkey stepped down as Director of the WBC 
Diplomacy tournament and turned responsibility for the event over to the 
PTKS, which moved its Tempest in a Teapot event from Washington, D.C. in 
October to Hunt Valley, MD in August.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When the Hobby awarded WDC XV to the PTKS at the 2003 meeting of the World 
DipCon Society in Denver, Colorado, it did so with the understanding that 
the PTKS would host the event in late July/early August 2005 in conjunction 
with WBC at the same location that played host to WDC X.  The venue was 
known to most of the Hobbyists that attended that meeting of the World 
DipCon Society, and, more specifically, to the overseas players.  The 
decision of the BPA-upon which the PTKS had no input or notice-to move 
their largest event to a venue which is not as accessible to players 
traveling internationally was of great concern to the PTKS.  So much so 
that the PTKS Executive Board has decided to separate WDC XV from WBC 
because we strongly believe that the venue change will have an adverse 
effect on the decision of overseas players and because we presented a bid 
to the Hobby to host the World Diplomacy Championships in the greater 
Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This does not reflect any anger or disagreement with the decision of BPA to 
change its venue.  Most PTKSers and many Diplomacy players are members of 
BPA and look forward to attending WBC in its new home.  The PTKS values its 
relationship with BPA and WBC-and we will continue to run the Diplomacy 
tournament at that event.  But we did not feel that we could host the kind 
of event that the Hobby expects unless we moved WDC to a different venue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At this time, the PTKS Executive Board is actively reviewing specific 
options for WDC XV.  We are committed to holding this event in July 2005 in 
the greater Washington, D.C. area.  It is our hope that we will be able to 
plan our event for a weekend when our international travelers will also be 
able to plan to attend another North American Diplomacy or other gaming 
event on the following or preceding weekend of WDC XV.  We expect that a 
decision will be made in a very short time frame, as we have already 
reviewed some very attractive venues for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We expect to be able to make an announcement in a very short period of 
time.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the PTKS 
Captain-elect Ike Porter (ike of manor.org), Director of Tournaments Andy 
Marshall (landruajm of yahoo.com), or me, Tim Richardson (timrich of diplom.org).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Until then, keep your knives sharp for WDC XV!!!

<br /><br /> <b>Bob Holt (July 4-6, 2004)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Well I figured it was even money that the post office was closed today on July 5.  
The answer is yes, it was.  As a result you get a longer, yet probably more coherent letter.
<i>((But that doesn't mean I can get it into the szine with my disorganized
mail pile.... sorry about the delay, but here we are, finally.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First of all, before I get too involved with the music side, 
I checked out some of the variant rules, and I'm most interested 
in playing in the Modern game you're thinking about starting, so please sign me up. 
Now on to the more/less important stuff:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was looking back through some of your older issues (190-209 at this point), 
and it got me thinking about some of the music I've been listening to lately.  
I don't know what you or your general readership would think about this stuff, 
but I like it, and that's what matters, right?  
<i>((Absopositivelutely!))</i>
I would have written you an email, but I figured a letter would actually 
get to your house before the next time I'm online.  
<i>((This was not helped by my long delay in publishing it.... sigh.
Sorry, again.))</i>
Now, whether or not you're also there is a different matter.  
The really handy part is that I even have a couple of days to edit 
and add to my letter before the mail gets picked up again.
I didn't start this intending to send it to you for print in <i>TAP</i>, 
but after getting this all down and looking at some of your more recent 
issues, it looks like you're begging for music reviews.  
<i>((That's right, I want more of them, it also gets me going.
I want to review the two new Los Lobos records and the freshness of
the band Enter the Haggis (neat name, too!) but without other people
writing, I don't have the push.))</i>
Additionally, as a new subber, I guess I should get used to 
fulfilling my duty of being an active contributor.  
Feel free to break it up/print this as you see fit.  
I've got a copy on the ol' hard-drive if you want a soft version.  
<i>((I did request and get that, but it was hardly an excuse for
the long delay.... everyone bored by the mea culpa's yet??))</i>
I don't know if any of my musical favorites have shown up in 
your letters/reviews/whatever prior to now.  
I did a cursory search through some of the more recent issues 
(nothing more than ctrl-F, looking for artists) 
and didn't find some of what I'm recommending.  
<i>((No problem, you can mention things we've mentioned.
I'll let you know if something in here has been talked about before...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Having never done any kind of music review, 
I've had actually come up with an interesting twist on the 
"Top XX" list (if I don't say so, myself).  
I am, at least, fairly confident that I haven't intentionally 
stolen this idea from anybody.  This is mostly a reaction to the 
fact that I haven't been buying much current music in the past couple of years.  
I've been mostly filling up on my "required" backlog, 
lately springing for some Otis Redding.  
Anyway, here begins my "Top XX of 20XX" (i.e. Top 03 of 2003, or top 10 of 2010.
<i>((Nope, I've not seen the idea yet, so go for it!!!))</i>  
I'm really not expecting to get to any number too ridiculous 
as time wears on, since I've got more than a two decade 
head start on the list.)  So, as this is the 
first place I've compiled this list, here goes:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2000 (And I'm already cheating, giving you a recommendation 
when I should give you nothing!  
Let's pretend it came out in 2001, since I don't have a recommendation there.):  
Although I generally remember 2000 as being a musical wasteland, 
I can't just let this year go by without a mention of a 
beautifully tormented album:  Twilight Singers, <i>Twilight</i>, 2000 (Columbia/Sony).  
The album features the sweet smoothness of Greg Dulli's (Afghan Whigs) 
vocals, which seems like a sick joke designed to get us 
to ignore the searing pain of heartbreaking loss the entire 
album depicts with lyrics that can hardly be portrayed as subtle.  
The overall sound is so gentle, relaxing, and dare-I-say seductive, 
that it's easy to pop this in as background/mood music without 
considering the subconscious turmoil you're probably putting yourself through.  
Dulli wrote or co-wrote every track, co-produced, 
and mixed the album, which certainly adds to the sense that 
the music is going straight from his soul to your ears.  
I've been a big fan of the very little Afghan Whigs 
stuff I've listened to (pretty much a single, "Lost in the Supermarket," 
<i>((You go, I know this song of course, but nothing else of the Afghan Whigs,
and have not heard anything of Dulli....))</i>
and their 1998 release 1965.), and would definitely 
not be averse to picking up more of their stuff.  
Also, the Twilight Singers have a 2003 (I think) release 
that I haven't picked up yet.  I'll probably rectify that tomorrow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2001:  Just one, and I can't begin to figure it out.  
I may have to cheat and look back at some of your <i>TAP</i> back 
issues for reminders.  I may not even have an album from 2001 
in my possession.  Maybe that was one of those years where 
I did nothing but buy older stuff.
<i>((You can talk about older stuff, you know.
I buy and listen to a lot of older stuff too, and sometimes (frequently)
look forward to comeback albums by people who should be... almost anyway...
dead.
The record in that class I'm currently awaiting (and I don't care about
the groans from the peanut gallery) is the new Chad and Jeremy record
that might come out late this year.  Now THAT goes back.
Everyone who doesn't even remember who Chad and Jeremy were may go back
in their hole and return to Bob's recommendations....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2002:  I think I'm going to slip Mark Knopfler, The 
Ragpicker's Dream, (Warner Bros.) in here.  
I really don't even know where to begin here.  
It's just a great listenable album from the awesome Mark Knopfler 
(Dire Straits).  Knopfler's guitar stylings and eerie voice 
on the opening track "Why Aye Man" could easily have been 
slipped onto Dire Straits' <i>Brothers In Arms</i> with nobody noticing.  
The feel continues through the rest of the album with 
guitar-work that is both agile and ephemeral and 
Knopfler's unmistakable lilting baritone.  
"A Place Where We Used to Live" is a sweet jazz shuffle 
(bossa nova? - I'm not really up on my jazz styles) 
that highlights Knopfler's preferred vocal range.  
My senior-citizen uncle actually introduced me to 
this album before I had a chance to pick it up, 
which embarrasses me slightly, but not too much.  
All I can really say is that this makes great background 
music, but Knopfler's lyrics stand up to the burden of an 
in-depth analysis, which I will avoid here.  
I understand that Knopfler has been concentrating more 
on film scores and such in recent years.  
This is a wonderful solo offering that should be in anybody's collection.
<i>((There's nothing necessarily wrong with moving over
into film scores.
The late, great Michael Kamen was one of my favorite film score
producers, and I first adored him in my youth from his work
with the NY Rock and Roll Ensemble, whose music really does
stand the test of time.
Also, Michael's memory is being saluted through a foundation
started from the movie <i>Mr. Holland's Opus</i> that he worked
on with Richard Dreyfuss.
It is a crime of major proportions that music in our schools is
dying a horrific death.
We are raising generations of children without even a rudimentary
musical grounding, let alone the access to singing and instruments
that will make them healthy artistic adults.
I think you can get more information at www.michaelkamen.com.
Also, pick up one of the old NY Rock and Roll Ensemble records
if you get a chance.... oh, yeah, we've never talked about THAT
Knopfler record, but we've talked about him before here.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On a side note, I was in Strawberries yesterday and listened 
to portions of Richard Thompson's 2003 release <i>The Old Kit Bag</i>, 
which I only checked out based on what I read about him in <i>TAP</i>, 
and although I made the difficult decision to put it down in favor 
of <i>Must I Paint You A Picture?: The Essential Billy Bragg</i> 
(another artist I first heard about in <i>TAP</i>), 
I intend to pick it up in the near future, and based on my preview, 
I think I'll like that in much the same way I like Mark Knopfler.
<i>((Well, OK, Billy Bragg is a lot of fun, but he really isn't
in the same class as Ghod....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A3 (a.k.a. Alabama 3 in the U.K.), <i>Power In The Blood</i>, (One Little Indian).  
You'll find Alabama 3 mentioned again in my favorite albums of the 1990's 
(found later in this letter).  Their 1997 release, <i>Exile on Coldharbour Lane</i>, 
went largely unnoticed in the United States (and in the UK, for all I know).  
<i>((I think that's fair, I admit I've never heard of them.
This is undoubtedly my failing...))</i>
Their largest stateside hit is of course, "Woke Up This Morning," 
the ubiquitous title theme of HBO's <i>The Sopranos</i>.  
<i>((Hmmm, who or what are they??
No, I am dimly aware, and I've seen part of two or three episodes,
but they really bored me.
I don't know what the fuss is about.
And as such, I can't visualize (audialize) the theme.))</i>
A3 plays a genre they identify as "Country-Acidhouse."  
<i>((Ah, THAT sounds interesting, as the Mekons have 
had "country" leanings at times, as have some other 
very interesting bands to me over time.))</i>
The whole idea is a gimmick with the vocalists 
(Larry Love and The Very Rev. D. Wayne Love) putting on 
overly exaggerated rural southern accents, and singing over 
techno tracks filled with plenty of harmonica and fiddle.  
Amazingly enough, they pull the gimmick off, and have done so 
for at least 3 albums and a couple of movie-soundtrack singles.  
From top to bottom, <i>Power In The Blood</i> is a consistently 
well-done album with very few (if any) low points.  
A3 is at their best when either describing either the seedy underbelly 
of their environment or subtly calling for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, 
and the tracks dealing with the troubles of the unfortunate, 
loss, or drugs ("Lord Have Mercy," "The Moon Has Lost The Sun," and 
"The Devil Went Down to Ibiza," respectively) tend to be their best tracks.  
<i>((Ah, well then I can't possibly imagine they aren't treading in 
the tracks of the Mekons, then.
Nope, can't be possible.))</i>
The other standout tracks on this album are the title track, 
"Power In The Blood," and "Woody Guthrie," a song reflecting 
discontent with the governments of both the U.S. and U.K.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Biggest disappointment of 2002:  Audioslave, <i>Audioslave</i>, (Epic/Interscope).  
How dare Rick Rubin let this out of the studio?  
The promise of hearing Rage Against the Machine's band 
with Chris Cornell's (Soundgarden) vocals probably set the bar 
WAY too high to ever be reached.  I would have just let it slide, though, 
if the opening track/first single, "Cochise" didn't show so much promise.  
That track was exactly I was looking for from this merging of two great 
90's alt-rap-rock-whatever sounds.  
<i>((Since I was not much of a fan of the originals, I wouldn't have
had any real expectations, but that's just me.....))</i>
Like four proverbial horsemen, they arrived with a sound 
completely recognizable yet wholly unheard-of-before.  
Unfortunately, as the album played on, 
this turned into an unholy alliance, which effectively 
watered down the potential the band brought to the studio.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2003:  Okay, here it's easy.  Kenna, <i>New Sacred Cow</i>, (Columbia); 
Outkast, <i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i>, (Arista), 
Evanescence, <i>Fallen</i>, (Wind-up).  
I know I may suck at life for recommending those last two, but hear me out.  
<i>((I'm easy, so I'll give you a chance, but I hadn't heard of
the first one until just now and really like it as a new find
due to you, and can't stand the latter two..... but go for it!!!))</i>
First though, Kenna:  This may be the best post-1976 album ever.  
EVER.  It is unlike anything I have ever heard, 
but then again, I may not get out much.  
I first got turned on to this around last July/August at the Avalon 
in Boston, where Kenna opened for Dave Gahan (lead singer of Depeche Mode, 
of whom/which I'm not a fan, but you go where the (now ex) girl says to go).  
This was the biggest and best surprise that I have ever had 
at a live show, and consequently my vote for best show of 2003.  
<i>((Oh yes, that sparks a bit of a memory, I DID hear someone else
say something like that about Kenna... but I'd forgotten until you mentioned
it and sent along the CD!!!))</i>
Imagine, if you will, highly rhythmic electronic 
music that still retains a sense of melody.  
Add on to this, smooth soul vocals coming out of a skinny 
black man wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars and ceaselessly 
doing variations of the Robot on stage.  
His backup band, of course, are two kids who look like they 
came straight out of the film version of <i>The Neverending Story</i>, 
went to RISD, and dropped out to join Kenna's road band.  
Not that there's anything wrong with that.  
It's just that I'm hoping that conjures up some kind of mental image.  
<i>((Yup, and the band is as utterly original as about anything else
I've heard this millennium; however, there were LOTS of people in the
late 1980's sounding like parts of this.
What I really like is the rhythmic synthesizer effects mixed with what
had better be an acoustic piano and some really interesting vocals
that show that it is possible to have inventive lyrical structures.))</i>
On the album, Kenna plays all of the parts and 
fills in all of the vocals, much like Seal 
(at least in the early days.  Is he still a one-man recording machine?).  
In fact, now that I mention it, it's a lot like a 
highly electronic and more upbeat Seal.  
The album is produced by Chase Chad of the Neptunes, 
which should mean something more to me, but it unfortunately doesn't.  
A video or two got some play on MTV2, and you've actually probably 
heard snippets in TV promos for whatever.  
My recommendation would be to go buy this album NOW 
(except for the fact that I've included one with 
this letter on the feeling that you hadn't heard it.  
If you have, please send it back so that I can share it with someone else!).
<i>((I awarded you lots and lots of free issues for it....))</i>  
I actually saw 2 copies on the used shelf at Strawberries on 
Rt. 2 in Warwick and had to rescue them.  
I've got one for you and one for Dave Maletsky, 
to whom I also recommended the album.  
As a side-note, I'm listening to the album right now.  
Definitely either turn it way up, or wear headphones, 
because after a year of having this in heavy rotation, 
I'm still hearing new things as I type.
<i>((Some of the music didn't really grab me entirely, especially
after only two or three listenings, but "Hell Bent" and the
"War in Me" are scary in a not lightly mentioned Ian Curtis sort
of way.
There is more than a bit of "I've Lost Control Again" in here.
But there also is a new agey sort of psychology in this too, where
"A Better Control" is one of my favorites, a triple entendre -
and a economist/psych dream.
You have ALMOST made up for what follows, almost....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Outkast.  I'd like to pretend that this double solo album 
will convince people that don't like rap/hip-hop 
because it's not "real music" that they're wrong, but it won't.  
It should, but it won't.  
<i>((So you say, it hasn't convinced me.
Even within rap/hip-hop Outkast still comes across as hopelessly
derivative and uninteresting.))</i>
I know everybody has jumped on the bandwagon, 
but I can't help but like these guys.  
I DID live in Atlanta (the A-T-L) for over six years, 
and you were pretty much issued their albums in the 
mail with little boxes of Tide 
(I know, I stole the joke 
(which previously referred to Frampton Comes Alive), so sue me).  
<i>((No thanks, Frampton is/was hopelessly derivative and uninteresting too.))</i>
Anyway, I know the commercial FM/UHF/VHF/Cable/Satellite 
waves have been saturated with the popular singles 
"Hey Ya!", and "The Way You Move."  
While I whole-heartedly recommend a top-to-bottom 
listen of both discs, I'll honestly say that if you 
didn't like the singles, don't even bother 
(unless you just thought they were too poppy), 
because they are some of the lighter highlights 
of both Andre and Big Boi's offerings.  
<i>((Good, I didn't, so I won't.... I
don't mean to be hard on you, you should keep
going, I just think that rap/hip-hop outlived
its usefulness at least a decade ago.))</i>
Outkast has always drawn from hip-hop's roots, 
but this album outdoes everything they have ever 
pressed.  Andre3000's The Love Below opens with a 
jazzy intro with the tracks "The Love Below" and 
"Love Hater," and is rich with jazz and 
Motown cues throughout.  
Big Boi, on the other hand, draws more from 
influences ranging from Motown to funk, especially on 
"Bowtie" in which if I don't hear some 
George-Clinton-esque reference to Sir Nose D'Void of Funk, 
then there should be one.  
Other highlights (or at least my favorites) on this disc are
"Church" and "Flip Flop Rock," and "Last Call." 
Of course, both discs get harder as they go on, 
with Big Boi starting earlier and venturing farther 
down the path of "gangsta' rap," while still avoiding the typical.  
The usual cast of supporting characters is here, 
including longtime collaborator Killer Mike, 
Ludacris, Jay-Z, Sleepy Brown, Cee-Lo, Lil' Jon (What! Ye-ah! Okay!).  
Honestly, Big Boi needs the help in keeping a 
whole album moving, but taken together the 
entire double-album trumps anything Outkast has put on the market to date.  
Casual listeners of hip-hop will certainly appreciate The Love Below 
much more than Speakerboxxx, but that's part of why this 
album has such a wide following:  there's a sound somewhere that appeals to you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Evanescence.  I'm not even going to justify this.  
<i>((Good.... ;-) At least you started this off really well!!!))</i>
It's pop disguised as hard rock/metal, but I can't help 
but be moved by Amy Lee's voice - so much so that 
I can listen to this album ad infinitum.  
<i>((Well, that's OK, when you do fall in love with a female
vocalist, you fall in love with a female vocalist.))</i>
I typically am not a fan of female vocalists, 
but there are a few notable exceptions, including 
Shirley Manson (Garbage), Sarah McLachlan, and Amy Lee.  
The instrumentals are actually pretty darn good, but it's WAY 
overproduced, so it leaves a taste like processed 
cheese in your mouth, but I happen to like processed cheese, and 
will continue to eat it as long as I do, 
especially grilled between two lovely slices of bread with mayonnaise  
where was I?
<i>((Stuck on Amy Lee....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The biggest disappointment of 2003 was Metallica's <i>St. Anger</i>.  
I will now cease to recognize its existence.
<i>((Join the club with those who.... let's just
say I am not and never have been a metal fan, except
for "joke metal" bands.))</i>
Okay, so maybe I should have had a few more 
albums in the collection before attempting this list, 
but I do what I can.  I guess college really cut back on my album purchasing.  
You'll get the Top 4 of '04 at the end of the year, 
but as it stands, until yesterday, I hadn't bought anything that wasn't 
from a previous year/era.  
My trip to Strawberries and Newbury Comics yesterday rectified that.  
I'm working my way through Rush, <i>Feedback</i>, (Atlantic), 
Velvet Revolver, <i>Contraband</i>, (RCA), and 
Modest Mouse, <i>Good News For People Who Love Bad News</i>, (Epic).  
The Rush album is an 8-track disc of covers of 60's rock 
that influenced them.  
They put it out as a commemorative of their 30th anniversary this year. 
While it's really not too much to write home (or you) about, their cover 
of Cream's cover of Robert Johnson's "Crossroads" 
is well worth the purchase price by itself.  
<i>((OK, but I do prefer Robert Johnson's original and it was MUCH
more fun to listen to it when no one knew who Robert Johnson was.
I have him on vinyl, just to show you how far back that goes....))</i>
Also included on the disc are covers of Blue Cheer's "Summertime 
Blues," the Who's "The Seeker," as well as 
"Heart Full of Soul," "For What It's Worth," "Mr. Soul," 
"Seven and Seven Is," and "Shapes of Things."
<i>((Hmmmm, does sound like a fun disc though, especially for car listening!))</i>  
I started listening to Modest Mouse, and I like it, 
but I'm still working on getting into it.  
Velvet Revolver is the Audioslave-like merging of 
vocalist Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots) with 
Slash, Duff, and Matt Sorum (Guns 'n' Roses) and Dave Kushner.  
<i>((Oh gosh, you're gonna wake up a few of my music fans I've
not heard from in awhile.... go ahead, why not?))</i>
I had decided to pick this album up after hearing some 
preview tracks and before I knew who the lineup was.  
I picked this up because it was the only 
pure hard rock I heard in my search.  
I'm sick and tired of the whiny junk that passes as 
new rock (i.e. Linkin Park, pretty much everything else consisting of young bands).  
<i>((Oh yeah, I've NEVER been so discouraged by the lack of really interesting
new bands, I keep thinking I'm getting older, but then I go back and listen
to something like original Joy Division, or EVEN, dare I say it, Mott the
Hoople, and realize that the whole rock genre is completely moribund.
Mott was derivative in its time from the Rolling Stones and Beatles, yet
it still had some amazing sparks of inventiveness... then you had the 
punk/new wave genre.... and even house was interesting at first until
it and ska and rap mostly degenerated....))</i>
I haven't heard the whole Velvet Revolver album yet, but in contrast to 
most albums, the best tracks seem to be placed at the end instead of the first 5 songs.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I previewed Los Lonely Boys and The Cure's new albums.  
Los Lonely Boys had a couple of promising tracks, especially "Heaven," 
<i>((Yeah, I've heard that one on the radio, and it's OK, but really...
nothing to write home about.))</i>
and one later in the album that was very Santana-y.  
Most of the album was too sappy for me, though.  
<i>((Seems to make it for radio play at the moment, though.))</i>
The Cure was just too Cure-ish for me.  
<i>((And just WHAT, pray tell, is wrong with that???
You do see that we have some VERY different tastes.
But that's OK, don't stop....))</i>
Oh, and I tried Phish's new release, but it really didn't do much for me either.
<i>((Being up here in the Northeast, it was interesting to follow the
fiasco of the "farewell concert".  Since Cher is currently on her (I believe)
sixth farewell tour, and knowing what kind of band Phish is, I will be shocked
if they don't come out again with more "farewell concerts".
For those that didn't follow it, Phish had a farewell breakup concert up in Northern
Vermont a few weeks ago.
Unfortunately, in our summer of coolness and rain, it rained a whole lot before
the concert, and they didn't really have enough places to park in the first place,
so it became a giant traffic jam and they tried to close it down.
Lots and lots of people parked on the Interstate highway and hoofed it 
ten (?) miles to the concert.
Still, Phish is OK, but nothing to develop Grateful Dead fanaticism about.
Even though I'm not a Dead fan, at least I understand its attraction.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some of my other favorite albums of the 1990's, 
which I won't elaborate on now, but maybe later:  
Johnny Cash, <i>Unchained</i>, 1994 (American); Steve Vai, <i>Fire Garden</i>, 1996 (Sony); 
A3, <i>Exile on Coldharbour Lane</i>, 1997 (Elemental/Geffen); 
Afghan Whigs, <i>1965</i>, 1998 (Columbia); 
Outkast, <i>Aquemini</i>, 1998 (LaFace/Arista); and Reel Big Fish, 
<i>Why Do They Rock So Hard?</i>, 1998 (Mojo).
<i>((To show how and where our tastes differ, I only own the last one
on this list.))</i>
Well, now it's July 5, so I should probably wrap this up and 
get it in the mail.  I had included a few quotes relating 
to Diplomacy (however tenuously), but I have too many to 
spring on you at once, so here are two:
"Will no one tell me what she sings?  
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow for old, unhappy, far-off things, 
and Battles long ago."  Wordsworth:  The Solitary Reaper.
"Honesty is the best policy, and spinach is the best vegetable."  Popeye

Hey, Boob, when you make an ordinary assertion in print, it would be 
nice to be right every time but an error might be allowed to slide every 
now and then.  However, when you make a point of making a correction, 
you need to be correct... or I get to rip you a new anal pore, just for 
emphasis on accuracy.  You were one out of two this issue.  Yeah, 
"mayonnaise" has two N's and one S, not the reverse.  But "whisky" with 
no E is not merely a misspelling introduced in the "wild west", "the 
only place they use that spelling."  You got a lobby-prestige paper at 
work?  Or a magazine that carries liquor ads at home?  Open up the NY 
Times or Wall Street Journal and find an ad for The Balvenie; there's 
one every day with a cartoon man with a bowtie.  Look at the bottle 
photo, read the label, look at the bottom.  "MALT SCOTCH WHISKY."  Look 
at other fermented products from Scotland.  The old-school stuff, the 
single-malt original article, uses no E.  The spelling you think of as 
the only valid Standard English is actually the decayed version.  It 
belongs on lowest-common-denominator USA bottles, most of which are as 
inferior as "American cheese" or our major brands of beer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fifty percent good won't get the Red Sox in the playoffs and it doesn't 
get you credit for your overwrought overemphasized attempt to call me 
wrong.  You will grovel in abasement, sir, which I will consider merely 
appropriate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Don't forget the extra writhing for calling my spelling "egregious 
grammatical errors."

<i>((First of all, let me say that I was wrong not once, not twice, 
but THREE separate times on this issue!!!
This sets new standards of three strikes and you're out.
I'm down for the count, under water long enough to be drowned rat.
First, of course, whisky is NOT a misspelling, it is completely 
legitimate.
SECOND, it wasn't introduced in the wild west BUT in Scotland
and thus of course it is NOT the only place that uses this spelling.
THIRD, and finally, for THIS egregious error, the whiskey with
an `e' is the decayed version.
I'm just completely wrong.
In an effort to redeem myself, I went to the Oxford English Dictionary,
which offered me no hope, but at least the opportunity to be correct.
They, of course, have no interest whatsoever in the wild west, if they
even know where it is relative to Wales.
But they do note that in modern trade usage, Scotch Whisky and Irish 
Whiskey are thus distinguished in spelling so that the Whisky spelling
applies to Scotland, while the Whiskey spelling applies to Ireland.
I got some more business from Mike, so let's go there next.

Do you read Groklaw?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No, not until you sent me the link below....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mark, Jim, this is the most interesting and maybe most useful
single-issue website I've seen.  www dot groklaw dot net .  I've been
reading bits on it for months.  Consistently up-to-date, fact-based,
providing original sources.  Topic is the SCO copyright attack on Linux
and the resulting lawsuits.  Groklaw's creator described the site thus
in a 14-August posting:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Groklaw's Purpose

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Groklaw is not a discussion board, although it's enjoyable and sometimes
useful to have discussions along the way, or a blog or entertainment,
though I try to make it funny and a pleasant experience. It's as
complete a record as I can make it of this historic case, with all
significant details recorded for history. That is why we have SCO
Archives, a chronological listing of what happened by date. We have the
IBM Timeline and one for Novell and Red Hat too, with all the legal
documents and the dates they were filed, and we have the Legal Docs page
also, which is currently in process of being updated and rearranged. All
the legal documents filed are available as PDFs and as text, for the
visually-impaired, who can have difficulty with PDFs, I've been told,
and so that they can be searched by keywords using our Search utility.
All that work is done by volunteers, some of whom go to the court to
pick up documents and exhibits, some scan, some transfer from PDF to
plain text, some do the HTML, some research, some send me links to
stories worth covering, some attend court hearings and give us reports.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Groklaw is also an anti-FUD site. And I hope it's a place to grok enough
of the law, so if anyone has any information that could be useful, they
know where to bring it. That is the purpose of the Legal Links page, to
show you where you can find legal information, and that is where you
will find links to all the relevant courts too. We also have the Quote
Database, so you can find specific quotations by the principals in the
SCO story, which is updated by volunteers. Also, we offer transcripts of
the hearings, teleconferences, of media interviews and public
appearances, when we are able to obtain necessary permission.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Groklaw isn't Slashdot and it isn't the New York Times or the Drudge
Report. It's a working site, thousands of people - more than 7,000 now
- working together as volunteers, applying open source principles to
chronicling the SCO legal assault on the FOSS community and trying to
help to defeat what we believe is a wrongful attack. Groklaw is a
non-commercial site. I am a volunteer too. I can tell you I've never
worked so hard in my life, because I work for a living and do this in my
free time afterward. Mathfox is a volunteer too. We are all volunteers.
It's our way of saying thank you for software that the community wrote
and gave as a gift to the world.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My concept was this: Many of Groklaw's readers know the history of UNIX
and the SCO/Caldera history too, because they were there. They lived it.
So my idea was that if I explained what would help, they would know
where to find historical evidence that could make a difference. And it
has happened just that way. Groklaw is not like any other site. It's sui
generis, unique in its goals and purposes. So far as I know, it's never
been done before, which is the creative fun of it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am explaining all this, and showing all that we do and offer, because
we have hundreds of new members since SCOForum and a lot of new
visitors, too, and many of you may not know all that is available here.
Enjoy our hard work. And feel free to participate. "

Jeezus.  I'm tempted to get back into an avocation I swore off twenty 
years ago, before the general public had heard of such things, just to 
penalize you for that statement.  Perhaps I could shock you into 
recognizing how you sound like the people who imagined in 2001 that 
terrorists could never strike on US turf.  
<i>((Well, definitely not on that one, as I was on record after the
Cole bombing as saying that Al Qaeda definitely would strike at the
US itself, in a big way.
I didn't directly see airplanes, but I was not surprised and the instant
it happened, sitting in the airport in Chicago downed on the ground stop,
I knew it was Al Qaeda.
I spent that evening stuck in a trucker motel bar explaining who Osama
Bin Laden was to those long distance truckers.))</i>
The temptation isn't enough 
to get me to risk facing Homeland Security forces, though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two weeks ago, you were getting e-mails (and probably port scans) every 
day from Edi's computer (although not labeled as such).  Once he 
noticed, he asked me for help and I had him run Spybot.  It removed 
"over 45 files" of infection.
<i>((Yeah, I thought it was from Peery's computer since my spam checker
shut Peery down, but it probably was masked that it was coming from Edi.
I did notice.))</i>

((You should know better.... you cut off my message... ;-) 
[[above where I lost the beginning of what I originally said]]))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Let me try an analogy, apparently there are still 1 million
households leasing telephone equipment from AT&amp;T, a failed
monopoly in all other respects, and in fact an unwillingness
to get away from these failed models caused their current
plight.  In the future, one could see Microsoft in that same 
situation, with a million hangers on.  As competition for
leasing with purchase came in, there was no need for anyone
to "sabotage" leased phones, or create a religion around
purchased phones.  We can laugh about the stupidity of 
continuing leasers, but all I'm saying (not with judgment,
a fact) is that the nature of the competition between
the "stupid monopoly" and the new technology affects the
development of markets, labor markets, for sabotage.
Economists actually have studied this "in general".))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I'm not going to defend Microsoft, or criticize open
source defenders, I'm just going to say that the current
"war" environment is engendered by the nature of the
ground on which the battle is being fought.  And no one
is completely right.  The Red/Blue battle has the same
characteristics too.  Money and attention is greater
the shriller the field of battle.
To be a bit more specific, the "real" differences
between the Democrats and Republicans probably are
as small as Ralph Nader asserts that they are.  Both
sides have realized (the Republicans first, the Democrats later)
that the best way to raise the most money is to create and
push hot button issues.
The rhetoric around this money raising is SO strong now that 
I think people are serious when they can't see why John McCain
is being honest about the political issues in standing behind
his party.
I just wish he would, at the same time, decry the trivial
radicalization of all the issues.
This is what McCain was trying to stop with the Campaign
Financing Reform that ended up failing dismally.
I think if we're ever going to free our political
campaigns from cheap radicalization and annoying
polarization it has to come from lessening the incentives
to engage in it.
I'm not entirely sure how to do that, but just legislating
against it will never work.
More fundamentally I remain scared and fascinated by the flip
flop of the parties on fiscal responsibility.
Remember in 1960 and 1964 that the Democrats were the ones
running on tax cuts and deficit spending while the Republicans
were against it.
My colleague Larry Kotlikoff here at Boston University has written a book 
"The Coming Intergenerational Storm" that
all financially conversant Americans should be familiar with.
Larry, unfortunately, falls over that radicalization line himself
just a bit, but the kinds of solutions he offers for our current
and coming fiscal crises have the same style as that which should
be applied to campaign finance reform.))

toward the radicalization of OS's, I continue to try to figure
out how to keep my bile levels down, down, down.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, I wrote the earlier message with a grin, not with a snarl.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But read this parody white paper on "total cost of 0wnership" (with a 
zero; that spelling refers to a computer being under an outsider's 
control) :
http://www.immunitysec.com/downloads/tc0.pdf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So here's a question for your role as editor in healthcare economics. 
How much cost is placed on hospitals and clinics as a result of worms 
and viruses?  Extra tech staff time; wasted medical and support staff 
time; even patient lives lost due to failures of computer-controlled 
systems.  Try this experiment, for which you might need your brother's 
help:  Get a new computer bought off-the-shelf with Windows XP, or if 
you can't, then get a surplus PC or laptop and wipe it clean and 
reinstall XP.  Assume you know about Service Pack 2 and try to download 
it first thing - but without doing anything extra, like adding a 
hardware firewall (such as Linksys' router) or turning on XP's software 
firewall or installing ZoneAlarm.  So you expose your new system to the 
internet via a hospital's intranet, if you're in a healthcare worker's 
environment, or via your journal's intranet if your employer has one. 
See how long it takes for your guinea pig to start sending outgoing 
packets, or freeze up, or hijack your browser and open a bunch of 
pop-ups and pop-unders.  Most worms try to spread to the subnet first 
before trying elsewhere on the Internet; if you had one vector get in 
(perhaps somebody used a VPN connection from an infected laptop, VPN 
gets passed right through the company net's firewall), then any machines 
with the RPC vulnerability unpatched will be sending signals all around 
the intranet, and you'll be 0wn3d in minutes.  Almost certainly before 
you can get the computer fully patched and get defenses set up such as 
configuring XP's firewall, downloading an antivirus program and updating 
its definitions, downloading a malware scanner like Spybot-S&amp;D and 
updating its definitions, configuring your browser's cookie manager and 
various other security settings, and so forth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No question it is huge, so huge that the continual battle is 
having real effects, not just on the health economy, but the economy
as a whole in lost productivity.
Some of my economist colleagues are studying these things, but I 
must admit to not being fully conversant with the results.
I could look around if you really want to know.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You'll find why this in fact *is* a matter of substantial concern 
affecting healthcare economics.  You don't have to care, but I'm 
inclined to argue that you "should" care either professionally or 
personally.  What if "the terrorists' next strike" (some terrorists' 
next strike) is a really hellacious exploit that thoroughly trashes 
every NT/2000/XP Windows desktop PC and laptop and webserver and 
mailserver and laser-microsurgery controller and MRI analyzer?  What if 
evry machine still works but the networking is rendered unusable, which 
would knock computers of all operating systems offline?  That alone 
would shut down credit-card billing and insurance verification - 
nontrivial elements of healthcare economics.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think, fortunately or unfortunately, businesses have
to be very diligent to prevent just the kind of exploitation 
you're talking about.  And personally, I do the malware
protections, am diligent, and then I don't worry much after that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd say that's healthy, as a general approach.  Once you've taken the 
precautions you can, and implemented the safest practices you reasonably 
can, then "worry" won't do any good, and becomes erosive.  A certain 
amount of responsibility actually frees you to enjoy relaxed time 
without fearing negligence.  I was just reacting to your earlier 
phrasing; I knew it was more likely that your actual attitude is more 
like the phrasing above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'm not against the open source movement, but the downside of that
is that it encourages those who are targeting Microsoft because
they are Microsoft.))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't understand that at all.  Do you mean the F/OSS community itself 
promotes that, or its mere existence somehow promotes an us-against-them 
mentality that wouldn't exist if all software were proprietary?  Either 
way, I am quite unpersuaded, after reading such debates (and 
Microsoft-funded FUD) for years.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"White hat" independent researchers and "black hat" crackers find 
vulnerabilities all the time in OSes and middleware and application 
programs.  Some of the problems are unique to IE or a particular Windows 
server version, others are in common implementations of protocols where 
Windows and UNIX and Linux share the vulnerability.  The difference is, 
when a Linux vuln is found, it gets verified and posted, people work on 
it based on its urgency, somebody proposes a solution, the community 
peer-reviews the fix, and it's in the development sourcecode tree within 
days for anyone to use.  When a Windows or IE vuln is found, it gets 
posted to a public buglist, but not acknowledged by MS; then we wait 
months for MS to notice it and develop and test a patch, and eventually 
the fix might show up in Windows Update, and might or might not work 
correctly without introducing a new vuln.  If the fix breaks previous 
patches, you might have to go through multiple download/install/reboot 
cycles to get it working at all.  Meanwhile the exploit has been running 
thousands of zombies for months.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
How does this, or any part of the F/OSS model, encourage crackers (as 
compared to legitimate hackers - Ashcroft doesn't know the difference) 
to target Microsoft products or to go after the company's websites?  If 
all programmers worked to closed standards, would vulnerabilities stop 
being discovered?  Would crackers say "Microsoft is swell, IBM is the 
big evil monopolist so let's all write worms for OS/2"?  Or would they 
all become cooks and barmaids because they saw no dualism without the 
open-source model?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm stumped on the logic here, Jim.

Dear Jim, 
My Texas Rangers just dropped four straight to Baltimore, and they're starting

Surprisingly it isn't the pitching so much (although this rookie Rigilio!?
is a wheels off whip) as a lack of hitting.
Oh well, I asked for above .500 ball, and we're still in the playoff hunt 
which is a miracle.
Next up - a three-game homestand against the hated Yankees.
If we take two out of three I'll be ecstatic.
<i>((Yeah, well, as of THIS writing, they're still hanging in there,
though playing .700 ball the last two weeks falls behind the .900 ball
that the Red Sox and the Angels have been playing.
I think at this point the Red Sox and Angels will make it, A's and 
Rangers won't.
But they'll keep you hanging until the last week of the season!
In the NL, watch out for the Astros gaining on the Giants and Cubs
for that wild card slot.
Of course, I keep rooting for the Giants, but their pitching really
is atrocious.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The big news here is the Bureau of Prisons has decided not to offer the 
Residential Drug and Alcohol Program (RDAP) here at Allenwood Camp
any longer.
This means that inmates such as myself who are waiting for our turn to
enter RDAP will have to be transferred.
Any inmate who has already <i>started</i> the program will be allowed to
stay here and finish it.
I'm supposed to begin RDAP in December or January.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The decision to cut the program here is financial more than anything.
Because this is an old camp, the union contracts are different.
We spend maybe a million dollars a year more to staff Allenwood
than other camps in Pennsylvania with similar inmate population levels.
The desire is to cut the population here down to between 150 and
175 inmates (from the current almost 300) through attrition
(inmates completing their sentences or graduating RDAP) and
transfers.
Then a number of staff positions will be eliminated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'd prefer to stay but I have no choice if I am to participate
in the program.
However, here is where BOP wisdom seems to enter normal government
idiocy.
Rather than leave me here for 4 to 6 weeks and then transfer me to another
RDAP facility, I'm told I will be transferred very soon (possibly this week)
15 miles away to a camp in Lewisburg.
Then, a month or so from now, they'll transfer me AGAIN to an RDAP facility.
I'm working on getting that changed, but success is doubtful.
<i>((Unfortunately, you know really why this is, since you are being
viewed as a chit in a queue.
And they are stacking up the queue for RDAP elsewhere so that they can
quickly bring your facility down closer to the goal quicker.
This saves them money and probably earns some administrator somewhere
a bonus.
It is really hard to design incentive schemes in government organizations
to keep the situation for the clients at the top of the agenda.
I know, since I've spent so much of career doing it.
It isn't as easy as just "write a directive to do it" although
a lot of these Bush political appointees think it is.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll write as soon as I have a new address, although mail is supposed
to follow me for 30 days.
Perhaps you'll be able to e-mail the ICFMM players when you hear the news.
<i>((No news yet, but yes, I will do that.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Not much else to report.
I'm waiting for my next doctor appointment to have a few more lesions
biopsied.
It's supposed to be early September, so I assume this transfer
fiasco will screw that up.
Believe me, I'll make it a priority no matter where I am at the time.
I can't afford not to make waves.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Football preseason starts tonight.
Go Packers, go New York Football Giants... and I hope
Dallas goes winless....
<i>((Living in the Dallas area, being exposed to those Dallas fans,
really does get one's dander up, doesn't.
I was SOOOO turned off by Dallas Cowboys fans in my year in Dallas
that I've never watched a football game again since, and I moved to
Dallas as a Cowboys fan (though I always preferred Craig Morton to
Roger Staubach).
One might say I overreact, but I really discovered that I just didn't
like football that much anyway.
They seem to have some kind of football team near where I live,
but I don't pay attention.))</i>
and finally I hope Philly fails to get to the big game AGAIN!
Teee, heeee!
Stay in touch!

(ENGLAND to RUSSIA): I see St. Petersburg twice!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FLIP FLOP): Ivan Istavich looked at his generals as if they were scared little children in 
the wind, though his generals are afraid. The risk of shooting the messenger 
is always risky within the government and Ivan had no problem purging anyone 
who couldn't atone for their failures.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Czar Istavich, I regret to inform you that our Northern port has been 
overrun." General Neriak said with trembling lips.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Defense Minister, Stalin, what do you think of the loss of Stp to the 
British?" Ivan asked.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"May I speak freely?" Stalin asked biting his tongue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yes, you may." Ivan said staring at Stalin.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I have mixed feelings. On one hand we've lost a port that we may never be 
able to get back no matter what despite our armed forces within the area. We 
have them out numbered and flanked we could potentially retake Stp at whim. 
My other thought is that perhaps upon gaining Stp the British will halt 
their attack." Stalin said.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Noted," Ivan said, "Admiral Istev what is your opinion?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I think we should retake Stp and give the British a good kick in the 
balls." Istev said looking Ivan square in the eye.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I will consider this and have our Foreign Minister check on what can be 
arranged so that I can make a better decision. Either way." Ivan said 
turning off the light.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BANG! A gun shot rang loudly inside the small command conference room.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

1) 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>End Game Statements:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Turkey recap (Sean O'Donnell, Standby Turkey): Well, obviously 
the civil war that had erupted in Turkey led to 
my rising to power, unfortunately for the Turkish ppl I was a really long 
emplaced English spy. My parents had long since had been emplaced in Turkey 
till I was born, and they had taught me everything that I knew though that 
is neither there nor here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once I had taken power the only option I saw for Turkey's survival was 
to keep the Italian Turkish alliance that had struck me to be the alliance 
that my predecessor had. I then had thought of my treason as a way out of 
English rule, but Prime Minister Jody had been overthrown from his 
leadership and Mike had taken his place had put a real dampener with my 
original plans of giving Italy the win while I merely survived and with the 
overthrow of Italy it had derailed my plans as well since I had felt that 
I'll bring Jody to a win by being the ever loyal ally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I then sought to bring Don into the game by giving him War and by 
showing my resolve I attacked Mike on a whim based on false information that 
I had later found out that they weren't so false. I couldn't allow someone 
who had planned on attacking my newly gotten power a win and since at the 
time I had thought it was false and it wouldn't happen and I had made a 
brutal mistake. I found out it was indeed the strategy being used. (Sorry 
Mike the information was you'd attack after my naval defenses was thinned 
out which would be in the future, but I couldn't take the chance hence and 
it made sense within how we were coordinating. Too many consistancies while I 
had tried numerous times to get Italy to spearhead the invasion.) Because of 
the information I had decided to continue my acts of Sabotage. Once the 
proposal came out of EFG I saw my chance to give the game to my parents' 
homeland and thus took it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yeah I know probably not as good as the Star Trek press, but I decided 
to be creative with this if that's cool??
<i>((Sure, Sean, thanks for stepping in and being such a good standby.
You have to play your game once you're in.
And you did.
Thanks!))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
Fall 1916 was two game years by that measure.
If Turkey is missing TWO of its home centers in Winter 1917,
I think we are still going to advance to the next level of
voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be
allowed with failure to vote equalling a yes.
If any other significant movement or centers change hands
then that will be another story, of course.
This does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
He did, of course, finish second, congratulations to Paul who won through
persistence.
I think we'll probably retire this game for a bit, unless their is a swell
tide to run another one.
It is EASY to play!!!
All you have to do is write orders.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
(As we can see, Tom and David are neck and neck for the lead in this, but
Rick is sweeping up all the points.)
I'm not setting up a separate scoring method.
BUT..... we can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick already is way ahead of this pace and picked up the most
replenishment again, plus more points).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Note that Bruce Edwards has a new E-Mail address...... you can all 
guess what that means!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JOKER to BOOB):  Yeehaa, second in point count!  Now we're cookin'.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DAVE to JIM):  What I find most impressive is that Tom still has the highest
replacement count, and he got a 12, the lowest possible, last turn!  Guess
everyone's allowed to nod off now and then.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DAVE): Yeah, he may be noddin' a bit this time too, wish him luck,
I think he's having computer problems!!!
