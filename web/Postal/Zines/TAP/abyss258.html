All of our subszines (<i>Tinamou, Deny Everything,</i> and <i>Houdini Blues</i>)
are now accessible via the above web page.
I think <i>Houdini Blues</i> is the only one in this issue.
Don is a bit late getting <i>Deny Everything</i> out, though he sent
around adjudications.
And I'm not sure what David is doing at the moment with <i>Tinamou</i>.
Speaking to SELF and others, if you haven't sent orders to David yet,
do so NOW!!!

<br /><br />``We have the euro here. 
It was supposed to be worth more than the dollar, but something went wrong.''
Quote by European Oscar Dijkhoff recently on rec.games.diplomacy.

<p>
rec.games.diplomacy is going to celebrate its 10th Anniversary this year,
the Usenet vote putting it as a legitimate newsgroup happened in October
1992, with the official start in November.
Thanks to Nick Fitzpatrick for running that vote, check it out sometime.
I spend a fair bit of time posting there and have since the beginning.

<p>
<br /><br />Sorry we're late again.  A whole slew of varying issues all came together
with the stars to make this issue late.
I'll begin with the less happy ones, and then finish off with the semi-bizarre.
First off, I'm dedicating this issue to Bob Acheson and his long history in
the Diplomacy hobby.
As those of you who have been following issues in the Colonia game know, Bob
has been battling cancer and been in and out of the hospital.
I hope his prognosis is improving, but with his current treatment, he is
resigning all games, including the two here.
BUT, I want to emphasize that his szine <i>The Canadian Diplomat</i> is still
coming out on schedule, the latest issue avoiding my delay.
So, ***I*** really have no excuse, but I did have the more difficult task
of getting the standby for Colonia.
Harold Reynolds volunteered quite some time back, but he really hasn't been
following the game.
I am overjoyed to report that Harold is going to step in and play as China.
For the other standby position, we're going to continue Vince Lutterbie's
slow inching back into the Dip hobby and appoint him to the position in
Fantastic Voyage.
This also allows me to give publicity to Vince's mystery novel <i>After
the Facts</i>, whose web page you can visit at www.after-the-facts.com.
It's not quite published yet, but it will be very, very soon. 
I hope that stabilizes that game finally.
Apologies to the players there for Bob's short stay.
Thanks again to Bob for keeping in touch and resigning at the point where
he really needed to!!!
Best of luck fighting this!!!

<p>
OK, next relatively depressing story in my life, is that I had to put one
of my cats, Alex, to sleep on May 7th.  He was 16 years old, so he had a
long life with Charlotte and me, but he's had a tough last six months.
The last straw was that first week in May when his heart started to fail
and he had trouble breathing.  
Apart from being generally traumatic, he was the cat who slept on the bed
with us and I had trouble sleeping (both before and after) for about a week.
He also was the cat who would sit on my lap and sleep while I worked on the
szine, so I'll miss that a lot.
For those who've followed my cats' illnesses, this is not the other
cat, Muffin, who is still going strong (at 16 as well) in her fifth year 
on injected insulin twice a day for diabetes.
So this is still a cat szine, through and through.
But don't ask me to have Muffin sleep on my lap, she weighs about 16
pounds, now on a new diabetes diet to bring her down to 13-14,
and I think my knees couldn't take it!
Harold Reynolds is famous on the Internet for running the pet humour pages
at www.badpets.net, including http://www.badpets.net/CatHumor/CatLinks.html
which I can still laugh at, so I must be all right about Alex now.

<p>
Next delay, moving toward much more positive things, arose because I spent
two weekends refining the final 2002 Hobby Awards Ballot.
The ballot this year, I think, is the best (and toughest to choose winners on)
that we've ever had.
For the postal people, find the ballot in this issue.
For E-Mail/Web people, check it out at 
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/BALLOT02.html
and vote by September 1st!!!
To those who say the hobby is dying, I find it just getting more and more
exciting.
If it's dying for you, sorry, but it's your fault.  
You just need to find someplace where you can participate at your desired
level and speed of involvement.
The Hobby Awards Ballot is full of people worth saluting.
Just getting nominated was a great honor this year with LOTS of worthy 
achievements.
The total size of the active hobby right now worldwide is probably damned
close to 10,000 people - far more than I can personally keep track of
and just working through the various clusters looking for nominees was
quite a task.
Check out the web links on the ballot and vote!!!

<p>
Next there was work... as most of you know I have two jobs, both nominally
full time.
To make one of them work better, I just got a new full time assistant,
but... you guessed it, she has to be trained and helped to get started
and that takes MORE time!!!
This is really going to make me more efficient and she's great, but
these first couple of weeks were really busy.
Then, working toward the ``weird'', within my university job I spend some of
my time applying for government grants (while in my US government job I
give out grant/contract money to people in universities).
Anyway, that gives me perspective so I really do understand 
``both sides of that game'' but this past week
the weirdest thing happened to me, that delayed the szine this last week.
And this was even beyond my comprehension. 
I realize this will be totally out of context for most of you, but I think
you'll be able to identify with some aspect of it enough if I
explain it.
One of the key things in applying for grants is to find out about the 
requests for proposals soon enough to have the time to prepare a good
application.
On some level, this never seems to work as there always is a ``big rush''
just before the deadline, but that's the theory.
So sometimes you pass up applying for a grant if you find out about it
too late to do a credible job with the proposal.
Well, the last week in April I noticed this opportunity that had a due
date of May 20.
While it was intriguing, I worried that three weeks wasn't enough time
to put it together and the money cap on the grant while seemingly large,
also seemed rather low for what needed to be done.
Well, I called the grant project officer in charge of the grant and 
talked to him about it for about an hour and convinced myself by the
end of the discussion that yes, three weeks wasn't enough time to put
it together and yes, that amount of money wasn't enough to get it done.
So I told him thanks but no thanks.
Well, two weeks later, I get nudged not only by him again, but by 
an outside foundation (also involved in one of those convoluted ways
that isn't worth bothering to explain) that, no, I really DID want to
apply.
Oh, I did, did I?
The outside foundation gave a strong hint that they might be willing
to throw in more money to the winning bidder (money coming from the
federal government for the main grant itself, they are a major private
foundation), so really it could mean more than the original amount
the grant was offering.
Also, they were worried that no one who could pull the project off
was applying.
To make the long story short, I am spending THIS week, doing the grant
proposal that I thought couldn't be done in three weeks in just one.
Does this mean that we REALLY have a 100%, 90%, 50%, 10% or a near 0%
chance of getting this?
Who knows??
I'm a bit mystified and really curious to see what ultimately happens.
I think I'm about done for now, but then in the other job, the one for
the federal government, we have a proposal up to move tens of millions
of budget dollars around the country differently (actually the whole
budget, but that's how much is moving).
As you might imagine numerous Senators/Congressmen/other interested parties
are interested in this... busy, busy, busy.
It's always interesting as a theoretically trained economist to run
headlong into political realities and the perverse issues involved
in their own sense of economics.
It is also a heck of a lot of fun too, and I bear up against multiple
knife wounds well - something this little game of Diplomacy teaches you.
But in any case, all this held up the szine by another week.
Enough of that, let's get into it.

<p>
<br /><br />
<p>
<br /><br />The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!
When the Postal rate increase goes into effect, I'm probably
going to raise that to two bucks, so get renewals in now!

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently ``in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hearby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a ``whenever''.
In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 
I think we really DO have Rip Gooch as the representative volunteer, more forthcoming
on that.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR TOM HURST</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
Wake up, you pile of useless deadwood!!!
STILL nothing on Tom yet.
Let's go, someone find him!!!
You only have two more issues to do it for fifty bucks!!!

<p>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Bill, Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Bill Quinn or Mark Berch or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer

<p>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<p>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university

<p>
Worldmasters 2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals Begin!!

<p>
This is possibly the most prestigious and hard fought E-Mail
tournament around (only challenged by Doug Massey's Vermont
Group Tournaments or the Australian E-Mail Tournament), now
with FOUR full rounds.
The final players (with brief thumbnail capsules) are:

<p>
AUSTRIA: Jack Brawner - most famous around here for being the 
childhood buddy of Dickie-poo Martin, Jack also had a VERY 
successful but short postal career in the 1980s.
Find him at TrojanOwl of aol.com and though he is playing Austria
he will be very, very, very dangerous.

<p>
ENGLAND: Mike Weinzimer - a dark horse cat23 player who has stormed
through the tournament.
Find Mike at mweinzimer of yahoo.com, I don't know much about him other
than that.

<p>
FRANCE: Erlend ``Joe'' Janbu - the first of two Norwegians in the final,
Joe is one of my favorite Dippers.
He can be cautious to a fault, but is nearly devoid of ego which sometimes
works better than anything else.
I'm betting on a Norwegian to win, partly because the Norwegians are in
France and Turkey, but also because they're great players.
I was very glad to finally meet Joe in Paris last year.

<p>
GERMANY: Douglas Vaughan - ditto with Mike, another dark horse cat23 player.
Find Douglas at vaughan4 of mindspring.com.

<p>
ITALY: Egbert ``Egg'' Ferreira - the only returnee from the last WorldMasters
final, Egg is quite a trip.
You can find Egg at egbert of salavip.com.br and I've never known anyone so
excitable but at the same time so controlled at the Diplomacy table.
I don't see Egg has a good player of Italy, but he always surprises me.

<p>
RUSSIA: Darren Koch - one of about a dozen or so members of the 
``Clan Blitzkrieg'', a shadowy E-Mail Diplomacy group that does...
well, I've never been able to figure out just what they do do, 
except they might be seen as fervent crossgamers or might not.
Darren is an Australian teacher 
(as it seems many of the best
Australian players are) and you can E-Mail him, his wife, and three girls
at koch_family of bigpond.com.
He is a BIG threat to win this game.
He's not playing Germany which is his best country.

<p>
TURKEY: Frank Johansen - the ``other'' Norwegian.
Frank heads up the Norwegian Diplomacy Association and I met him at
World DipCon and played with him in Baltimore a few years ago.
I really like the way that Frank plays and I am on record that
I hope he or Joe wins, go Norwegians!!!
I'm still studying my Norwegian tapes so that I can speak with them
in their language next time we get together.
Find Frank at frank.johansen of diplomacy.no.

<p>
The wondrous Peter Richardson pjrich of ntlworld.com is the GM.
If you want to follow the game, send an E-Mail to 
mailserver of cat23.com with the following message:

<p>
 subscribe wm00-results

<p>
 It's off to a wonderful start so far, everyone is just feeling
each other out, no one taking too many risks, but everyone obviously 
totally engaged in the game.
The history of the WorldMasters tournament is that it is not necessarily
THE best player who wins, but the format and style seem to reward effort.
The player who works the hardest likely will win.  
That's one thing you can say about Egg, he always works HARD on the game.

<p>
My dear Jim-Bob -

<p>
Time for me to contribute something useful to The Hobby's greatest zine. 
So what if I can't contribute a solo as Austria - I'll go with the NHL 
playoffs instead.
<i>((I'll note before you start, that I predicted a matchup between
Boston and the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup Finals, with another
win by Colorado fueled by the push from getting Forsberg back.
My earlier prediction that Boston would win the Stanley Cup was
predicated on the Bruins luring Ray Bourque out of retirement to 
fill their void on defense.
The Bruins did actually seriously try to do this, but Ray chose to 
stay retired.
This ruined my ``four teams, four championships" idea for Boston in 2002
predicted before the Super Bowl to a few close friends.
I still am on the Celtics and Red Sox bandwagons.  
They are headed straight toward World Championships.
And the Avalanche are in severe trouble, of course too.
Right now I hope on some level for the DEATH to the NHL matchup of
San Jose vs. Carolina in the Stanley Cup Finals.
Talk about boring outside of those two small towns!!))</i>

<p>
As I begin to type this, it's Monday, April 15, and we're in the lull 
between the end of the regular season and the beginning of the playoffs 
for the greatest trophy in sports.  Some of the biggest news is who 
DIDN'T make it to the playoffs - the Washington Caps, despite one of 
the most talented teams in the East, get early tee times, as do the 
fabulously overpaid New York Rangers.  Eric Lindros and Jaromir Jagr get 
to check out the playoffs on television?!?  And in the west, where the 
hell are the Dallas Stars?

<p>
(Ahem.)  Okay, I'm getting paid to talk about who's IN the playoffs, not 
who's looking forward to October.  Let's start in the East.

<p>
Right off the bat, you've got a fascinating matchup in Boston-Montreal.  
The B's came from nowhere to nail down the #1 seed in the East, and 
their reward is to get one of the hottest teams in the conference (at 
least they were, until back-to-back losses the last weekend of the 
season) in the Habs.  Jose Theodore is playing lights-out in goal, and 
has basically carried the team into the playoffs.  The Bruins have a 
very productive #1 line, and Joe Thornton is destined to become a Peter 
Forsberg-type player as he matures.  But can he carry the team past the 
first round matchup with the suddenly healthy Canadiens? 
<i>((Answer: NO!!!  You called this right and I called it wrong.))</i>

<p>
I would dearly love to pick the Canadiens here, as they're my favorite 
team, and a particularly intriguing underdog.  But I have to vote with 
my head over my heart here and say Bruins in five.  Montreal doesn't 
play that well away from the Molson Centre, and their defense probably 
isn't enough to contain Boston.
<i>((Ooooh, no, you wimped out....))</i>

<p>
Philadelphia plays Ottawa in a matchup of underachievers.  The Flyers 
had the best talent in the East, but couldn't catch the Bruins for 
home-ice advantage.  And it doesn't help that they basically limped into 
the playoffs, winning only two of their last ten games.  Ottawa had more 
talent than a seventh-place showing would indicate, and is a very 
dangerous team; if their goaltenders (Patrick Lalime and Jani Hurme) get 
in a groove, Philadelphia could see a quick exit.  I'll go out on a limb 
and pick the Senators in six games.

<p>
I'm guessing that more pundits will pick New Jersey over Carolina than 
any other ``upset" in the first round.  The 'Canes got the #3 seed and 
home-ice advantage over the Devils by virtue of having won the weak 
Southeast Division.  New Jersey finished with four more points than 
Carolina, but has to hit the road for the first two games.  Nobody wants 
to play the Devils at this stage of the season.  They're hot, having won 
eight of their last ten, and there isn't a better money-game goalie in 
the East than Martin Brodeur.  Look for Petr Sykora to turn it up a 
notch and lead the Devils to a five-game win over the 'Canes.
<i>((I'm so happy that the Hartford Whalers came through and won....
what, they've left Hartford???  Say it ain't so!!!))</i>

<p>
The Leafs-Islanders series will probably be the best first round 
matchup, but I think the Leafs have too much talent and are too deep for 
the Islanders.  New York started off the season with an amazing run that 
carried them into the playoffs almost by inertia, thought they did add a 
good ``kick" at the end, going 7-2-1 in their last ten games.  Chris 
Osgood is probably the key to this series.  If he gets on a roll, he 
might toss a shutout or two at Toronto, and that could turn the series 
on its head.  But I think the Leafs, who really are the better team, win 
in seven games.
<i>((Nailed dead on!!!
I love Peter Laviolette and he is going to become the NHL's next super coach.
But not yet, and not with THOSE injuries in the series.))</i>

<p>
The second round in the East would be Boston-Ottawa and New 
Jersey-Toronto.  The former semifinal series would be novel, as the B's 
haven't gone deep into the playoffs for quite a while, and Ottawa just 
hasn't made a statement in years.  I would give the edge to the Senators 
in that series, if only because I'm not convinced Byron Dafoe can be a 
big-game goalie.  Well, I guess there's one other reason:  Boston has 
NINE OVERTIME LOSSES.  This tells me that when the chips are down, the 
B's don't have the stuff.  In the other one, I would be rooting hard for 
the Leafs, but suspect it'll be New Jersey in six games, max, as the 
Devils turn on the heat as the playoffs progress.  That leaves me with 
Ottawa and New Jersey in the conference championship series.  (Now, THIS 
is really going out on a limb, picking the #6 and #7 seeds to make it to 
the finals.)  Ottawa has a stronger attack, and New Jersey has a 
lights-out defense - when they decide to focus.  The smart money would 
be on the Devils, but I'll take the Sens in six to move on to the Cup 
finals.
<i>((Not precisely correct, but Ottawa could still make it as I write this.))</i>

<p>
It's now Tuesday, and time to go on to the West, where most of the real 
power teams are.  The 1 vs. 8 matchup is not as easy as it should be for 
the President's Cup winners from Detroit.  Vancouver is 
sssssssssssmokin' as the playoffs arrive, having gone 8-1-1 to close the 
regular season.  The Wings are going in the opposite direction, having 
won only once in their last ten.  The Wings are very talented, but also 
far older than the Canucks, and most of the Wings played an Olympic 
schedule in addition to the regular NHL season.  I say they're tired.  I 
say they might not be able to suddenly turn things around just because 
the playoffs get underway.  I say they're very vulnerable to an upset.  
But in the end, I say they still win, in five games; only a dominating 
performance by Todd Bertuzzi, or Trevor Linden's taking over a couple of 
games, can give Vancouver a real shot at it.

<p>
Colorado probably did not want to face Los Angeles in the first round 
this year, but that's the luck of the draw.  The Kings are vastly 
improved, perhaps the best version this franchise has seen since the '93 
Stanley Cup finalists.  The Avs have better goaltending in the 
inimitable Patrick Roy, who almost always rises to the occasion in the 
springtime.  They may also get Peter Forsberg back, which would be a 
real psychological boost; it remains to be seen whether he's sharp after 
a layoff that has stretched beyond a year now.
<i>((I think we all have been impressed by Forsberg.
If anything he is fresher and MORE sharp than he would have been after
a long season at his age.
This just makes me more curious about what would have happened to the
Bruins if they had lured Ray Bourque back.))</i>

<p>
But the Avs are also vulnerable, in that their defense is nowhere near 
as strong as it was last year when they hoisted the Cup.  Of all the 
first-round series, this is the hardest one for me to call; Colorado is 
better on paper, but LA has better than just a puncher's chance of 
making it through to the conference semis.  I'll again go with my brain 
over my heart and pick Colorado, but I think it'll take 'em seven games 
to do it.

<p>
The Phoenix Coyotes put on an impressive stretch run to sew up the #6 
seed, and as a reward they get to face the Sharks.  Oy vey.  San Jose 
has two capable goaltenders in Evgeni Nabokov and Miika Kiprusoff 
(though Nabokov will probably see most of the ice time in these series), 
and a wonderful #1 line featuring the supremely talented, but as yet 
underachiving, Teemu Selanne.  You can bet that 'Yotes owner Wayne 
Gretzky will be in on the strategy sessions, but I don't think even he 
can figure out a way to win this series.  Sharks in five; I think a 
sweep isn't out of the question.

<p>
Now that I've dissed Phoenix, and probably jinxed San Jose, it's time to 
move on to the 4-5 matchup, St. Louis-Chicago.  The Blues were my 
preseason pick to win the Cup, and while they still might do it, they 
have come nowhere near my expectations for the team.  In contrast, 
Chicago surprised everybody, and put together a year nobody thought they 
had in them.  In the final analysis, one factor leads me to go with St. 
Louis - Chicago is a terrible road team, and the Blues have home ice 
advantage.  I say Blues in seven, with the home team winning every game 
in the series.

<p>
That leaves us with Wings-Blues and Avs-Sharks in the second round.  
<i>((You got THAT right, wow!!))</i>
In the first matchup, I say this is where it ends for Detroit, easily the 
best team in the league over 82 games, but they've gotta be dog-tired by 
now.  St. Louis will have worked every bit as hard to get into the 
second round, but they're younger, and had fewer Olympians than the 
star-studded Wings.  Those Olympians will have played over ninety games 
since the NHL season opened, and I think the Wings' legs will give out 
first.  St. Louis surprises the sporting world in five games.

<p>
The other series will see a surprise, too, to everyone but devout hockey 
fans.  Here goes:  The San Jose Sharks will eliminate the defending 
champion Colorado Avalanche in six games.  San Jose is loaded, far more 
talented than most casual fans know (this is in large part because 
they're a west coast team without major media attention).  And the Avs 
just aren't the team they were over the past three years, Roy's enduring 
brilliance notwithstanding.

<p>
That leaves St. Louis to square off against San Jose in the West finals, 
and here I give the edge to the younger Sharks.  They do have less 
playoff experience, but solid performances from Selanne and Vincent 
Damphousse should propel the franchise to its first-ever Stanley Cup 
finals.  Sharks in seven games.
<i>((As of this writing, you could be right.
San Jose did miss the chance to win the series with the Avs in six
games, though, and Game 7 is approaching.))</i>

<p>
So I have arrived here by some shaky insight and not a little bit of 
ambition for the underdog (a #3 seed against a #7 seed won't exactly 
make most betting lines).  There is also hope for something other than 
the usual assortment of Avalanche and Devils and Stars, oh my, in the 
finals that we've seen for the last few years.  I LIKE the idea of 
getting some fresh blood into the Cup chase.  And a Senators-Sharks 
final would do just that, though it would drive the networks crazy, with 
two smaller-market, unglamorous teams.  Let the oddsmakers pick the Red 
Wings and the Flyers for the Cup - I'll have tons more fun saying, 
``I'll take San Jose to win the Stanley Cup in six games over the Ottawa 
Senators."

``Spider-Man" === a movie

<p>
I've been waiting for this since I was a teenager and my copy of Amazing 
Fantasy 15 was stolen by my little brother and left in a park.  That was the 
final issue of the comic and the only one I ever bought.  It was usually 
filled with sci-fi stories with little actual story and twist endings that 
barely bent.  Steve Dikto was a comic artist then and he'd had a story idea 
that he couldn't sell.  Stan Lee, the comic's editor let him put it in 
Amazing Fantasy 15 seeing as it was the last issue of the magazine.

<p>
Amazing Fantasy 15 sold off the racks.  Spider-Man, was a brand new superhero 
with a teenage secret identity.  Not a rich millionaire teen, no, Peter 
Parker was the nerd kid who bought comic books.  For the first time the 
secret identity of the super hero was someone that the comic buying public 
could identify with. 

<p>
They made it into a movie.  They glossed over a few of the details, but for 
the most part this was the original Steve Dikto story.  Tobey Maguire was the 
perfect choice to play ``Peter Parker."  He was able to project nerdiness and 
nice guy and still managed to convince me that he was ``Spider-Man."

<p>
Kirsten Dunst was maybe a bit on the sweet side for ``Mary Jane Watson" the 
love of Peter's life (in the movie at least, she came along lots later in the 
comic book soap opera).  The ``MJ" character I remember was a lot more fun 
loving and risk taking.  But then I am more nerd than ``Peter."

<p>
The really wonderful surprise was Willem Dafoe as ``The Green Goblin."  The 
weakness of the ``Batman" movies was the supervillains.  They ranged from 
adequate to really sucks.  Dafoe's ``Green Goblin/Norman Osborn" split 
personality was superb.

<p>
Yes, I liked it.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.

<p>
Speaking of sequels, ``Spy Kids 2" is coming.

``The Scorpion King" === a movie

<p>
This was a fun movie.  I'm not sure if the story makes sense or not, because 
to tell the truth I was having too much fun watching the action to pay 
attention to the story.

<p>
The movie has really great action, a powerful villain, an even more powerful 
hero, a small touch of magic, and the aforementioned great action.  One 
important point, the movie doesn't take itself seriously.  

<p>
The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson (his name may have contributed to his growing up 
to be such a kick ass hero) plays the good guy Scorpion King this time, 
rather than the evil monster Scorpion King of ``The Mummy Returns."  It 
doesn't matter.  He has a natural screen presence.  If he ever decides to 
give up his day job with the WWF I predict he will do very well as an action 
hero in Hollywood.

Steve has it precisely right.
They had all the silly western/fantasy movie cliches, all done just right.
You could have imagined that some of the ``peoples'' being terrorized
by the bad guys were western settlers just as easily as the fantasy
peoples they were.
The use of the desert scenery was imaginative and amusing.
And of course the action just pumped and ground onward, never stopping to let
us catch our breath.
Wonderful.))</i>

``Murder 8y Num8ers" === a movie

<p>
I'm not sure what the significance of using `8' in place of `B' signifies.  
Maybe is was marketing.  It has nothing to do with the movie.
<i>((Ditto, this ended up not being at all what I was expecting, since
I figured we would have a serial killer that Sandra Bullock was chasing,
who would do.... yes, eight murders.
But not at all what we found.
Bullock shows a bit of range in this part and I always like her movies anyway,
even the less than effective ones.))</i>

<p>
Interesting characters.  Sandra Bullock plays San Bernardino Homicide 
Detective ``Cassie Mayweather" a tough, smart, demon troubled cop who over 
compensates for being a victim.  Ben Chaplin plays ``Sam Kennedy" first time 
homicide detective.  This is his first case.  Cassie is his partner and 
training supervisor.  Sam is very smart and has come up through the ranks 
very quickly.  Ryan Gosling has a dream role in ``Richard Haywood" the teenage 
golden boy narcissist psychopath who puts Cassie's teeth on edge from the 
first moment she meets him.  Michael Pitt has a second dream role as 
Richard's foil, ``Justin Pendleton" the loner genius, friendless, bitter, and 
arrogant.

<p>
The boys decide that the only way they have to demonstrate to themselves that 
they are free is by killing a randomly chosen victim.  In addition to the 
murder they must control the evidence to provide the police with a killer.  
In order to be completely free they must not only kill, they have to escape 
without any hint that they were even involved.

<p>
Unfortunately for the plan, ``Cassie" doesn't like ``Richard."  He reminds her 
of another golden boy from her past.  The one who murdered her.  Well, it 
wasn't a successful murder but just barely.

<p>
Nice premise.  The characters are very interesting.  The story unfolds with 
relentless logic.  Some twists and turns but no real surprises.

<p>
Not a great movie, but worth watching.

the murders committed by teenagers Parker and Tulloch of two Dartmouth

``Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones'' === a movie

<p>
I have a couple of nits to pick, which I will get to later.  But first,
briefly, ``WOW!!!!".

<p>
<i>((Interestingly, I have almost entirely an opposite view of the movie.
I'll take that divergent view paragraph by paragraph with apologies to Steve.
People will likely love or hate this movie, see which of us you agree with more.))</i>

<p>
Lucas must have read the reviews of ``The Phantom Menace".  None of the things
that were wrong there were in evidence here.  The movie sucked me into the
fantasy from the start.  The action was outstanding, the computer effects
were best yet, and the story didn't suck.

<p>
<i>((I did think the story sucked, mostly.
And the action was mostly merely OK.
I may have prejudiced this by sitting in a big theatre down front,
but I found the computer effects ``fuzzy''.  
I've been told this will look better when it comes out on DVD, since
it was made digitally and then transferred to film.
I say... ``oh really, then why didn't you release it first on DVD??''
I agree that the computer generated Yoda is ``cool'' but awfully cartoony
as he does things that no one with his size and weight should be able to do.
Perhaps he really is extremely dense, weighing about 300 pounds, and only
when he gathers the Force to him aggressively can he move quickly.))</i>

<p>
Hayden Christensen was very good as ``Anakin Skywalker".  His teenage angst
was a bit over the top, but considering that he will turn to the dark side
and become ``Darth Vader", a little emotional immaturity might be in order.
The teenage love affair was very believable.  Although considering that the
object of his affection was Natalie Portman, maybe it didn't call for all
that much acting.  In fact I can't believe that any teenage hetero male could
be in her presence long without starting to trip over his own tongue.

<p>
<i>((Hmmm, I thought this was mostly lame.  I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I actually liked the kid in Episode I better than Christensen.
And I know he can act 'cause he was really good in ``Life As a House''
but mostly sucked here.
Sigh.
Can you tell I didn't like the way they did the lovestory?
Bingo, the most memorable line in the whole movie was a really lame one about
how Padme's skin was soft, not rough like sandpaper.
Uh, duh.
Check out the love scenes and sexual tension in ``Spider Man'', THAT was sexy
and adolescent all at the same time.))</i>

<p>
Natalie Portman was excellent in her role as ``Senator Padme Amadala".  Her
term as Queen was over but she continued on in public service.  I'm not sure
she plays all that powerful a politician, but she handles being an action
hero just fine.  With parents like these it is easy to see that ``Luke" and
``Leia" came by there hero roles honestly.

<p>
<i>((I completely agree with that paragraph.
We also see crystal clearly what the plot of Episode III and the fate of Padme
will be.
I'm not sure if that is a plus.))</i>

<p>
As with ``The Empire Strikes Back" the story doesn't end so much as set us up   
for the next movie.  I can hardly wait.

<p>
<i>((And I worry that it will be worse than this one.))</i>

<p>
Now, the nits.  ``Attack of the Clones" - really?  Well, maybe not really.
In fact, misleading.  But the real nit was in the smuggling of Padme back to
her home after a failed assassination attempt.  The powers that be decided to
send her on a refugee ship.  There was no war going on.  They were on
Coruscant, the capital of the Federation.  What refugees?

<p>
 2.  Nothing changes dramatically in terms of 
revenue sharing or salaries.

 3.  The Yankees will be a contender every year from now on, 
and the Royals won't.

<p>
IF the players DON'T strike in August, then:

<p>
 1.  The owners have a lock out after the WS.  
They cave in by the start of the regular season.

 2.  Nothing changes dramatically in terms of revenue

``So I called up George and he called up Jim, I said let's make a deal.

<p>
He said he'd talk to him.  Gonna start a church where you can save yourself,

<p>
You can make some noise, When you've got no choice...

<p>
You told me useful things, what people think of me, I guess I should thank you.

<p>
It's true, then I agree... I'm all alone, I've got no choice,

<p>
I'm all alone, I've got no choice."

 If you want to submit orders, press, or letters by E-Mail,
you can find me through the Internet system at

If anyone has an interest in having an E-Mail address listed so people
can negotiate with you by computer, just let me know.
FAX orders to (401) 277-9904 if you let me know in advance to be sure
the fax machine is set up. 

<p>
I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small ``s'' instead of a capital ``S''.
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
I have been getting complaints and suggestions for doing underlines.
Underlines are really hard to do and I've become attached to italics
but I am considering this as carefully as I can.
I'm trying an experiment this issue.
Comments are welcome, but I'm not telling you exactly what I did,
let's see if you all can figure it out and comment on it!

<p>
 Standby lists:

<p>
Bruce Linsey, Mike Barno, Dick Martin, Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Glenn
Petroski, Steve Emmert, Mark Kinney, Vince Lutterbie, Eric Brosius,
Paul Rauterberg, 
Heath Gardner, Phil Reynolds, Paul Kenny, Dan Gorham, and John Schultz
stand by for regular Diplomacy.

<p>
Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Phil Reynolds, Jim Sayers, 
and Kurt Ozog
stand by for the Modern Diplomacy game.

<p>
Harold Reynolds was my standby for Colonia and I have to use him this turn.
Help, more are needed for this game, maps are provided for free by me....
I really need another person here!!!

<p>
Let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF.
Standbies get the szine for free and receive my personal thanks.

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Lawyers game is cancelled.
Lawyers suck.... ;-)  
They'll suck US dry, but they refuse to play against each other.
Damn, but isn't that an indication.
I am kidding of course, but unless some lawyers come forward 
wanting to play, we'll cancel this one for now.

<p>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??
Let me or John know!
Jody McCullough is still interested, anyone else?

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<p>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Rick Desper is the only one signed up for that.

<p>
1) Note we'll try this new postal address for Allan Heikkinen.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FOOL to CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY): Well, at the time of writing,
I just got my tax return postmarked and stamped about an hour ago, that
is, around 11:30 pm April 30th ... a good half hour to spare! This has to
have been one of the sillier tax forms. One section at the end reads, in a
literal translation (they send me these things in one of them funny
furriner languages):

<p>
``Ontario Initiative Fund. Fill in this section if you want to make a
donation of part or all your tax refund for 2001 to the Ontario Initiative
Fund, to help reduce the debt of Ontario."

<p>
Or, in a less literal translation: ``Gosh, could you bend over a bit
further?"

<p>
Those wacky taxpersons! Well, no harm in asking I suppose! With that in
mind, I wonder if anyone out there would like to cede me their capital?

<p>
(SILENT TURK to BOOB): How many moles does it take to screw in a light
bulb?

<p>
(BOOB to SILENT TURK): Irrelevant, it's lights out because they can't
get their act together to do anything, let alone screw anything.
Shut them down!!!
(late word, you have!)

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Bob Acheson resigns with these orders and is replaced by Vince Lutterbie.
See his address above.
If you can give me a phone number, Vince, that would be good.
Congratulations on the new book, I hope it sells well!!!

<p>
2) Thanks to Terry Tallman for playing out the Italian position... well,
sort of playing it out.
He did hang out in Portugal for awhile before being eliminated.

<p>
3) The new way of noting orders which fail of execution is more work for me,
so without feedback it will be an experiment only.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(A DRY EYE IS A BLOODY FOCUS PRESS):  Moscovian Murmurs:  Russian spies
located on the west coast of Denmark, a country without a defined coastline,
casually noticed English warships steaming northward in the North Sea.  A
cry of horror rang out of the runny nostrils of the Tzarina, Molitof
Cockwithtail.  She immediately ordered Norway to be protected at all costs,
mostly English loses.

<p>
In the meantime, the Tzarina, outraged by the lazy German army in
Burgundy, decided to attack a German held province, that of Spain.  ``That'll
teach 'em", she muttered, being careful to hold her handkerchief over her
mouth so as not to pollute the motherland of Russia farther and further.

<p>
(THE BERNIE SAGA CONTINUES):  Being swept away by a flood of old smelly beer,
Bernie tried to climb out of that mess.  He grabbed for straws!  He grabbed
for strings!  Hey, he was grabbing for hairs on Shrevey's belly!  Bernie
struggled to make some headway up that fat, hairy, beer-ie belly of Shrevey.
He dug his toenails into the ragged skin, and pulled and pulled with his
arms and hands.  Would you believe that Shrevey decided to both burp and
sneeze?  Yep!  Bernie lost his grip and started sliding downward, gravely
due to gravity.  He past the belt line.  He past the belly button, an outie
[some are innies, and some are outies].  Bernie was sliding further and
further down that fat ole' belly, approaching ... oh, no!  Shrevey is
starting to stand up [a new feat for him].  He is closing his legs together.
Watch out!  Bernie, watch out!  That is Shrevey's crotch you are headed for!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Michael Lowrey tells me that you need only 102 centers or 3/4
approval to get a draw to pass in this, and I believe 50 centers
is required for a win.
Forgive me if this sounds ``weird'' since anyone except Dave
Partridge theoretically could be voted out of a draw.
Clarifications or comments would be welcome.

<p>
2) Bob Acheson resigns, so the game is delayed to allow the entry of
Harold Reynolds as the Chinese player.
Welcome to Harold and thanks for sticking with your long ago commitment
to standby for this game!!!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) For 1902, everyone shifts ``down a country'' so Kenny plays Austria,
Schultz England, Rauterberg France, Muller Germany, Andruschak Italy,
Kendter Russia, and McHugh Turkey.
The moves are due June 22nd, with just press next time.

<p>
2) Isn't this wild? 
Not many bounces for all of those choices!!
Denmark was bounced over and no one tried for Portugal.
All other centers accounted for above.
Lots of spreading, only two ties already.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DISGRUNTLED POSTAL WORKER-MR. JACK MCHUGH): I am making a grab at Saint 
Petersburg as a way of expressing my annoyance at your press to me last 
issue. Consider it a mild spanking. Whilst I have no problems with good jokes 
about my castration and eunuch status, that comment about ``pussy" was over 
the line and needs to be treated accordingly. You have been a naughty boy. 
*s*p*a*n*k*

<p>
(HARRY-BOOB): You will note my orders included the coast the fleet was moving 
to, but is this really needed?

<p>
(BOOB to HARRY): Well, there wasn't a choice that you could move to, 
but St. Petersburg does still have two coasts (it is possible to lose bi-coastal
status or pick it up as a result of the nukes), so you were best off specifying it.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-MS. SANDY): Don't worry about me hon, I love novices, 
just ask anyone. It's the hobby old farts that hate me.
<i>((She knows you well enough to know that she has to watch you like a hawk.
I'd get back in touch if I were you...))</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to WORLD):  Hello-is anybody out there???

<p>
(FLAPJACK-RAUTERBERG): Hey man, I ain't no ``Axis of Evil"...
``Axis of FlapJack" sounds kewl though.

<p>
(GERMANY-ENGLAND): Congratulations. Norway is the only neutral that can be 
grabbed by just one Power. 

<p>
(FLAPJACK-ITALY): Remember, we have nothing to fear but fear itself....
oh yeah, and really big nukes.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-ENGLAND): Norway is all yours but watch out for those sneaky Belgians. 
I hear they speak French and have a real snooty attitude.

<p>
(BOOB to FLAPJACK): I think he managed JUST fine without your assistance.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-KAISER HARRY): Watch out for those pesky Danes. 
They like to watch pornos and eat smelly cheese and 
not the good lesbian pornos either. 
Remember its not how you play the game but how many dots you swipe.

<p>
(BOOB to FLAPJACK): I'm sure you'll remember that as you ponder your lost center.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-SGT. SCHULTZ): I told you to watch out for Serbia. 
They are nothing but trouble. 
They probably gave Turkey the finger so Ms Sandy had to nuke them.

<p>
(SGT SCHULTZ to MCHUGH): So, he speaks to me after 
all these years.  
Well, it hasn't been long enough to have forgotten what a 
clever little snake you are.  I'll have my eye on you amigo.  BTW, I 
was in grade school when Sgt Schultz was a popular character.  What hell 
that was for yours truly.

<p>
(FLAPJACK-JIMBOOB): Is this a great game or what???? 
By the way can we have chemical weapons too????

<p>
(JIM-BOOB to FLAP JACK): You can have whatever you want.
We'll see what it gets you!!

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): All right, who is writing that Black Press under the name 
of Sara Reichert?

<p>
(KARL - HARRY): What do you want to talk about?  I gave you free access to 
almost all of my centers and you complain?

<p>
(BOOB to KARL): Harry wasn't the one who helped himself to them...

<p>
(THE OTHER PAUL): I can't touch a cat without an allergic reaction, 
which might be why I give people the impression that I hate them, but 
they ARE a little fragile for my tastes.

<p>
<i>((I think I see what you mean right now.

Based on that, I think the general public (or at least the techie 
subculture) has a taste for nuke-themed games.  Perhaps that bodes well 
for mass acceptance of Black Hole Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy! 
<i>((I honestly don't understand why it isn't more popular.
It's a really great game, especially in this format.))</i>
However, that may imply that we are in the Final Days, or may at least 
suggest that the Crazy Years will end in matter-energy conversion soon. 
Oh well.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
3) We had some NMR's this time, in which case you played your lowest card
per the rules.
No standbys for this game, you gotta play.
Come on, the game is tight, even if first place looks wrapped up.

<p>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE DESIGNER SPEAKS): OK, on to the Breaking Away rules queries.

<p>
1) I can confirm that it is possible to break away even if you are only one 
square ahead of the pack, and you do replenish with a 1.  I could make up 
some pseudo-psychological justification for this but the truth is that the 
game works better if riders get the opportunity to replenish with a 1 or 2 
occasionally, as it adds flexibility to their choice of movement cards.  
Being able to play a ``2" is very handy sometimes.

<p>
2) If two (or more) riders are in the lead then neither is considered to 
have broken away.  In the face to face game there is an optional rule which 
allows group breakaways whereby 2 or more riders *from the same team* who 
are in the lead but on the same square can be considered as having broken away 
(i.e. they all get the breaking away bonus) but this does not happen very often 
and is very powerful when it does.

<p>
3) Rules queries I can do, just don't bother asking me for advice on tactics!

<p>
(ALICE to WHITE MAID): This two is an improvement over that three I've
been carrying!

<p>
(ALICE to BOOB):  You Boob!  You could have just changed the press to read
`below' and I'd not have complained...

<p>
(BOOB to ALICE): Hey, I love to create controversy and more press...

<p>
(TOM - JIM): Most of my games are in black press, so I've usually run the
press items in order by the power they're purportedly from and to. 
Which limits some of the fun that can be had by judicial placement in the
press stream...  Mayhap, it's not too late to change?

<p>
(JIM-BOB to TOM): It's up to you, but ``ordering'' the press requires
sufficient participation by multiple parties, something we didn't really
get much of this time.

<p>
(W. MAID - BOOB): Gathersburg, MD?  
<i>((That's GaIthersburg...))</i>
That inside the beltway?  Whether or
no, same universe or no, that close to DC, he certainly can't be in the
same world as the rest of us!

<p>
(ALICE to CHRISTIE):  Here ya go, grab a six, then we'll scoot on home.

<p>
(ALICE to PETEY):  Team Work?  What do you think of this job?

<p>
(PETEY GRIPES):
*SQUAWK!*  Looks like I should have chosen Canadian geese - at
least they know how to draft.  *SQUAWK!*

<p>
(ALICE to BOOB):  Drafting?  There's a time to draft, a time to be
drafted, and a time to create a draft.  I've done the former, I've done
the latter, and if the middle hasn't happend (to me) 'tain't my fault!

<p>
(WHITE MAID to BOOB):  Ok!  I got it with Harry and his demand!  So you're
a two handed economist, huh?  Can you imagine a motie economist?  Or, a
quadruchiro-economist?
<i>((Oh absopositivutely!))</i>

<p>
(MORE FROM JOHN): That's all for now.  I might get time to write a bit of music stuff about 
that Louis Jordan 6-CD box set I bought.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.modernhof.webprovider.com/
currently is on hiatus.
I'll try to remember to let you know when it returns.

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with ``wings''.

<p>
3) Thanks to Eric Ozog for playing out the Italian position!
Sorry it didn't work out better for him.

<p>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Drugs and guns and slavery; 
live together in perfect harmony; where the poppy grew;
the soil is dead.''
Sung by the sublime Sally Timms, that's ``Brutal'' from <i>The Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<p>
(BRITAIN - UKRAINE): Hey, Dave, traffic is getting 
a little heavy in the north as well.  Can your economic and political 
structure stand the pressure?

<p>
(BOOB to BRITAIN): I don't know, we'll see... but this next ditty
really captures something!

<p>
(PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES (P) INTERVIEWING GENE RODDENBERRY (GR)):

<p>
(P): What do you think of our new series ``Enterprise''?

<p>
(GR): It sucks, although I do love the Vulcan babe.

<p>
(P): What do you mean ``it sucks''?

<p>
(GR): Would it help if I talked slower?

<p>
(P): Just tell me what's on your mind.

<p>
(GR): First, you are writing this in a way that makes Starfleet look
impotent and even stupid.
<i>((More stupid than the current Bush administration?  Sorry,
cheap shot...))</i>
Second, this is supposed to be a fictional futuristic look at Earth
history.
Next Generation already established that First Contact wiht the Klingons
was supposed to be a disaster.
In Enterprise, First Contact with the Empire had the Captain successfully
saving a Klingon warrior's life.
<i>((Perhaps that one didn't count as the FC that they were talking about,
trying to be helpful...))</i>
The Federation also was not supposed to have any contact with the 
Ferengi until Captain Picard's Enterprise.
Your writers are writing this show like as if Star Trek, Next Generation,
Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and the movies are not part of ``Enterprise'' 's
future.

<p>
(P): Any suggestions?

<p>
(GR): Yes, try hiring writers who have actually seen the other Star Trek's.
Or better yet, hire a few ``Trekkie Advisors''.

<p>
(P): Good idea.
By the way, are you still dead?

<p>
(GR): Yeah!
Me and Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain.

<p>
(P): Sorry I asked!
