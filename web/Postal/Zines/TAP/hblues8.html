<I>Houdini Blues</I> has a game opening in Diplomacy. This is a continuation of 
the game opening I had in <U>CCC</U>, for which Matthew Matz, 
Saul Spiel, Brendan Mooney, Fred Wiedemeyer, Dan Gorham, 
and Frank Easton had signed up. If you're one of these folks, 
please confirm that you're still interested. The game fee is $5 
plus you must, of course, get <I>TAP </I>by one of the usual sources. 
In addition, I would like to start another Outpost game. Please 
let me know if you're interested.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the weeks since September 11, a great deal of 
attention has been placed on aviation in the U.S. The air 
transportation industry certainly faces significant new challenges since 
September 11. Aviation security, something taken a bit too 
casually in this country for many years, is now a headline 
issue. Many airlines are losing money at record rates and laying 
off thousands of employees. That said, the nation faces 
another serious problem  a lack of capacity in the air 
transportation system  that is receiving scant attention. Yet only by to 
acting now, despite the short-term reductions in people 
flying, can we hope to catch up and build a robust aviation 
infrastructure for the future. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Americans boarded airliners in record numbers during 
the late 1990s. With the increase in air traffic came an even 
faster increase in flight delays. The FAA reported that delays 
were up 58 percent between 1995 and 1999, with an additional 
14 percent increase in the first half of 2000. While some 
delays were the result of labor disputes and other passing issues, 
most reflected a worsening capacity shortage within the U.S. air 
transportation system. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While demand for air travel, fuelled by a booming 
economy and low unemployment, increased rapidly, our ability 
to accommodate flights grew at a much slower rate. Fundamentally, the air transportation system labors 
under significant capacity limitations. There is a limited amount 
of airspace through which planes can fly. Likewise, planes 
must take off and land from a limited number of runways. 
While there may be enough capacity on a good day, things fall 
apart quickly during bad weather - which is responsible for over 
70 percent of flight delays. Inclement weather greatly 
reduces, much as pylons on a road can reduce a four-lane road to 
just two lanes and create backups. Weather-related constraints in
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Air Capacity Remains Critical</I>
<TD COLSPAN=1>
<TD COLSPAN=1 HEIGHT=612 WIDTH=246 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the sky can effect a large area - a band of strong storms 
that aircraft need to avoid - or a specific airport as low clouds, 
rain, or strong winds increase the required separation between 
planes and limits the number of runways in use.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aftermath of September 11 and recession have 
forced most airlines to dramatically reduce their flights, which 
has eased pressure on the system. These reductions are likely to 
be only a short-term phenomenon; in time Americans will 
return to flying. The demand for air travel grows as both 
population and per capita income increase. Likewise, the Gulf War 
and associated recession and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 
103 did not prevent airline travel from growing rapidly in the 1990s.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, as the 1990s also proved, there are no 
easy ways to dramatically increasing air capacity. Rearranging 
flight schedules to avoid periods where the number of planned 
takeoffs and landing exceed an airport's theoretical capacity 
can help, though this is not the primary cause of delays. Even 
a heavily debated idea such as &quot;land and hold short&quot;, a 
technique whereby a landing aircraft lands and stops short of 
an intersecting runway, is projected to only increase capacity 
by 15 percent at affected airports. Improved radar, meanwhile, 
can add four takeoffs or landings an hour at airports with 
parallel runways separated by less than 4,500 feet.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While certainly every little bit helps, the 
improvements needed to significantly increase capacity are long-term 
projects, including adding runways and a new flight control 
approach called &quot;Free Flight&quot; that are the most threatened in the 
current environment. At the airport level, adding runways is best 
way to increase capacity. It also is expensive, generates local 
opposition from those that would be subject to increased noise, 
and can take a decade or more to accomplish. In the 1990s, 
U.S. airports added only 17 new runways. Free Flight, 
meanwhile, is a FAA concept for better using the nation's air space. 
Instead of having airliners fly along a limited number of 
predefined corridors under active air traffic control, planes would be 
allowed to fly more directly between cities with less 
direction from control centers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both long-term solutions are very much in danger in 
the post-September 11. Airports across the country have 
already delayed $16 billion in improvements, including runway 
projects in a number of cities including Charlotte and Dallas. As 
for Free Flight, any system with greater active ground control 
negates much of the system's potential
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it is understandable to focus on security and 
economic issues in the wake of September 11, the U.S. air 
transportation system has other fundamental problems that also 
need to be addressed. Unless they are, we risk facing very 
substantial delays in a few short years at airports that have little to 
do with added security precautions.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kevin Wilson (England): This was my first try at Viking 
Dip. I liked it! I like the tight, aggressive variants as a diversion 
from standard Dip now and then. This one and Balkan Wars fill 
that need nicely. Congrats to Pat on a nice win. You called 
it correctly. If I had a chance to win, I needed to turn on my 
ally quicker. But I was concerned that I couldn't beat you to 
the magic number unless I had him with me to hold you back 
and let me get into position. The moves turn before last 
knocked even that hope out. I'm still not sure what Denmark was 
trying to do. (What were you trying to do?) I hope any comments 
from him will shed some light. I thought the suggestions I had 
made would have kept Sweden at bay and you alive so you can 
see why I was surprised at what did come about. Anyway, it was 
fun and I'll have to give this variant a try again 
soon.<U> </U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Michael Lowrey (GM): In over a decade as a publisher and 
GM in the PBM hobby, there are a few things I have never 
understood. At the top of the list is the willingness of many a 
publisher to offer large scale variants while running a small 
circulation zine. It's the typically (male) more is better attitude applied 
to Dip  if a seven player game with 34 centers is cool, 
imagine how cool a nine-player game with 70 centers (say) must be. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also a receipt for disaster. More often than 
not, publishers simply can't fill these opens, even after 
many months of trying. If they do somehow find enough players 
for their favorite (say) nine-player variant, the dearth of 
standbys often undermines the quality of the game. The problem 
is compounded by the length of the game  more players 
typically equals a longer game  and the greater amount of 
time and effort required from both the GM and players to 
complete each turn. By the time the everybody has everything just 
about figured out in the game, it's over. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a better solution. There are any number of 
good five and six-player variants in existence such as Viking Dip 
II. They require less effort to play in or GM than bigger 
variants while still presenting the challenge of a new map. From 
a publishing standpoint, such variant openings can be 
filled. There's also hope of finding enough standbys to keep the 
game going if there are a few drop outs. I encourage all players 
and GMs to give them a try.
