The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date was now a "whenever".
But Peter is now clearly back and appears in most issues!!!
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  
But Rip also has been missing in action lately, I don't have an update but he

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.

<b>THE SEARCH FOR KEVIN TIGHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a very special "search for" coming up in issue #300, and I'm
going to offer a hundred buck reward for that one, so I'm also going to 
up the ante on Kevin through issue #300 to $1 billion dollars.... no,
make that $100, can't quite afford to be THAT generous.
There have been some recent "sightings" of Kevin Tighe.
And he's the reason I first started this feature (for those of you who
don't recall) and he's the one I continue to be most interested in finding.
This may take a bit of real detective work, but as a hint, like many of
us Diplomacy players, I believe he is out there making money on some
of the poker circuits.
I also would like ALL of the previous found people who are still getting
the szine to write me SOMETHING for the 300th issue for this section.
I know I've been having Doug Beyerlein write me lots of little notes
along the way, not all of whom I've been printing, and so I have some
things from him already.
But he may want to send me something else.
What should you write?
Something on what you've been up to, a reminiscence of Diplomacy times
or friends past, whatever, it's up to you, but I want something from
as many of you as possible.
While we're at it, some of you other old timers still getting the
szine (you know who you are, but I'm thinking most particularly of
people like Tom Nash, Dan Stafford, Bruce Geryk, and Steve Hutton,
most of whom were once szine editors) also should write me something!!!
I plan to have issue #300 be the first issue of 2006, so you have the
rest of the year.
I'll save them up for that issue, but get writing now!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

I got called in as a STANDBY for Turkey in game WM04R221!!!
Now I'm negotiating with Lee-Man (G), Buffalo (E), Glenn (F),
Dan (A), Urco (T), and Ian (I).
This is fun, let's see if I can shake the game up a bit.
Right now Ian, Buffalo, and Glenn are leading with Lee-man
looking like the first one out, likely two of those three
will go on to the semis.
More on that as the game develops.
I've been hearing that Dave Partridge's game is pretty interesting too,
but haven't seriously looked in on any of the others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is helping now that I've joined the Yahoogroup WM04-Chat where this
discussion is happening.
You can join too!
But most of the talk there has been about Yann Clouet and the French
Hobby's new "World Palmares Evaluation" of FTF Diplomacy Play.
Of course, Yann Clouet comes out #1, further backing up winning
the John Koning award, and I am 1442nd (in a tie with Mark Nelson
and Tony Dickinson, among others!).  
This uses lots of tournament results, more than 750 of them, and really

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Deadline Winter 2005, Issue #96: December 1, 2005

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have this issue in my hands and I intend to publish it as soon
as I get this issue out.  
I shouldn't be surprised to learn that Tim Haffey has resigned as
lead editor, which casts us back into oblivion, for what?  The
20th time in 96 issues?  Something like that anyway.
What we really need is another good lead editor who wants to
push this for the next year or so to issue 100, or maybe we should
just bring it down now?  
I told people to contact Tim and come forward, and no one really did.
My sense was that <i>DW</i> was being read, just no one was writing
for it.
That is a shame.
But I ***KNOW*** I cannot be lead editor for two szines, I just can't.
So if no one steps forward, the soon to be published 
<i>Diplomacy World</i> 96 will be the last.
But it has been said before, and it has been resurrected, so
we'll see what happens now.

Go Giants (football), Texas Rangers make any moves lately?
<i>((Not that I've heard directly, but they are said to be
seeking pitching and willing to trade some offense as they finished
second in the deal that the Red Sox made for Josh Beckett.
I think they might trade Soriano's relatively poor defense for
a good starter and they're trying to sign Paul Byrd, who I like.
Late word, Soriano goes off to DC and they ALSO finish second with Paul
Byrd, who signed with Cleveland.
I wonder if there is any chance they will trade with the Red Sox for Manny?
I don't see much else earthshattering that the Rangers can do.
Sorry!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, Dave Partridge, and Eric Ozog are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, the other Modern game
is now done!

<b>TAKING OVER ISHKIBIBBLE'S REGULAR DIPLOMACY GAMES</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'M TRYING TO TAKE OVER Phil Reynolds' two regular Diplomacy games somewhere in <i>TAP</i>.
One is going to Harold Reynolds' subszine, since Colonia is over and I'll take the other.
<b>
I am calling for orders from everyone NOW, and whichever game looks easier to start I
will give to Harold, but I'm getting no response.
Should we just shut these down??</b>
I have Phil's last issue, #44, but that was published way back in December of 
2003.
I'm not sure if people have moved or whatever in that time, so a little help would
be appreciated.
And I hope everyone comes back, but I might need some standbys. 
I'm going to start nagging so I can get these restarted.
Please let me know if you care playing, thanks to Karl Schmit for responding
each time that he's in....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England), 
John Power (Germany), Tim Snyder (Italy), and Fred Wiedemeyer (Russia)
are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.
Paul Risner probably is not going to be able to continue in the game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can find that last issue of Phil's szine at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 /Postal/Zines/ishkibibble/ishkibibble_44.pdf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Call for orders is NOW, the next season after the results above.
You should already have submitted these before.
Then I'll give one of the games to Harold.
I'm not getting any traction or writebacks on these games, does everyone just
want to abandon them???

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, but rather than hold up
the game anymore, Eric Ozog has agreed to pay attention to the game and
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
We all hope this will be a brief interlude.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I have a discrepancy on Buddy's cell phone number.  Note above I
have x5771, while below in his press he says it is x5571.  One is 
a typo, the other is correct.  Could Buddy or someone please clarify?
Thanks!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to THE BOARD): I had to put Kathleen in the hospital, and that took
all of my time.  flying high to Morocco caused water to settle in her legs
and feet.  That depressed her and she did not feel like eating.  The body
looks for something to do, and without food in the tummy, will process
toxins.  There goes blood poisoning.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She became excessively weak, pale, and lost 20 pounds in a week.  I had to
pull her, dead weight, wet and cold, out of the bathtub, causing me to fall
hard against the wall so I did not drop her.  I found her on the floor
between her swivel chair and an end table, and had to keep stuffing pillows
under her to get her elevated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She is home now, since Friday.  I feed her, clean her, change her, and
everything else, being sure to walk her once an hour around the house to
build up her strength.  She is 90 years old.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the meantime, I am in a new house.  I was without a telephone for a
month.  My printer and scanner quit, so I had to order new.  Those are nice,
with a lot of features.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ready to go again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BUDDY to DWAYNE):  Glad to hear from you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS): Note the following message from Captain Pike to
Gul Dukat, "Thank you for the gift of Deep Space 9, I look forward
to future cooperation between the Federation and the Cardassian Empire."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to BOARD): I can not receive mail at my new house yet.  No trash
pickup either.  I am receiving mail at my previous address, and packages at
my new address.  My cell phone is 1-540-226-5571 <i>((See above note on
the phone number, is this right?))</i>.  My new house phone is
1-540-898-3386.  Cheaper for me if you call the house phone.  Waiting to
hear from you, Jeff.  Oh, more than 10 inches of snow last night.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT'S MUSHROOM WAFFLE WORKS-WORLD): Oof.  Bad hallucinations in the south.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to ITALY).  I say, ole chap!  Get that threatening army out of North
Africa, or I will.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ELFERIC-UNCA BERNIE): I am sorry, Dear Uncle, but the Toadfather's 
armies were milling around in a coffee-clutch and France was looking 
so ripe for an invasion.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to UNCA BERNIE): And that is the way of the world.  
We don't want to be in the way of an escape from boredom!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to GERMANY):  Glad to be playing with old friends.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ERIC to JIM-BOB): Terry wasn't able to make our Deadwoodcon last weekend 
because he was back in the hospital.  I'm going to call him to see how he's doing.
Tom Howell, his girlfriend Barb, and John Biehl were here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to ERIC): We're all sorry to hear that.
I hope they can get things under control soon!
Send him our best wishes if you talk to him!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to TURKEY):  If they can't get you out, I will have to come in after
you.  How did you think you would be able to keep Bulgaria, anyway?  Think!
I will be advising my allies, and that will smart.

2) Dan Gorham is taking over as England, but complains that none of
you responded to his messages.  Thus, I am granting his request for
a delay.  If all of you would be so kind to welcome him to the game
BEFORE you snub him, I would appreciate it.  There will be no further
delay, fall orders will be due Christmas Eve.
I have orders on file for most of you, check with me if you're unsure
of what they are.
