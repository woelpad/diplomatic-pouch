<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we will see.
There is interest in a NEW regular Diplomacy game and a Breaking Away game.  Sign up, let's see if we can get seven for Dip and six for Breaking Away!

This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

 Subject: That time again...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What if they gave a baseball season and Summer decided to not show up?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The good news is that it looks like we could be talking 
about the Bruins and Blackhawks well into June.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The bad news is that they might be able to play the Stanley Cup Finals 
in outdoor games at Wrigley and Fenway.  
Actually, given the Cubs' and Red Sox' predicted fortunes that might be good news.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So where do we start this year?

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Goz, warrengoesle of wowway.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt--></i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I only bring this up because the second line might be the only prediction I get
right all year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So today's question to the Red Sox fans is:  just why do you think Jake Peavy 
is the answer to any question that Boston has?  
He's one pitch from having the arm and career being over.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Goz, warrengoesle of wowway.com</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((The answer is that it is a MINOR deal for Boston, where they didn't give
up anything they wanted to keep.  You all know buy low and sell high?
Well, Jose Iglesias will NEVER be worth as much as he is right now, while
he still has a season long decent batting average.  Everyone here knows it
wasn't just a "temporary slump" he was in, but what he is batting now is
what he is.  The early season hits were such an amazing sequence of luck
and good bounces as NEVER will be seen in baseball again.  The Red Sox
pulled a steal, and of course the REAL story of the week is Biogenesis,
and the fact that Detroit's shortstop will be out for 50 games.  Iglesias
will make all the plays in the field and define a new line.... remember
the Mendoza line?  Well, the Iglesias line might be .100!))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((So, on the other side, Peavy just needs to pitch for a while so Workman
can shore up the bullpen for the Sox (where he is better suited) until
other pitchers are ready.  I would say if Peavy gets them to September,
it's an all even deal, the rest is gravy.  I expect a decent amount of
gravy, but if you're right, it's still a good deal for the Red Sox.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was thinking of posting an email looking back at pre-season predictions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim is correct about the Peavy trade.  The Red Sox are selling high.  
I would add that I think that there's a chance that, in the long run, 
Iglesias becomes as valuable of a SS as Vizquel or Ozzie, both of whom 
improved their batting as their careers progressed (esp. Vizquel).  
I think the low prediction would be that he'll have a Rey Ordones 
type of career, brilliant glove but no hitting.  
I suspect he'll be in the middle.  
He probably won't ever have a 3-month stretch of hitting .400 again, 
but if he hits .250 he's a legitimate major league SS, given his glove.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for Peavy, who knows what he'll bring?  I definitely (and excusably) 
did not anticipate John Lackey pitching better this season than he ever 
had since joining the Red Sox.  
That and a few other things have the Sox far ahead of where I had put 
them in the preseason.  
The Rays are about where I thought they would be, as are the Tigers.  
I drank the Kool-Aid with the Angels, but I would not have anticipated 
how well the A's are playing this season.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now the playoffs look like: Rays, Sox, Tigers, As, and somebody else, 
probably O's or Indians.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My big mistake in the NL was overrating the Nationals.  
After underrating their ability to win games with a weak offense last season, 
I thought they had found some formula.  
So the weak offense is hurting them, one year later.  
Don't follow the NL much, but it looks like the Braves, Reds, and 
Cardinals are about what I expected, while the Pirates are much 
better than anyone might have thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who else is there?  Giants?  Dodgers? Puig is a revelation, obviously, 
but aside from that I don't have much to say.  
Only one team from the West since the Central is so strong this year.  
Can't remember who I picked in the West: probably the Giants, and 
that's definitely a collapse I didn't foresee.  
But then again, I mostly ignore the NL 
(except for any radio chatter about the Nats that I pick up.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Finally, please come to Tempest for Dipcon in October.

<i>((I'll do an update on the Iglesias/Peavy deal closer to publication date,
the very first evidence is that Jose already got one hit (a typical bloop
single) for Detroit and Peavy starts tonight for the Red Sox.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I'm revisiting my predictions, mostly not doing too badly.  I should have
put money on them, I'd be in line to win pretty big.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL East: I had it right but didn't predict the Blue Jays quite down far
enough.  I actually still think I could be completely correct here as the
Blue Jays might make a late run to get to third and I won't be surprised
if the Rays win and the Red Sox have the wild card.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL Central: I completely nailed this division so far, Cleveland won't
quite get to the Wild Card.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL West: Like pretty much everyone else, I thought the A's would be good,
but not quite that good, and thought the Angels wouldn't be this bad.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL East: Again, I completely nailed this division, including the
regression of the Nationals.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL Central: I had most of this (the Cardinals surprisingly doing well) but
didn't quite have the Pirates doing THIS well.  That's the surprise of the
year so far.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL West: So, early in the year, I had this right, but NOW?  My Giants'
team collapse has been really disappointing, and I was completely wrong
about Lincecum doing a huge comeback.  So, other than the Giants, who it
was stupid to predict to repeat, I'm in good shape on my playoff
predictions..... now Detroit vs. Atlanta, if we leave out the Giants.  And
I like the Red Sox better actually to beat Detroit.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Bryce Harper is still going to be a superstar, but is slowed a bit in his
development this year.  And PED suspensions are about to be announced.  I
wish they would get them over with, so we can move on, with ARod joining
Manny in Taiwan or something.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((PUBLICATION TIME UPDATE: Iglesias has batted .286 for Detroit (with a flurry 
of his trademark bloop hits in the last week to catch up), and Peavy is 2-1 
with a 3.31 ERA and a WHIP under 1.00.  You tell me... I think it is clear
so far and will be more clear by the end of the season.
I wasn't quite right on the Iglesias line yet though.))</i>

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started in January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my next game.
Yes, in C-Diplo, you can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.
There is about to be a huge uptick in games starting as September approaches
in a few days.
My game is waiting for more players to start, won't you come join me???

1) There seems to be a fairly wide range of coordination this turn, I wonder

Any interest in joining the new game?
Or maybe the new Breaking Away game?
But then, maybe we're NOT going to keep going...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The EF two-way draw is voted down. A five way DIAS is proposed and Mike
votes for it as he resigns.  If everyone else accepts it, the game will end
with Summer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I left Mike's a STP off the map by accident last season.  
I did have an order to hold, so hold it did, now we see it on the list and map.
Not related to this at all, Mike has asked to resign for personal reasons.
We'll miss him, thanks for playing, Mike, and hope all goes well for you!
If we go on, Heath Davis-Gardner is called as a standby.  Map is in last issue,
just add the St.Pete army.

2) This one sort of ground to a three way draw.  
Thanks to everyone who played.  Endgame statements 
still are welcome, I haven't received any yet and ran out of time.
I'll print the SC chart for sure next time.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i>
World DipCon was held in Paris last weekend, and it was great fun
being on Facebook and watching it play out game by game over the 
weekend.
Of course, they still play that damnable C-Diplo over there, with 
the resulting last turns play to grab centers.
As usual that played out in spades leading to the top board and the
WDC Championship this year:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 presents all the details of the results.
The top board ended up with Frenchmen Diplomacy superstars Cyrille Sevin
and Gwen Maggi, also French newcomers Rene Van Rooijen and Pascal Maguy.
Fellow Economist, Native Frenchman, and current Canadian Nicolas Sahuguet.
Those were the Francophones, then we had two stellar native English
speakers, perhaps the two best in the world, Edi Birsan from the US
and Toby Harris from the UK.
My bet prior to the tournament had been on Toby.
Well, you know the way C-Diplo comes down to the last season.
It could have been Toby, playing Germany, or Cyrille, playing
France, but not Edi, playing England.
It reminded me of the last time I played at WDC in Paris, where
Edi played Kingmaker.
Edi chose Cyrille, and Cyrille is now a three-time WDC champion.
Toby tells me <i>"Brian Dennehy Lives!"</i>, he must be terribly
disappointed.
Of course, the worst part is that MY prediction was wrong.
But I still think Toby is the player I'd most want to go to war with,
though Edi and Cyrille are great.
By the way, over on the other side of the board, Nicolas Sahuguet
was playing Austria and he also came up just short.
In the unforgiving C-Diplo, Cyrille had 7 centers and Toby and Nicolas
had 6.  Give me Belgium or give me death!!!
Anyway, I really wish I had been there, I will go back to Paris
to play Diplomacy again one of these years.

The final last word is that Don Williams, as always, has his birthday
precisely one month before mine, so he gets to turn 56 first this 
Thursday, wish him the best and most happy one!</b>
