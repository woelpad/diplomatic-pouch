<br /><br />I'm late again this time mostly because of <i>Diplomacy World</i> as I put a 
big push around the time of the original deadline here to get <i>DW</i> out
the door.  Issue #91, Fall 2004, is at www.diplomacyworld.org
in an Adobe PDF download format.  
Go look at it NOW!!!!
It is clearly the best issue of the recent era, under Tim Haffey's hand.
In particular, the interview I did with World DipCon Champion Yann Clouet
is a real page turner!!!
But I am going to hold off on all the end-game things for ONE more issue,
since I don't want to hold this up any longer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's time for another Jim-Bob plea.... you all know that John Caruso continues
to run his baseball league for all of us who REALLY hate Rotisserie style
Baseball Leagues because they don't actually PLAY any games, but really like
the competition and comradery of that type of league.
Also, for all of you who are United fans, this league has some similar 
characteristics.
Finally, the actual PLAYERS are the real players in baseball, and they stay in 
our league until they are out of baseball, then they retire.
This also makes it fun that as you plan your team, you have to plan how long
players in baseball will remain active.
We are short SIX players and John says no one cares about him or his style of league
any more.
While this is just John being John,
prove him wrong, join up.
I think we will need to get ALL six willing to join since John is going to
put one &#252;nowned" team in each division and he wants it to be fair.
We're entirely an E-Mail league now, so there are not the high game fees that 
scared people off in the past.
I know some former league members are out there, and I'm also sure that new
league members are out there.
Just ask me, and I'll E-Mail you the kind of information you get during the
season to track your teams.
Please, we must have SIX people out there who are interested!!
I can threaten to shut down <i>TAP</i> if people don't volunteer.
That usually wakes people up.
I've had at least ONE response to this....

You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings, once he gets back from the 
vacation that he's on right now.
Really, you can.
And Dick himself is lonely and he hangs out there even more
than John does, make Dick Martin's day, go to phantomempire!
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can start RIGHT NOW to pick up one of
the unclaimed teams and play it this year!
My team is still heading toward the playoffs, continuing 
to lead my division over the likes of Dicko's Baltimore Oriole team.
Contact John at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the

We have added a European continental representative, most of this

into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl

But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

WorldMasters 2002 Email Diplomacy Tournament Semi-Finals are on-going.
Adam Silverman is looking for a chance to win Game 1, Ray Setzer is 
playing an interesting risky game as Germany in Game 3, Steve Emmert
is getting crunched in Game 5, and Toby Harris is continuing his
passionate shrinking defense in Game 7, among prominent Americans
and subbers to this szine.
This Final Board game always is VERY exciting to watch.
I'll let you all know where you can find it when the group is set.
The big stuff going on right now is a lot of crossgame dirty dealing
that seems to be aimed mostly at getting certain people into eighth
place.
Eighth place really means nothing, but it is the FIRST alternate for the
finals, and I'm sure people have been pointing out that the first alternate
HAS made it into the finals before and done well (Lee Simpson).
There also is lots of handwringing about crossgaming in the semis which
wasn't "supposed to be able to happen".  Just shows you, if there is
a Diplomacy tournament and a rule, SOMEONE will find a way to twist it
into the game.

A's - Sox comment:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've just started following baseball again in the last couple of
years, and I'm somewhat surprised it's considered perfectly acceptable
for players to claim catches they didn't take.  A fielder CAN feel
through the glove whether the ball is coming up or down at him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The press considers it perfectly acceptable; I've seen several instances
over the last two days about how the umpire made a mistake, and even
learned that he was a minor-league umpire stepping in for an umpire
stranded by Hurricane Frances, but I haven't seen a word about the
lack of sportsmanship in claiming the catch.  The A's seem to consider
it perfectly acceptable too; Ramirez (the fielder involved) was
intentionally walked in the 9th rather than beaned, and I don't think
they were short on bullpen arms.

<i>((Among Diplomacy players, that is an interesting discussion to have,
isn't it.
As the nephew of an umpire, with that perspective, I think the umpire does
have the responsibility to get the call right, he doesn't need or want
help from the players in making the call, even if they were going to
"call the foul" on themselves.
The only sport that comes to mind where this happens (and notably it also is
the only sport I can think of without some kind of conspicuous referee)
is golf.  
There you are expected to call double hits on yourself, for example, and
you regularly see golfers doing just that, even when no one but themselves
would know.
I think in other sports there are certain standards of sportsmanship
that evolve, just as we have in Diplomacy, and after that you do whatever
you can to try to win.
In some cases, like basketball fouls, I think it would affect the playability
and style of the game if you called fouls on yourself.
I think it is good for the game that the players are aggressive, and play
aggressively, and then the referees are the ones who work to reign it in.
Again, with golf as the example, golf is not that kind of aggressive game.
But, with issues like "claiming the catch" in baseball, it's a tough
gray area. 
Another one that is related is the "phantom second base tag".  
Here, the baseball player tries to make the "true play" and may run close to the
edge if he is worried about getting hurt (on the outfield catch by diving on
the ground, or in the infield by the runner taking the fielder out) to do the play
and get the out, with the least danger to themselves.  
I do think that the umpire making the call is completely appropriate here.
Being a professional referee is not simply a matter of making the mathematical/physics
best call, it is a matter of being the arbiter of the game.
Sometimes umpires and other referees go too far with this.
And certainly any umpire is going to want to get the outfield catch call RIGHT
more than they are with the "phantom second base tag" where their goal is 
to see whether the second baseman has gone over the "imaginary line" around
the base and timing.
But I don't think you need or want the players calling things on themselves
in baseball.
Blame the umpire for not getting the call right if you want, but don't bring
instant replay into baseball.
Recognize that the debate and the play is part of the game.
Really.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((As the major league baseball season nears its end, just for fun, let's look
at the picks that Goz and I made and see who came closer to getting things right....
I think we're both in a bit of trouble with our WS predictions other than him
liking the Yankees and me liking the Red Sox, as I picked the Red Sox to beat
the Giants and he picked the Yankees to beat the Astros.
But let's just look at the divisions....))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL East: Goz nailed the Braves winning the 13th title in a row.
That gives him props period as I predicted the Braves would finish last.
Early on, I looked like I might have something, but GOZ overwhelmingly
wins this one.  The only part I had right was that I predicted that
there would be no way that the NL East would produce the wild card,
and they won't now that Florida is mired in a losing streak.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL Central: Goz said that Cubs, Cards, and Astros were the class, but
that the Cardinals were the worst of those three, where they're clearly
the best.  But I also had the Cards finishing third and thought that the
Brewers would make a run and it looks like they're finishing last.
So Goz takes this division too.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL West: Finally one that Jim-Bob has a decent prediction.... I had the
Padres making a run, but so did Goz.  
We both picked the Giants to win it and the Dodgers for third, so this
one's a push.))

((AL East: Sigh, it doesn't look like the Red Sox will make it and the
Yankees will win the division again, Goz takes this one too, also he
predicted that Baltimore would be the next best team in the division.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL Central: Tough one here, neither of us had Minnesota winning again.
Goz thought Chicago and then Cleveland (who are going to finish second
and third) while I had more faith in Tony Pena than he deserved, and 
the Royals are dead last, so give this one to Goz too.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL West: Finally, I win one going away... Goz thought that Seattle would
win the WILD CARD, while I correctly predicted that they would fall way
down to the VERY bottom of the division.
I also predicted that Texas would be right there with the A's and Angels
to the end.
I predicted the final order of finish would be Angels, A's, Rangers.
It might finish that way, though Oakland is ahead as I write.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Playoffs: So now the real question is whether the Red Sox will beat
the Yankees in the playoffs. If they do, I get to laugh a bit at Goz.
If the Yankees win and get to the World Series, well then, he gets it.
Right now, I think that the Yankees and the Red Sox are the two best
teams out there, yes, even better than the Cardinals, but there could
be some surprises in the playoffs.
We'll see..... but at least I faced the music, congrats Goz, you got
me again!!!
But I have another chance in the playoffs.))</i>

Dear Jim, On Sept. 9th I'll be transferred to the Federal Prison Camp
in McKean, PA.
I'm told that's in the northwestern part of the state, near the Ohio
border.
The process could take one day, or it could take four weeks.
<i>((See new address below.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My <i>DW</i> letter may have come across slightly in the tone of patting 
myself on the back.
That was not my intention.
<i>((Nah, not really, just frustrated that it is so hard to keep <b>DW</b>
going properly and you being where you are.))</i>
I was just mentioning some of what I liked seeing in <i>DW</i> and elsewhere....
obviously if I liked something, I made an effort to include it in the zines
I published.
I'll try to give you a longer letter after my move is complete, with any 
news or information I think is of interest.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My favorite albums of 2003 (geez, I still call them albums)
<i>((No problem, so do I.))</i>
continue to be "Volume 4" from Joe Jackson and the Tori Amos album whose
name escapes me, Charlotte's Red or some other takeoff on Charlotte's Web...
something web I think.
I'm at a disadvantage because they don't seem very interested in letting
me go to Dallas on a furlough to look through my CD collection.
<i>((No, indeed, but I'm happy to assist.
I really like that Joe Jackson album too, he is growing into such a
wide ranging mature musician, I still remember the first time I heard <b>
Look Sharp!</b> and was stunned by its freshness.
And Tori Amos' CD is called <b>Scarlet's Walk</b> and I've seen it in stores
with weird web packaging, which is why you are thinking Web, beyond the 
links to Charlotte's Web.
Tori also has a live DVD that has just come out with a lot of fanfare, 
it's her live in sunny Florida, which is a bit unfortunate right now as
Florida prepares for its fourth hurricane of the season!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Volume 4 was so-named because it's the fourth album Joe did with his original
quartet.
Anyone who held an appreciation for Joe's lyrics or musical ability in the
past owes it to themselves to check it out.
At some point this was the natural progression nof his music.
From "new wave" to produced pop to modern thematic to Symphony #1
(another great album and a Grammy winner)... back to square one.
But Volume 4, while reminiscent of his early work, is tighter, more
sophisticated, and (for lack of a better term) more grown-up than
the rebellious work of <i>Look Sharp!</i> or <i>I'm the Man</i>.
Instead of looking at the future with disdain, Joe looks at the 
present with an experienced eye or even back at the past with
some melancholy and some embarrassment.
<i>((Yes, do you know his earlier song "Hometown"?  This is a favorite
of mine from him middle period and is one of the most sensitive songs
of that type I've ever heard.
It moves me nearly to tears every time I hear it.
On this one, he has that song that goes something like "For just a moment
I almost believe in love at first light" which reminds me of that sensibility.
And "Thugs R'Us" is laugh out loud hilarious!!  
(it's about those wimpy suburban kids listening to hip-hop)))</i>
Even though it has been a year since I've heard the album, I can still listen
to all of it (or almost all of it) in my head.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Take It Like a Man" teases for 15 or 20 seconds, until the unmistakable
sounds of Joe's keyboards appear.
An upbeat song, it chides the subject to get ready to be looked down on the
way he has been looking down on his newly-empowered woman.
"Still Alive", my personal favorite, is merely a tuneful ode to surviving
a break-up.
"Awkward Age" is elder Joe, trying to explain to a sixteen-year-old that
things will get better - but that she shouldn't expect to have anything
figured out by the time she reaches Joe's age - lyrics reminiscent of
"Flying" in "Night Music".  (The older I get the more stupid I feel)
<i>((Damned straight, it is amazing, isn't it.
I had much more confidence back then that I really knew what I was doing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Really from start to finish it's an immensely enjoyable ride.
"Chrome" sings to a now-famous friend and how cold they've become.
"Love at First Light" explores that cloudy feeling when you're trying
to decide if a one-night stand has anything further to offer.
<i>((That's it, that's the song I was thinking about above.
Just as an aside, you know, when I do these, I read the letters as I'm 
typing them into the szine, so I don't "read ahead".
It keeps my comments fresher, I think.))</i>
"A Little Bit Stupid" celebrates the glam-rock age in foot-stomping
fashion.
"Dirty Martini" - Joe's tribute to his obsession with New Orleans.
And then it closes with "A Touch of Gray" which is a song I mentally
link with "Got the Time" if for no other reason than the steaming
speed of the tempo.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think I left a few songs off the list but you get the idea.
And they all translated wonderfully to live performance, as the
CD remains just the four-piece band with no heavy production.
The weekend of March 15, 2003 remains the best I ever had - I
saw Joe Jackson live in Dallas after waiting 20 years to do so, and
met Heather with whom I hope 20 years is but a small fraction of
our time together.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Anyway, let's talk about more fun stuff, very interesting, 
I wonder why you waited so long.
I've seen Joe Jackson a number of times, but one extremely memorable one
was just about 20 years precisely before you saw him - and also in Dallas!!!
I didn't have a car and had to ride my bike and I very distinctly remember
that this club Joe was playing in was on the west side of town somewhere and I
had to ride over the long dark passage across the dry river bed to get there.
I also saw the Talking Heads in the same club somewhere around the same time.
But I'm pretty sure Joe's concert was in March.
It was the tour for <b>Night and Day</b> as I recall clearly him playing all
of those songs.
I think I reviewed it in one of the early <b>Boob Report</b>'s too, but I don't
have very good electronic records of that time, does anyone else remember?
(teehehehe)
But I recall writing about Sue Hadjopoulas' brilliant percussion (who has been
on everything since but most definitely is NOT one of the original four - the
previous three albums, the first three, were <b>Look Sharp!, I'm the Man,
and Beat Crazy.</b>
Graham Maby is the only one of the other three that went along with most of
the rest of Joe's albums.
Anyway, that was fun, I'm going to dig out some Joe Jackson albums as soon 
as the Red Sox lose to the Yankees again..... no wait, as I write, on the
date on the header, the Red Sox have come back and gotten to Tanyon Sturtze
in the Yankees bullpen and are ahead, maybe they're not dead yet, can they
still win the division.... am I a fan or what....))</i>

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
Fall 1916 was two game years by that measure.
If Turkey is missing TWO of its home centers in Winter 1917,
I think we are still going to advance to the next level of
voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be
allowed with failure to vote equalling a yes.
If any other significant movement or centers change hands
then that will be another story, of course.
This does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick already is way ahead of this pace).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EL VEZ to SAND): I hope your manager figured out his problems 
and that you made it to 45!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to EL VEZ AND JOHNNY PESO): It seems to me that your bigger
problem was with not getting anyone who was going to end up on 43,
there were lots of people who were likely to end up on 45, and did.
I think Dave Partridge's Spades is the only one who could have stopped
on 43, and he elected to cut you guys off from the main pack.
