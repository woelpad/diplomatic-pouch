<br /><br />Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! 
I'm truly thankful that I've made it through this year!!
The main new news on me is that if everything keeps going well, I come
off of chemotherapy at the end of February, and then I can finish the
recovery from the treatment.
That is tremendous as an outcome from where I started.
Now I'm looking forward to running a Diplomacy tournament at TotalCon
in Mansfield, MA February 19-21. 
Y'all should come!!!
The new Kendo Nagasaki game keeps going, I like running them and
I also like playing in them... mostly.  Plenty of time to join still.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That all should keep the szine cranking and I'd like to start another regular
Diplomacy game in addition to the Breaking Away that's getting close to six!
Wishing all the rest of you who are struggling with 
health issues similar good news!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
I'm set on continuing my GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to help or what you
want to play, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock and Mario Huys are now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.
The address is still:
http://diplom.org/.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are currently 75 members of the official <i>TAP</i> subscriber list, but that's
down because in the move, there were some addresses dropped.
http://lists.asciiking.com/mailman/listinfo/tap is the new list website.
YOU need to make sure you're on this list.
There you can check your subscribing options and whether you're registered.
Register if you want to get <i>TAP</i> E-Mailed regularly.
Some people have had trouble with the attachments, so I have switched to sending the link
in the announcements, we'll see if that helps.
Please let me know.

<i>((For upcoming cons around the world: http://www.diplom.org/Face/cons/index.php, 
success, we have badgered all the Con directors to post their Cons, so it is reasonably
up to date now.
And there remains lots of interest in the FTF community, and linking E-Mail/Web players
to FTF.  
Now is the time I'm ramping up the slight deviation adjustment in running my February 
Diplomacy tournament, leadoff to the Nor'Easter.
Since TempleCon moved itself to August, great for them horrible for me, I've cut the tie
of... what ten years running Diplomacy there?
Robert Rousse and others had been hoping for some time that I'd move over to TotalCon, 
which actually has WAY more boardgamers and is a bit later in February, this year
February 19-21, just up the road in Mansfield, MA, halfway between Providence and 
Boston.  This also is a plus for our Boston gamers and for the Vermonters coming down
it's closer too.  You might still prefer to fly into Providence's airport, but as noted
it's equidistant between there and Logan Airport in Boston.
We can work out pickups and such.
I also have two hotel rooms reserved down the street at the Red Roof Inn, that are
pay what you want/can, as usual,
http://www.totalcon.com has more particulars.
There is a way of getting a group registration rate, if you want that contact me.
As of this date, pre-registration hasn't opened quite yet.
I know I'm celebrating getting to do this again, come join me!!!
Also, the Facebook page for European Tournament Diplomacy, https://www.facebook.com/groups/1500292310187264/,
Diplomacy in Europe, has been really active and the place to be in the hobby these days.
If you're on Facebook, hook up there!))</i>

SU is having a strange season.  They looked so good in the Bahamas, but since then they have some bad losses.  
I'm hoping for .500 in the ACC and being on the NCAA bubble, but that might be a stretch.  
Nice about the Friars.  Of course, we are all waiting for their 7'-2" transfer to take the 
Dome floor next year as he'll be great in the middle of the zone.

I'd love to do another game of Spy Diplomacy, but it requires commitment that seems in short supply
these days, but let me know if you want me to reprint the rules.
I really, really want to get the Diplomacy and Breaking Away games started as soon as possible, come on, help me out!!!
Hugh Polley also asked me to print these rules for playing short that I might want to play around with in 
here, any interest in that?

REGULAR DIPLOMACY: need seven for another game start, we have five.
We have Edward Innes, Fred Wiedemeyer, Marc Ellinger, Melinda Holley, (she's feeling better YAY!!! so I hope she'll still be in) and
Gavin Begbie.

1) The Concession to England did fail, but it didn't matter as England got past 18 centers on his own.
Congratulations to Drew as this game really did go on a LONG time, with the chunk of time with
slower deadlines before the estimable Doug Kent got me back on schedule.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Thanks to Paul Rauterberg for standing in for one turn, thanks Melinda for playing so long.
For those of you who haven't heard, Melinda is recovering brilliantly and is feeling much
better.  Hurray, Melinda!!!

<br /><br /> <b>HINT to the Person with the Closest Geographic Guess:</b> We each had serious
disputes with our respective Popes and the authority of the Catholic Church. (Yeah, that
means Jesus is NOT aligned with the closest guess...)

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
We're right up against Christmas, lots of wrapping and singing and getting together with family
to do. 
So I'll be brief here.
Speaking very seriously, I'm incredibly lucky to be here and I miss our friend Don Williams,
who had a much less successful course of treatment, fiercely.
I hope you all have family and friends and togetherness this holiday season and we will see
you all again in the New Year.</b>
