David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league thatI am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Our season is just starting so this is the right time to jump in,
you can learn how to manage a team and then ease into planning the
building of one.
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently "in stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ED HENRY - AND JERRY LUCAS FOUND!</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Find Ed Henry and win the fifty buck prize!!
You only have until next issue to find him before the prize drops.
I want to tell Ed about Kathy and all sorts of other things.
There is a "full board" there now, help me out and earn
yourself some cash!!!
Ed Henry was very active in the hobby in the 1980's.
I don't think he's the same Ed Henry who's so famous right now working
on Kiplinger's magazine (writes the Car reviews and is African American),
but he could be.
Ask him and find out!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, and Al found too!!! 
The note that Leslie Obata probably was married and had changed
her name was just the clue needed to crack the case!
See the details below on how Jerry Lucas was tracked down.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe
or Al Pearson is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Leslie Obata Found !

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim-Bob:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received the latest issue of <i>TAP</i>, thank you.
I am disappointed with myself that it took almost a month to find Leslie, but 
this morning, we had a nice long talk on the phone and she agreed to let me 
send you her yahoo email address, below.  A search of public records on line, 
specifically the California Marriage Index showed a Leslie Obata, age 25, 
marrying a Dennis Tom in 1985.  Subsequent searches found two Leslie Tom 
listings in the Bay area.  I called them both.  One disconnected, the other a 
generic prerecorded message.  Left a message with my 800 number and viola.  
Leslie.  She has been in touch with some of the old gang via email and has 
given me my old boss's email who was always closer to Jerry Lucas.  She says 
that she hasn't communicated with him for a couple of years but I am pretty 
sure that I will have his email for you by Monday, or so.  Meanwhile, I told 
her the deal with the reward and she found that somewhat humorous.  She is 
willing to confirm her ID as you would like.  We talked about the time that 
Brenton showed up at her place.  She said that her friend Debbie was with her 
at the time.  Debbie and I later married and divorced after about 6 years and 
I didn't know she was there when Judy Winsome got busted.  Small World.  We 
were all a bit wild back then.  Anyway, after you confirm the identity, apply 
my $25 reward to your mailing expenses and when I find Jerry Lucas, send that 
$25 to Leslie.  After all, it's never really about the money.  Party on, we 
will be in touch.

You were right, Gerry still works for the Postal Service

<br /><br /><i>((Hi Jerry, Tim gets</i> $<i>25 for finding you.  
First off, I always knew you as "Jerry"
while Tim knows you as Gerry, was that another little deception to
hide your existence?  As we've been looking for you, I suspect that
knowing you were a Gerald would really have helped!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I suspect many of your old pals (like especially your fellow postal
employee Gary Coughlan who I never understood why HE couldn't find
you within the USPS) will be interested to hear from you.  Actually,
Tim doesn't "win" until you write me a letter back for publication in
my Diplomacy szine "The Abyssinian Prince".  I remember interacting
with you best in that game we played in Europa Express back in
about 1982.... I could dig up the records, but I want to shoot a quick
note off. Jim Meinel did a Encyclopedia of Dip Szines a few years ago
and here's what it says about "Winsome Losesome" (courtesy of Fred Davis):
"For a couple of years, Jerry Lucas had most of the people in the hobby
fooled into thihnking this zine was actually produced by a lady named
Judy Winsome.  He even drew a portrait of Judy on the masthead.
At some point, Judy lost one of her pigtails in some sort of joke.
There were stories about the girls' soccer team which Judy coached.
I believe Jerry did actually coach a girls' soccer team at the local
high school, so he could report on that fairly straightforwardly.
Despite the nom de plume nonsense, the games were well run on a timely
basis.  This was one zine which continued on an almost monthly
basis right up to the end.  I think it was folded only when its
last game ended.  The writing style was such that Judy sure had
many fooled for quite some time as to her gender."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My szine the Abyssinian Prince is now up to it's 269th issue and
the Diplomacy hobby is alive and very, very well.  Though now
most of it is on the Internet.
Hope to hear from you soon.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Jerry Lucas (Fri, 18 Apr 2003 08:00:30 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hey there.  Great to hear from you.  I was wondering if anyone
remembered <i>Winsome Losesome</i>.  I was proud of its dependability, but
obviously, you take the prize for dependability. Actually Tim has is
wrong and you have it right, it is Jerry.  The spelling Gerry that you
see fairly often now was around when I was young.  Jerry Lewis the
comic? and Jerry Lee Lewis were the only other Jerrys I knew during my
school days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I didn't coach high school, I coached and later managed a girls soccer
team in California Youth Soccer.  We won our local league championship
every year but couldn't do well in the Northern California play offs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I remember <i>TAP</i> and you.  Would like to see the 'zine.  How do I see it
on the internet?  I still have my old Diplomacy sets and a complete set
of <i>Winsome Losesome</i> issues. I've remarried since then and my new wife
would say this stuff is strange, but she thinks I'm strange anyway. For
many years I traded Christmas cards with Jeff Albrecht who I played with
in a 'zine, but that has fallen off now.  He lived in South Dakota the
last I heard from him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Take care, Jim.

<br /><br /><b>Brenton Ver Ploeg (Thu, 17 Apr 2003 11:15:33 -0400)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And to think I almost didn't open the April Fool's edition of TAP!  I 
just read it at my desk, however, and very much enjoyed your <i>Winsome 
Losesome</i> story.  I didn't know that even the games were hoaxes, but I 
never took seriously the possibility that the magazine was authored by 
anyone without a penis so hoaxing the whole thing seems like a sensible 
progression. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The hoax was actually blown the first night I showed up (with a somewhat 
incredulous Doug Beyerlein and his 
less-than-comfortable-with-the-circumstances wife in tow) at "Judy's" 
address somewhere near Palo Alto (she had moved there from a San 
Francisco address that had initially attracted my attention because it 
was only a few blocks from where I lived while in law school there).  
Jerry's half-hearted effort to have his wife claim to be Judy on the 
phone that evening wouldn't have been persuasive anyway...even if she'd 
been able to control her laughter. As far as Leslie and her (real) 
roommates, well, not very many fictions are capable of holding together 
after a couple of questions.  And yes, you were implicated by the 
witnesses, but I figured that telling the whole story was up to Jerry, 
even though I never met or spoke with him directly.  Maybe between you 
and Jim, you'll flush out his version.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hadn't thought of tracing Leslie through the marriage licenses, but it 
would be nice to hit the nostalgia note on birthdays.  If you do it, let 
me know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'll try to send you something about Jerry Lucas/Judy Winsome.  
He submitted his picture for those old <i>Europa Express</i> picture 
contests and that would mean he had a reply that would have been 
published in response to the <i>EE</i> subscribers' guesses about his picture.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:

This should help out my Australian subbers!!

way overwhelmed with 73 teams of 7 players, for a total tournament player roster
of 511!!!
Toby Harris has completed another record first round 18 center victory, gee

And now, I'm facing Toby and others in another "Boasters" game, designed to

 Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby

My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.

Details for Publicity:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
:-)  Sounds good.  The details of the venue are STILL being sewn up *rolling
my eyes*... What's happening at the moment is we'd preferably like to get a
room in the Student centre.  Taylor's friend Rhett has booked one for us, but
unfortunately I don't think it's going to be suitable, it has a conference
like table which is square, but you can walk into the middle of it.  I think
it won't really be possible to comfortably fit all the boards so I've
written back to Rhett to see if it's possible to get any other rooms i.e. one
of Saturday and one on Sunday (all other rooms have other bookings for some
portion of either Saturday or Sunday).  But that aside it is definitely not
a problem to get a classroom for the entire weekend.  So if the Student
centre is nixed then it will be a classroom similar to where Diplomatic
Incident was held.  So MIT is definitely the venue, which exact room is
still fuzzy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tournament will be held on Saturday (2 rounds) and Sunday (one round).
No Friday night round so that those that can't take time off work to travel
can still get to the tournament OK. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have booked a bar for Saturday night on the MIT campus.  The beer is $1.75
for a pint of Sam Adams, $2.00 for a pint of Guinness.  It is the cheapest
beer in Boston, and they're allowed to open till 2am.  It's also the
cheapest rent $50 flat fee, then $8/hr for the bartender.  I was hoping they
could host the entire tournament but alas they won't open early enough
Sat/Sun.
<i>((Spectacular!!!  I may have to find Boston accomodations, instead
of trying to drive.  I can always sleep in one of my two offices....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On Friday night I thought I might hold a BBQ/games evening at my house for
those that arrive that night.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Scoring System is Detour98F - see this URL for more details:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<i>((You all should be able to tell, if you haven't been able to tell
already, that Mel is from New Zealand and this is a pretty good scoring
system, I like it and I don't like too many of them.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tournament will have a central clock, similar to World Dip Con.  I'll
probably allow two 30 second extensions per player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for accommodation.  Hotels throughout Boston look insanely expensive, so
I'm hoping we can billet as many people as possible.  The youth Hostel at
near Hynes Convention Center has rates $35-$40/night (Dorm rooms fit 6
people).  There a couple of hotels with varying degrees of nearness to the
venue offering rooms for $160 - $200 / night for rooms with two double beds
that can fit upto four people.  I'm wondering if it might be possible to sub
the accommodation a bit with the tournament fees, I doubt we'll be able to
sub all of it.  Taylor has a good friend in the Hotel business so that may
or may not be able to help.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hope all this helps.
<i>((Oh, absolutely.... now all you slugs start making plans to get out here!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oh and I thought I'd update the MADip-L description to provide a summary of
tournament information so you could direct people to

"Holes" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The book was nearly directly translate to the movie.  
I guess it helps having the author also do the screen play.  
There were differences.  Stanley wasn't quite the butterball in the movie 
that he was in the book, but that is too minor a nit to pick.  
There were a couple of lines in the book that I missed on the screen.  
One of them might have been too complicated to set up but the
other would have flowed perfectly.  Oh well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Stanley Yelnats the fourth has lived a life of being in the wrong place 
at the wrong time.  
His father and his father's father were just the same.  They
blame it all on Stanley's "No good pig stealing great great
grandfather" who
brought a curse down on the men in the Yelnats family.  When a pair of
sneakers fell from the sky and hit Stanley it was just more of the same. 
Stanley's father was working on a cure for foot odor, 
and so Stanley ran home with the sneakers.  
Well, actually he was running home when he was stopped by
the police and arrested for stealing the sneakers from a homeless charity.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He told the truth and far from setting him free, he was given a choice
between jail and Camp Greenlake.  Camp Greenlake is a facility that takes
trouble youth and builds their character by having them dig holes.  
There are no guards, no walls, and no water for 100 miles in any direction.  
And so a truly wonderful example of Magical Realism begins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are three stories being portrayed.  That of the no good pig stealing
great great grandfather, that of the town of Greenlake 100 years ago when
there was a real lake instead of a barren desert, and Stanley's own
story, where character was built.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Excellent movie.  Take your kids, or lacking kids, just go see it.

<i>((Thanks, Steve, I plan to.... another winning story is the British
"Bend It Like Beckham" about a young Indian girl who wants to play

More realistic than Holes, I think, but just as magical in its own way.
It reminded how much better My Big Fat Greek Wedding could have been
without the sitcom elements.
I'd been watching the previews of this one for some months and 
dashed out to see it as soon as it hit my neighborhood.

"Bullet Proof Monk" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Bullet Proof Monk" is a comic book and the movie is the origin story.  
It starts 60 years in the past in the year of the Ram in a small Chinese
monastery which stands guard over a scroll that contains the words that 
can rule the universe.  The words are so powerful that they bestow eternal
agelessness on their guardian.  Protecting them from the world and the world
from them is a sacred responsibility passed from master to student every
fifth year of the Ram. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie opens with a really nice martial arts exhibition between two monks
on a rope bridge.  Enter the bad guys, Nazis with guns.  The year is 1943 
and one Nazi knows about the power of the scroll and plans to use it to 
cleanse the world.  Flash forward 60 years.  A street thief named Kar 
is running from the police while the monk is running from men in black 
hunting the scroll.
Their paths cross when they both stop to help a child in peril.  The monk
recognizes in Kar some potential.  Despite his occupation, he has a good
heart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kar knows some martial arts moves.  He studies at the Golden Palace, 
a movie theatre that shows nothing but Chinese films.  
Kar lives there and practices the moves he sees on the screen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jade is the daughter of a top Russian Mafia member who is currently doing
time.  She has had lots of real martial arts training.  She hides her
identity when she hangs with the thieves guild.  She too sees some potential
in Kar.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In fact, just about everyone in the movie seems to know some martial arts. 
Not terribly realistic, but remember, it is a comic book, so it has a comic
book story.  But the martial arts were good, the stunts were good, 
the humour was good.  I enjoyed it.

"Spirited Away" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was very lucky to have seen this movie.  I became aware that it was coming 
to the USA several months ago when I saw a small blurb to that effect.  Then, 
nothing.  There was nothing I wanted to see playing at my favorite theatre 
this weekend so I looked around and found "Spirited Away" at the fourth 
theatre I tried.  If any of the other three had something I wanted to see I'd 
have missed a great anime film.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Disney has spared no expense advertising it.  They have spent nothing.  I'm 
not sure why.  Disney purchased the right to show it in the USA, they went to 
the trouble of dubbing it in English, they even put their name on it.  It 
comes to us as Disney's "Spirited Away."  That's pretty much like the postman 
taking credit for the Christmas packages he delivers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But enough.  What about the movie.  Not bad.  Better than not bad.  A 
wonderful tale about a young girl who falls into a magical realm.  She is 
being moved to a new town and a new school, and told that she will make new 
friends.  She doesn't want a new town and a new school and new friends.  She 
wants her old town and her old school and her old friends.  Little girls 
don't always get what they want.  Her father is driving them to their new 
house.  I noticed that he drove on the Japanese side of the road but with a 
USA position steering wheel.  Must be tough to judge the cross traffic right 
turns.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, he misses a turn and they end up going down a dark unsurfaced road.  
Dad is sure that it will all come out all right.  So he presses on rather 
than admit he is lost and turn around.  The road dead ends at what Dad 
figures is an abandoned theme park.  Rather than waste the trip down the dirt 
road he decides to explore.  "Chihiro" doesn't want to explore, the place 
gives her the creeps.  But Dad pretty much does what he wants.  So he and Mom 
go into the place, and Chihiro goes along rather than wait in the car.  Her 
parents catch a scent of some really good food, and follow their noses to a 
restaurant with platters of great food and no people.  Chihiro doesn't want 
to get into trouble and so takes a pass on eating.  Her parents decide that 
they have cash and credit cards, so what the heck.  They dig in, making 
figurative pigs of themselves. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Chihiro looks around a bit and meets a boy named Haku who tells her that she 
must leave before the sun sets or something terrible will happen.  Chihiro 
runs back to her parents, who by this time are literal pigs.  Panicked, she 
runs to escape, but it is too late.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And so a truly wonderful fantasy begins.

"Phone Booth" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a one person show.  Colin Farrell is `Stu Shepard' a fast talking 
sleazy publicist who takes off his wedding ring before calling a young 
actress he fantasizes about.  He lies for a living.  He has more nerve and 
more spin than a politician.  He makes a call from a phone booth every day.  
He doesn't want the call on his cell record.  He doesn't want his wife to 
know about the call.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When the phone rings, he answers it.  The voice on the other end tells him 
that there is a high powered rifle aimed at him.  If he hangs up the phone, 
he will die.  Stu tries to put a spin on it, to pay off the threatener with 
promises.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The two talk.  The caller wants Stu to be honest.  Stu doesn't actually know 
what honest is.  A difficult situation.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When Stu threatens to call the bluff, he learns that it isn't a bluff.  A 
pimp who wants Stu out of the phone booth is shot and killed.  The people on 
the street think Stu killed the pimp.  The caller lets Stu know that if he 
tries to tell them what is going on, he will die.  A very difficult 
situation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Collin Farrell made it very real.  I've seen him now in three very different 
roles.  He was the `Recruit'  he was the petulant super-villain `Bullseye; in 
`Dare Devil' and now he brings us Stu Shepard who grows from fast talking 
spin doctor to a vulnerable human being right before out eyes.

"A Man Apart" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Vin Diesel can be very intense.  He plays `Sean Vetter' an ex-gangbanger 
turned cop.  He and his crew are making a dent in the drug traffickers.  It's 
sort of like making a dent in the ocean.  They manage to arrest an illusive 
cartel head, only to have a mysterious `Diablo' step in to take his place.  
Diablo orders a hit on Vetter.  Gunmen come to his house and in the 
confusion, kill Sean's wife.  Sean goes a bit crazy.  Very violently crazy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The actual story has a few logic gaps, but while you watch it unfold Vin 
Diesel holds your attention and you hardly notice the story flaws.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am growing more and more impressed with him.  Good movie.  Not great, not

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim, I thought I might want to update you on what I've been doing
lately, since I'm unemployed again and have a lot of time on my hands.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I do not count running my game company as employment. It doesn't
generate nearly enough money, and I am regularly cheated out of what
money I do make. You can find my basic information at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.seraphimguard.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 basically I publish anime/manga based
role-playing games, usually electronically. I wouldn't mind getting into
a PBEM Dip game but I don't currently own a Diplomacy set. The ones from
Hasbro are simply too expensive and older sets are too rare. I did get
to watch the tournament at last year's Dragonflight in Seattle, although
I did not participate. It was fun watching these guys cheat and lie all
in the name of good fun and free Microsoft product.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Hey, I send you maps and you also can get maps with all the
province names easily on the Internet.
Plus the rules are on the Internet too (see above).
David Partridge has a regular Dip opening down below in his subszine.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now my main obsessions in fandom are RPGs and anime, not
necessarily in that order. That my games are anime-based is hardly
coincidental. My "unmanly" preoccupation with shoujo manga roleplaying
has not yet earned me the scorn of the mental health professionals I
deal with on a regular basis.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And why should it??  I don't see any reason for that.
You have a personality and you own it.  I can't see how any 
self-respecting mental health professional would do that.
But I could always be wrong.  The issue usually is how
mentally one deals with one's interests and hobbies in
relating to others.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course, the question is whether I will be continuing to deal
with them. Mental health care in Oregon has been slashed almost to the
point of non-existence already, and the final stroke is on the way. Soon
I will not be able to get the counseling, assistance and medication that
keeps me even mildly functional. In other words, thanks to the venality
of the Oregon legislature and the stinginess of the Oregon taxpayers
there will be little to distinguish me from a stark raving loon (make
that a stark raving loon with diabetes - I was recently diagnosed with
the disease, but the state refuses to pay for testing equipment and
supplies at all). The crisis line tonight had a great deal of difficulty
persuading me not to kill myself on the spot, because the impression I
get is that Oregon would be happier if I were dead and damned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((We care too, you know - I asked Michael if he really wanted
this all printed in its entirety and he really wanted it.
You all may recall that Michael was very active in the hobby in
the mid-late 1980's.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Being mentally ill is a royal pain. I personally think this is
something that does not happen to a good person. Thus all mentally ill
people are evil somehow. Treating mental illness with anything other
than ball ammunition is a waste of time. (I've been learning about guns,
not from practical experience thanks heavens, but from designing a
modern-day anthropomorphic RPG. I highly recommend Green Ronin Games'
"Ultramodern Firearms D20" to any gamer interested in the various ways
people can inflict bodily harm on each other from some distance away.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I recently had to move to a lower-rent apartment that doesn't
even have a full kitchen. My new address is:
Michael Hopcroft, 523 SW 13th Ave. #719, Portland, OR 97205

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Blazers, of course, have no chance of getting out of the
first round of the playoffs - again. I wish that just once we'd miss
the playoffs so we could get a lottery pick. Besides, this team of
morally culpable people is not particularly worthy of being at the
pinnacle of their profession. Even Paul Allen, the ultimate absentee
owner playing with his toys, is getting fed up with this team's
off-court behavior. Right now there are five players on the Blazers'
active roster who by rights ought to be doing time instead of fighting
over PT. And it's really sad for those who still want to see
professional athletes as role models.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Didn't you guys once have Jermaine O'Neal and then trade him in
one of the worst deals of the last decade to the Pacers, for who???
Dale Davis or someone like that???
Make a few more deals like that, and you'll be right there.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The hockey playoffs have been much more interesting to me so
far. The Mighty Ducks sweeping Detroit away was quite a shock, as they
are a much less talented team than the Red Wings. I'm not even convinced
they have such a fantastic goaltender - just that he had a fantastic
series. I expect Anaheim to depart in the next round. I'd been following
Vancouver and Ottawa all season, and while it looks like Vancouver is
done Ottawa is showing a lot of promise. The Senators have a strong
Portland link; their star forward Marian Hossa (sp?) is a former
Portland Winter Hawk from his junior hockey days. He's darn good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I signed up for the Internet baseball package and then, all of a
sudden, my RealPlayer stopped working. I'm hoping this is just a
temporary thing, as I love listening to games from all over the country.
Having a broadband connection is lovely - paying the bill is going to
be a nightmare, though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the sportsgame front, one of my old friends is working on an
updated Statis-Pro basketball player card set so that he can get our old
league re-started. And I discovered a computer game called Action! PC
Football (no relation to the Action! System role-playing game) and have
played about two dozen Internet games. It's a great simulation for draft
leagues, but for some reason the leagues I'm in have a very hard time
holding together. I swear it's not my fault!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Back to the sportsgame front, I understand Diamond Mind is
working on a new edition of their computer baseball game. This edition
will include full internet play and sadly is only for Windows 95 and
above. I guess it needs the long file names. Action! makes a baseball
game too, but I've found it incredibly buggy. Still, I miss the
challenge of going face-to-face with a fellow coach and letting the
cards and the dice decide our relative destiny. The Statis-Pro
basketball championship I won in 1993 is still a memory I cherish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((If you had more money, I would really urge that you join us
in John Caruso's baseball league, it really is truly the best one
I've ever heard of from my perspective of how I like to manage a team.
But I think John is still charging $40.  Still, he has two teams
that he's running from the league office, so he might let you in 
cheap or free if you ask nicely.  
See his E-Mail address up above.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the music front, I've mainly been listening to either the
classics or J-Pop. Still, I have never and will never play Dance Dance
Revolution. It seems beneath my dignity somehow to hop around on pad and
pretend I'm dancing.

PS I'm watching the NBA playoffs right now, and a question came to
mind - if the 3-point line had been in place in 1977, would Portland
have still won the title or would the 76ers have beaten them with
long-range shooting?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((My opinion would be that they still would.  You think Henry Bibby
and Doug Collins would have been that good at being three point
shooters?  As I recall, when the three point shot finally was
put in place in 1979 (?), Henry Bibby (a guy I followed as a fan)
only shot about 20% on three pointers.  He never was all that good 
at them, though in that first year he was about the only 76er
shooting them.  Maurice Cheeks was much better at it, but he
wasn't on the 1977 playoff team, right?
I'm still leaving the @ signs out of the E-Mail addresses,
replacing them with " of ''s, even though I think it doesn't
make much sense, I still have comments coming in.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Michael Hopcroft (Thu, 24 Apr 2003 12:36:05 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another thing to bear in mind on this question is that 77 Portland had
several former ABA players who were familiar with the 3-point rule. It
probably wouldn't have helped Maurice Lucas much (his offense was a
bone-crushing inside power game), but Dave Twardzik and Bobby Gross were
good outside shooters who could probably have made 35% or more of their
3-pointers.

An issue back, you mentioned people scanning the zine for addresses by 
picking up anything with an @ in the middle. I have a somewhat similar 
problem with my e-mail name, as advertisers send me assorted crap dumped on 
anyone with a "dr" in the name: they are looking for doctors!  Thus, it 
occurred to me that perhaps you should put an@sign instead of a space 
between random words throughout the zine, and let these yoyos send their 
junk mail to all sorts of nonexistent addresses.

The spam load hitting my work account went from almost none to several
every day in the weeks after you listed this claritas account on TAP.
I'm adding meta robots tags to all the DC-dot-org pages; and I'm checking
with my ISP on a robots.txt file since DC is a top-level domain.
Unfortunately, most spiders that ignore the standards for meta robots tags
and robots.txt are also the sell-to-spammer harvesters that are most likely
to figure out your "at" substitutions.
I read the commission report (with last year's test data) but I hadn't done
my own tests with different e-mail addresses... until you inadvertently did
it with my work account.  I don't know what we can do beyond the steps
above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((The ones they mostly get are the ones like "My.E-Mail@nospamyahoo.com"
Any yahoo can figure that one out.  When you take the @ out and replace it 
with another word entirely, like of, I think it's safe to say people will be safe.
BUT, you know that EVER having things on the Internet leaves an electronic trail
that can be traced, so you actually have to change your E-Mail address if
you really want to go back to being clean.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One other word on TAP:  boilerplate!  Run a comparison on how many words
are strung the same from issue to issue... with a lot of them also on the
TAP index page.  (Of course DC-dot-org is mostly holdover text/links but
it's a reference site, not a szine.)  You could cut your printing/postage
cost, I'll bet, just by trimming most of that to one-liners.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) We had some small errors in the adjudication last time.
Chris' move of a rum-UKR succeeds since Rick can't cut the
support of an attack on himself.  That means that Rick is 
dislodged and can retreat to Galicia or off the board.
And that means that Rick only has a removal if Ukr retreats to Gal.
And Chris actually has a build instead of being even.   
All players were notified and orders were submitted for those
powers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The GRAFT, the TIGER, and the RAFT all are cast out and rejected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I think Allan and Jim will be returning, at least I hope so, so I
will hesitate and not appoint standbies yet.  If I think I need standbies
because I haven't heard from them by mid-next week, I'll appoint them
and notify everyone by E-Mail.
If there are standbies, orders ALWAYS can be made conditional on who
is playing the position (i.e. whose orders I use).
My standby list is taking a big hit in the next game.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA): in light of the failure of leadership in Moscow, the reins of
power have been handed to the South Park kids, who did such a great
job with "Show Me the Money!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CARTMAN - &gt;  AUSTRIA): Screw you, hippie!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EXCERPT FROM "THE POWERS WHO HATE BLURBISTS, AND THE
BLURBISTS WHO LOVE THEM":

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Needy, demanding, insecure, the Blurbist desires more
than anything an ally who is communicative, an ally
who places the sharing of intimate thoughts and
feelings as an alliance's highest priority.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Does that include one's sexual fantasies....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At the same time, a Blurbist's innate fear of
commitment drives him to court allies who are the
least likely to provide this abundance of openness.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Is this one of the Blurbist's sexual fantasies???))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Frustrated by his own conflicting desires, the
Blurbist will lash out at those to whom one would most
expect him to reach out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Sounds like sex, but I'd better stop there
and let the Blurbist get on with it.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As a case study, we take the unfortunate example of
one Mr. B.V. Blurbist (names have been changed to
lessen lawyers fees). Constantly complaining to
friends and acquaintances of his inability to build an
open and communicative relationship, B.V. finds
himself by happenstance coming into contact with an
old ally with whom he has lost touch, Rich Desperate
(see the name thing above).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
B.V. and Rich enjoy a blossoming of intimacy, sharing
thoughts and feelings about those who have hurt them
in the past, including each other. These shared
intimacies lead to promises and vows of a touching
nature. Things seem hopeful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But just before a commitment is about to be made,
another ex-ally reappears in B.V.'s life. Known for
long stretches of heartless silences broken by
extravagant promises of communication, this ex-ally,
Tom Miller-Lite, steal's B.V.'s heart again with
tender apologies interspersed with plays of guilt upon
B.V.'s own past untoward behavior.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once again the sad pattern plays itself out. B.V.
places his trust in a questionable promise of
communication, while lashing out at the one person who
has readily provided it. Without the effort to
understand his behavior, B.V. is doomed to repeat it. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Will Rich help B.V. break the cycle? Will Tom finally
fulfill his wild promises? With that irresistibly
quiet Italian guy send B.V. a wink and throw his whole
life into chaos again? Only time and incessant
talk-show appearances will tell.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAN - &gt;  BOARD):  we generally think the Blurbist is a hoser

(All kids laugh).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAN - &gt;  SULTAN MILLER):  Dude, give us a buzz.  Alliance with Blurbist
will get you nowhere.  Don't you have any pride?  You need to take
Bulgaria.    Let's set up mutual supports in Moscow and Sev.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KYLE - &gt;  FOOL):  Good job defending Venice.  The Evil Blurbist 
will find it tougher to take anything now

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CARTMAN - &gt;  GM):  I propose a BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ draw.

(BOOB to CARTMAN): What happened to the A-Hole???

1) Jim Tretick was moving and very busy, so I'm not completely surprised that
he NMRed, and Jody was switching to a new Internet Service Provider, so perhaps
he is having connection problems.
In any case, I've appointed Dan Gorham and Phil Reynolds as standbies.  The
Winter orders are due on May 10th, I must have draft Spring orders from Jim
and Jody by then for them to keep their positions - even though Jody doesn't
have any Winter adjustments.  Other players may make their adjustments conditional
upon who is playing the various positions and submitting orders.

1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed
and I still didn't have a chance
to do the final Endgame chart.
You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and 
is guest GMing a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next "big" game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, could Harold give me an exact count
of how many are signed up?
Also, Harold ran a test game with Konrad Baumeister, Dave Partridge
and Paul Rauterberg
that you could look at on his website.
See the note above about the Diplomacy A to Z, which also is there.

1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Note that Karl Muller has a new address, he did notify me of that, see note
below.... but he still hasn't sent orders.
You guys can send Fall orders even if you didn't submit Spring ones!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY to AUSTRIA): Your nuke in Venice could still end up hurting you more than
it does me.          

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KARL MULLER): Several things I have to announce:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1. Peggy birthed our son, Brian Alexander Muller, at 6:47 p.m. yesterday (3/31).
He was a big one, weighing in at 9 lbs., 3 oz., and was 20 inches in length.
As last time, Peg did not have an epidural or anything like, though it was by 
her choice this time.  Mommy and baby are doing very well.  Katy met Brian for the
first time this afternoon, and she seems really enthusiastic about having a 
brother, wanting to know when it was her turn to feed him, change him, etc.  
We can only hope that continues.  Discharge will be tomorrow morning.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2. I have left my position here at Schloss &amp; Co., therefore, this address is no
longer valid.  See the next two points.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3. We are about to move, and our new address will be:
3154 East Lydius Street, Schenectady, NY 12303-5035.      
The more geographically-astute among you will realize this is nowhere near 
our current NYC  residence.  
<i>((The geographically astute among you ALSO will realize that I
grew up in Schenectady, but the other end of town a fair way - perhaps
ten miles - from Lydius Street.
Congratulations Karl and family, and now we are SURE that Karl won't
resume publishing his Diplomacy szine, but perhaps we might get a
few orders from him.
We'll see.))</i>
We are re-locating northward to the Albany, NY region; the house is 
actually in Guilderland, but the post office is in Schenectady.  We
expect to move by May 1.  There's no phone number yet, though you can certainly
e-mail us and we'll give it when we get it (see next point).  I've already got a
job (starting 5/5), and Peg is completing applications for teaching positions 
even as we speak in the hospital (hey, she's good).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4. Because we don't know if we can get high-speed access from Earthlink, 
we're not sure if we'll be keeping our current e-mail address.  
Therefore, effective immediately, please use the following 
to reach Peg or myself: karlmuller@alumni.lemoyne.edu.  
This is a forwarding address that will bounce it to whatever we 
eventually end up with.  
So don't just REPLY to this message; you'll have to edit the TO field.  
Yeah, what a pain.
Well, that's enough news for now, I suppose.  Best wishes to all...
- Karl

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper, Sean O'Donnell, Dave Partridge, Alexander Woo,
and Kurt Ozog are in to be five of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".
But we do need official wings rules, which I seem to be unable to locate.
Can anyone assist me there?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): Takes an issue off, gotta get this sucker
in the mail, don't have time to find one....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(NOTE TO BLACKFIRE): I just don't see how!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to KIEV):  Looks like you've finally got that coalition against 
you that you've been working so hard to achieve.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK to STARFLEET): Things aren't going well, all I can do is hold.
Even Spock is bored.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPAIN-BOARD): Which way did he go George which way did he go?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UKRAINE-JEFF): I'm going to get you my pretty and your little Nephew
too, by the way, my nephew beat up your honor student.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I respect Germany not going to Iraq with us.
I would also respect France not going except they seem to be
going beyond their right to free democratic resistance to the
Iraq mission.  
They seem to be actively helping the Iraq regime in ways that even
the UN would not approve.
And for that, I feel they are open to ridicule.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM to JEFF): Fair enough.
Consider yourself explained.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM PS): I'm not sure going to Iraq was a bright move,
but supporting Iraq???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY-UKRAINE): You want a piece of me?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to SEAN): Sometimes I read my Star Trek press and say to myself,
wow, my writing really sucks!
However, I must also say that all of that Star Trek black press that you have
been doing really sucks.
PS: Next time you black press a message from Turkey to Uncle Jeff, try doing it
from the Sultan to "oh mighty Pharoah".
Kent would never talk to me as an actual person.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UKRANIAN AMBASSADOR to TURKISH AMBASSADOR): Rest assured, ambassador, that we
have treated your country with the utmost respect and now rejoice at having
finally succeeded in driving the Egyptian dogs from your fair shores.  The war
goes on and your wishes will ride with us!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to WORLD): I really hate the Yankees!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT-UKRAINE): The Egyptian Emperor reborn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KENT POLLARD to UNCLE JEFF): I've decided to talk to you like an actual person,
ae you ready?
Your Star Trek press really sucks and so do you!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
