<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website incorporating all subszines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We will theoretically have four subszines going forward, from Dave Partridge, 
Doug Kent, Andy York, and 
Peter Sullivan.  But Dave Partridge is even farther behind than me
on finishing <i>Tinamou</i>, Andy York is working on 
By the WAY, but Peter is back active!  
Doug of course puts us all to shame otherwise.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire szine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

Creeping up on us like an old pair of Jim-Bob's underwear:  
<b>IT'S BASEBALL SEASON!!!!!!</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
From what I gather the weather for y'all is much like it is here:  
more suitable for football than baseball.  No matter.  
Let's just throw it hard and a little inside and watch the batters try 
to not hurt themselves making contact.  
In full disclosure I have to admit that I'm making my predictions this year 
under the influence of extra Dijon mustard on my ham &amp; swiss sandwich, 
but it was prescribed by a guy claiming to be Barry Bonds' former trainer.  
Why he's now making sandwiches in my company cafeteria is an exercise 
for the alert reader...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yeah, right, the breaking news this week, of course, is Barry's
conviction on Obstruction of Justice, but mistrial on what he actually 
might or might not have done.
This is highly likely to be thrown out on appeal, or they will have to
keep retrying this.
As I've long said in this space, to understand what other people interpret
as Barry's arrogance, you have to go back to the experience of his dad,
Bobby in the 1970's.
I find the whole thing very sad, and MOST emphatically think it is 
patently unfair for Barry to be a poster child for the Steroid era
in baseball.
Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) are part of the backdrop of professional
sports since the 1960's.
It is difficult if one wants to have a realistic "if you were there,
what would you do?" approach to deal with ideologues on this question.
I understand it, but I don't know how to talk to them about it.
I suppose the main point is that if I had a vote, I would vote for Barry
Bonds for the Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible and I similarly 
understand why many people will not.
There are still PEDs in the game (and I'm not talking about Manny), so
more needs to be done to get the rules and practice in line with what the
goals of the game are.  
I wish baseball HAD done that better and WAS doing it better, but it's not.
The inequities are what bother me.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It appears that this year, like most years, the best two teams are 
again in the AL East.  
You can all recite my rant from the last 15 years by rote.  
On with the show...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:  Rockies, Giants, Dodgers, Padres, Diamondbacks.  I see a drop off here
from last year, and this becomes only a 2-team race.  Colorado goes 88-74.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:  Goz small-market rule #2:  if a small-market team wins a division i
t drops at least to third the next year.  Cards, Cubs, Reds, Astros, Brewers, Pi
rates.  Only the Cards break .500, and they only get to 84-78.  Cubs go 81-81 an
d Reds go 80-82 to make it look like it's a race between competent teams, even t
hough it's not.  The Pirates bring in Sidney Crosby at the trade deadline so tha
t they can get more than 4000 people in the stands in August, even though he's o
nly brought in as a right-fielder in the 8th &amp; 9th innings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:  Not *quite* the beast it's been, or at least it's been thought of.  I
think that Philly should win, but it just seems like they're a little out of wha
ck.  So I'll go Braves, Phillies (WC), Marlins, Nats, Mets.  There is a new laug
hingstock in the league.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:  As with Philadelphia, something just seems wrong about Texas.  While I
 don't like the prospect of any of the other teams, I'll still say Angels, A's,
Rangers, Mariners.  Angels go 87-75.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Al Central:  I don't believe that Gardenhire is a better manager than Ozzie, so
either the Twins have been incredibly lucky the last couple of years or their GM
 is a genius (Kenny Williams of the White Sox isn't) or both.  I'm betting their
 luck runs out this year:  White Sox, Twins, Indians, Tigers, Royals.  The Tiger
s might finish last.  They really don't seem right.  Ozzie gets the Sox to 89-73
, 2 games ahead of Minnesota.  Cleveland wins 76 games and the fan base feels go
od about it after the year they've had.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:  I think the Red Sox are so good they may actually get overconfident.
Red Sox, Yankees (WC), Rays, Blue Jays, Orioles.  Anyone found picking Baltimore
 for a playoff spot will be forced to watch the 20-hour mini-series:  &#203;arl Weav
er Manages in Spring Training" and be drug tested.  Red Sox win 104 games, Yanke
es win 99.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Playoffs:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLDS:  Rockies over Phillies 3-2, Braves over Cards 3-1.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALDS:  Yankees over White Sox 3-1, Red Sox over Angels 3-1.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NLCS:  Braves over Rockies 4-1.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS:  Yankees over Red Sox 4-3.  Boston fans riot and burn down Fenway, which o
nly adds to its charm.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Braves over Yankees 4-2.  The Yankee organization somehow tries to spin it
locally that they really were winners this year.  2 months later it will be foun
d that Bobby Cox actually was making all the in-game decisions for Atlanta and s
ending them via text message.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All right gents, there's your jump-start for the year.  Someone wake up Jim-Bob
and get your own picks in.

Jim-Bob,
According to a report on ESPN.com the 1919 Chicago White Sox got the idea
to throw that year's World Series from the Cubs, who lost the 1918 World Series
to the Red Sox 4-2.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I realize that you were only the Director of Player Development at the
time, but did you think there was anything funny going on during that World
Series?

<i>((Absolutely, this is further evidence that the Cubs curse is entirely of
their OWN making.  The Red Sox won that one of course and then defeated
their own curse for participating by juicing up Manny and Papi.  You
Chicagoans need to learn how to cheat to win better.))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Thursday,  April 21, 2011 9:45 AM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So you're saying we need more than just Sosa shooting up both his body and
his bat.  Wood and Pryor would have been good candidates in 1997 or so, but it's
obviously too late now.  The Cubs have a bunch of good, young talent that just
needs to mature physically and emotionally to contend for the next 6 or 8 years.
It might be good to start them on the sauce mid-this year to get them pointed
in the right direction.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((No, no, no, the idea is  that the Cubs are "bad cheaters", they cheat to
lose.  The Red Sox cheat to win.  That's the difference.  I know Sosa was
in that group.  If you do it again, you'll just lose again.  I'm not sure
what is the "cleansing" way out.  You may be doomed to lose forever,
though forever is a long time.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Thu, Apr 21, 2011 at 10:52 AM)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So if cheating won't work we'll have to figure another angle.  
Still, there's lots of possibilities.  The Cubs could go so clean 
they'd squeak, and become a role model for kids nationwide.  
They'd get immortalized in Norman Rockwell paintings.  
Or they could all cop an attitude and sell lots of "bad boy" posters.  
Pluses and minuses for both.  I'll check with marketing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
a) Dusty Baker killed the arms of Mark Prior and Kerry Wood.  Better management
would have built a World Series run around those two.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
b) While Manny's late career PED usage is well documented, I'm not convinced he
was using while with the Sox.  At least not during the World Series years.  MLB
actually has had good testing procedures in place in 2003.  It's plausible in my
mind that he started using PEDs late in his career to fight the natural decline
(the same pattern is evident in Barry Bonds' career).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for Ortiz, there's really no credible evidence that he <i>did</i> use PEDs, other
than an anonymous leak claiming that his name was on a list.  There's no actual
test to point to.  Since he's tested clean for 8 years, I'd give him the benefit
of the doubt that there may have been a false positive.  I think that, before we
convict the guy, we ought to have at least a minimal standard of evidence.
Anonymous hearsay is pretty flimsy.

<i>((Hi Rick, you are correct of course.  I really was intentionally using
hyperbole to make the point about how up the creek the Cubs were in
outlandish terms.  My actual REAL position on PEDs actually mirrors the
much maligned Bud Selig's statement this week.  The records of what is are
what is.  Barry Bonds IS the MLB recordholder both single season and
career.  Whatever the testing model is and whatever it catches under the
rules are the rules.  I do not believe any testing model captures everyone
using PEDs, I do not even believe that the dividing line between PED and
legal nutritional supplement is clear.  I salute and invite baseball to
get better at the testing model, but it never will be perfect and that
won't stop me from enjoying baseball.
I also don't believe in curses, but they're fun to talk about.))</i>

Greetings, Jim.  (No, I don't use "Dear So-and-So" on either business
or personal letters, so when this opening is attributed to me, it's a
sign that the editor has changed the content I produced and OMG
VIOLATED MY COPYRIGHT, you'll be hearing from my legal team ...)  The
way you interspersed almost-unrelated comments through my music
article was fine for us, but made it so confusing that it was almost a
waste to send my musician friends a link to <i>TAP</i> 325.  Even the szine's
longtime readers couldn't be expected to grasp the piece's
organization and development.  Of course that's my fault, as I made
you transcribe a bunch of pages from hardcopy.  I should be happy
there are so few omissions and typos.  If I hoped to use these music
articles to get a real writing assignment, I'd be up the creek anyway.

This has already been the best first quarter I've ever had for live

been my best winter for snowshoeing.  I'm adding mountain biking and
(probably) kayaking to my activities, mainly for recreation with
fitness as a side-effect.  Who says I have to grow old gracefully?
Casual local gaming has also been strong, but it's been two years
since I attended any conventions either for Diplomacy tournaments or
for general strategy gaming.  Maybe I'll fit some cons in between
music festivals.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note that Mike Barno's postal address has changed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I think it is really cool that the press has taken off.
Please, please keep it up. 
Sorry for the delay, I did want (and get) orders from all of you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LITTLE BURGESS): I hope Phil is looking down on us and smiling... I 
played in a game with him at World Dipcon in Baltimore in the early 90s.
He was a really nice guy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(OLDER BURGESS to LITTLE BURGESS): That was 2000, you weren't at
the 1995 DipCon that Phil also was at, unless you were going 
pseudonymously!!!
That you are about the nice guy part, though, that was the only time (2000)
that I think I met him, since I wasn't at the 1995 DipCon either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILLIAMS to RIP VAN BURGESS):  So help me, Boob, don’t screw this up again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RIP to DUCK): If I recall correctly, you WERE at the 1995 DipCon.
I screw nothing up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to DAVID):  I made a pledge to you a long time ago about... 
well, something... I don’t exactly remember any more.  
Just know that I now intend to keep it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to FRANCE):  You were right, you know, Don.  If you had
bothered to write once in the real-time year I've been in this game,
you might have gotten my alliance.  I was again open to persuasion
this turn, when Austria-Hungary gave up the entire midboard for a lame
hope of getting Marseilles if the West failed to organize a defense.
If you had written half as much substantial negotiation as you wrote
fluffpress, you might have changed the game's flow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS - MOSCOW): Your email was correct and on point.  
So where do we all go from there?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MRS. POTTS to THE BEAST): I'm a little teapot short and stout, here is my
handle, here is my spout!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(F to I):  Honest, Crow, it usually is more fun than this,  Really. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SMOKEY THE BEAR to ITALY - It's time to "stop, drop and roll".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS to LONDON, BERLIN, ROME): Once more into the breach for God, Country and King.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to E/F/G/I):  And the rest of you worked as hard to get my
cooperation as if you were all Fred Wiedermeyer.  I guess Dave has a
Russian ally until stalemate forces a big draw.  At least I can give
you credit for finally getting your strategic act together.  One more
turn of fiddling and you would have been in a desperate scramble.

1) The FGR draw proposal is rejected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Hi all, as most of you know, Buddy's been having a tough time medically, but
he really wants to stay in the game, so I'd like to try to help him.
If you need to call Buddy about the game, mid-afternoon seems to be the best time. 
I did have a good discussion with him while talking about this build.
He doesn't seem to be getting to E-Mail very much.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Despite sending notes to John Biehl's new E-mail address, I have not 
received a removal and must NMR him, removing the unit farthest from his
home centers.
I am calling Vince Lutterbie as a standby.
See his contact information above.
Please welcome him to the game and let's continue!
He has verified to me he will be playing.

1) Now, we would like to see some endgame statements if we could, I've
printed the full game SC chart and would like to print the endgame statements
in the next issue.
I think Bruce also is going to say that he is retiring from Diplomacy
with this game (I hope he doesn't).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) This was a bit of a troubled game, one player passed away during the game,
another did very soon after he was eliminated.  I would hope, though, that we
could get some comments, especially from Roland who lasted all the way through!

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I think it remains WAY cool that Death and Yorick are paired at the back of 
the pack.  Ah, we knew them well.
The finish is approaching, can Death and Yorick get over the second sprint line
before the race is over?  
It will be close.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROM SOME UNNAMED PLACE IN THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM): Lord Vetinari steps out 
from behind a curtain and gestures to Dibbler, who scrambles away into the shadows, 
pushing his sausage cart.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Vetinari greets the assembled crowd at the finish line.
"I see that the Captain of the City Watch is leading the pack.  
Carrot is a good man who has always come through for the City of Ankh-Morpork.  
And behind him I see the Crone, old Granny Weatherwax on her broom.  
Not surprised to see her doing so well - that woman continues to amaze."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The riders of Discworld have claimed the top two places in the race.  I expect our representative from the Wizards' Guild shall also make an appearance anon."

"We'll hold a feast at the Patrician's Palace.  All finishers are invited!  
Death himself has been known to party festively at times like this!"

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b>
As I write this, all is right on the Boston sports scene, the Bruins have won two
straight overtime games, the Celtics are the FIRST team to advance to Round 2
of the NBA playoffs with a sweep of the hapless Knicks, and the Red Sox have
clawed back to within one game of .500 and are only a handful of games behind
the Yankees, with the continued resurgence of all the pitching, today it was
John Lackey with the Dan Wheeler assisted shutout.
It also is Easter, I hope all of you who celebrated it had a great one.
