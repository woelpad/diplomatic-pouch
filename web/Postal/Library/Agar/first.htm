<h1 align="CENTER">YOUR FIRST GAME OF POSTAL DIPLOMACY</h1>
<h2 align="CENTER">by Stephen Agar</h2>

<p><b>The First Letter</b></p>
<p>Having got your first gamestart, the question arises what you should do with
it.  Some players have a tendency to do nothing and just sit back and wait for
other players to write to them, though if all seven players display that sort of
attitude the game may take a long time to liven up.  Whenever you receive a
gamestart you should write to all the other players as soon as possible, even if
there is no possibility of any initial contact.  Yes, Germany should write to
Turkey in Spring 1901.</p>
<p>There are one or two things that it is best to avoid in a Diplomacy letter. 
First, it is common for people new to the hobby to start their letters something
like "Dear Monsieur Le President etc." - there is nothing wrong with
that, but to many players that sort of style will seem too fanciful and even
childish.  It is better not to pretend that you are a grand head of state but to
treat your opponents as players in a board game.</p>
<p>Second, avoid writing very short letters, especially at the beginning of a
game.  Such a letter will seem cold and impersonal. A good rule is never to send
off a letter which you would not like to receive yourself.  Diplomacy is very
much a game concerning the inter-relationships between individuals and you will
find that the other players will relate to you better if they see you as a
person.  I always include a potted biography in a first letter in the hope that
it will encourage the other players to do likewise.  Try and keep lines of
communication open to all the other players, even if they have stabbed you. 
There is no point bearing grudges if you want to do well.  It should be noted
that there are some players who try and play Diplomacy without contacting anyone
unless they are forced to.  These people are normally quickly eliminated, but
they can cause real consternation among their neighbours.</p>
<p>Given that a postal game will have 3/4 week deadlines that is ample time for
a bit of skulduggery.  If you are playing Germany there is nothing to stop
England photocopying one of your letters and passing a copy on to France as
evidence of your evil intent.  This should be borne in mind at all times.  It is
possible to prepare the ground for this by casually mentioning in your letter to
France that you will of course be writing to England proposing an alliance in
order to lull England into a false sense of security.  Even so, it is a good
idea not to go over the top in Diplomacy letters - never be insulting about the
other players, as you cannot guarantee that they won't get to see your letter in
the end.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Get Organised</b></p>
<p>There is a habit by which Diplomacy letters are headed by the Game Number or
Name, which country is writing to which (Eg. Germany-Italy), the game season and
year and the real date.  This enables the recipient of the letter to fix his
mind on the game that you are talking about before he/she starts reading the
letter.  It also helps you when it comes to keeping a record of your
correspondence.  Remember that your memory may not be as good as you think it
is.  Whenever possible try to keep copies of the letters you send out (you could
even use archaic carbon paper).  Imagine the confusion if you wrote to your ally
suggesting an ingenious yet complex set of moves, only to find that he/she
replied "OK, I agree".  Would you be able to remember exactly what you
had proposed? In any event, if you are going to lie to people, it is helpful to
have a record of the lies you have written and to whom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Telephones</b></p>
<p>The telephone is of course a quick and efficient method of communication. 
However, it does have some drawbacks (quite apart from the obvious one of cost).
 You may give too much away on the telephone, it is easy to get carried away and
it is not always easy to remember exactly what was said.  Certainly it is better
to make complex proposals, backed up by logical argument, by letter, as this
allows the other players to re-read your suggestions while looking at the
Diplomacy board and make a considered judgment.  It is easy to agree to
something on the telephone, only to appreciate the drawbacks on reflection. On
the other hand, the telephone is instantaneous and there is nothing for the
other player to photocopy and pass on (assuming that you call is not being
recorded!).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Publishers</b></p>
<p>A few words about zines and editors.  Do not expect too much.  An average
Diplomacy zine will take 30-40 hours of effort to put together, much of it over
a single weekend.  It is not just a matter of adjudicating games and typing game
reports.  There is filing, subscription management, stuffing envelopes, typing
and/or writing any additional material plus the knowledge that you will lose
money on every issue.  Editors publish zines partly as an ego-trip, but mainly
as a service.  This is a good natured amateur affair, not a commercial
enterprise.  If it is your first game, a delay of even a week in receiving your
game report may seem serious.  It is not.  Stay calm.  That is not to say that
you should put up with constantly shoddy service - if you have serious
objections to the way a zine is being run then you could ask another editor to
take on your game provided all other players agree.  Do not expect to enjoy 100%
of what is printed in a zine.  Some people are only interested in their game
reports. Others like articles, hobby news or just a lively letters page
discussing issues of the day.  Live and let live and I guarantee you will get
more out of the hobby in the end.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Dropping Out</b></p>
<p>If you dropout you will lose your deposit, outstanding credit and be
blacklisted from this and many other zines.  Do not do it.</p>
