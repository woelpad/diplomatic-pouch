Postal Diplomacy </h1>

<p>This part of the Pouch is to remind everyone out there that there are more
ways to play Diplomacy than just online. Postal Diplomacy is almost as old as
Diplomacy itself, originating in the US in 1963 and spreading to the UK by 1969,
Since then there are few countries in which the game has been sold which have
not at one time or another had a successful postal Diplomacy hobby.</p>

<p>With the coming of the Internet, there has been a decline in the number of
players playing postally, though many Internet players (who regard the 3-4 week
deadlines of the postal zines as too slow) choose to subscribe to some postal
Diplomacy zines as a way to supplement their online hobby rather than to replace
it. There's something about getting a proper physical zine, the product of an
enthusiastic Diplomacy fan, with letters from fellow hobbyists, articles on
aspects of Diplomacy, rules to Diplomacy variants and reports of games in
progress which is more real and immediate than browsing a web page. So why not
give it a go? Most zine editors will send off a sample copy to anyone who asks -
I think you will be surprised to find that the postal hobby can still reach the
parts that email has not discovered.</p>

<p>The purpose of these few pages is simple - to enable everyone to be able to
sample the best that the postal Diplomacy hobby has to offer. Enjoy.</p>
