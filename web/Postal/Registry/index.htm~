<b>Making Love in a Canoe</b>
</p>
<p> <a href="mailto:bmckee@the.link.ca">Brent McKee</a>, 901 Av T North, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan CANADA S7L 3B9
<p>“Ordinarily, I’d say something about Making Love In A Canoe being one of
the last — if not the last — zine that is mainly about one person publishing
for the joy of publishing, exchanging ideas with old friends in their
publication for the sake of exchanging ideas etc. The term once used is a
“reading zine”, with in Brent’s case the focus being on Canadian politics
and Canadian naval history. These are not ordinary times, however. There simply
has been rather less of MALOC to read lately. Like most such zines, Brent’s
publication never has been a turnaround king, but it did have a certain schedule
to it. Until recently. With only two issue out in the past eight months, MALOC
has slowed noticeably. While part of this is because of real life issues, part
is, as Brent describes it as being “ just (being) physically tired” and the
appeal of other free time activities (computer games, the internet etc.). This
is not, to my mind, a good sign at all. It is, I fear, the first signs of
burnout. As someone who published a very similar 20 page digest for several
years, I can certainly relate to the demands of the task. Right sizing a zine to
your time and energy level is something that is critical to the long term
survival of any even medium-sized publication and is something Brent should
consider.” MPL</p>

<p>“It’s not particularly pretty but I try to make it easy to play in by
including maps and player addresses in every issue. In defiance of all
predictions, NF V2 has been growing in size, circulation and number of games
running — even after accounting for the orphaned games I’ve picked up.” RL</p>
<p>“Robert puts out a nice, bimonthly, digest zine. Though hardly handsome
(Robert does not like computers — I believe one bit him as a child) NF V2 is
still a very worthwhile publication, with the standard Dip zine features
including Diplomacy and Gunboat games, and a letter column. More unusual
features for a Dip zine include a column on classical music and discussions of
wargaming magazines. Definitely a throwback, though a good one.” MPL</p>

<p>A five weekly, eight to ten open page zine first published in 1990 with a
circulation of 35. Price: $1/issue (more in the U.S.) Games running: Diplomacy,
Gunboat, Mitotic Diplomacy Game openings: Diplomacy, Gunboat, Mitotic Diplomacy</p>
<p>“TTA is the best Canadian zine to play in. It’s the most regular, with
the best GM’ing, the players are all there to play, so the NMR’s are very
low. The deadlines are very closely followed, but not with ‘strictness’. The
editorials are left leaning, social-democratic, environmentally friendly. The
letter column has had some good disagreements about economics in the past, but
there is no ‘trashing’ allowed in the zine. The author is crazy about riding
motorcycles and enjoys telling about his journeys.” EY</p>
<p>“I think I have been subscribing to TTA ever since it started —what,
about 10 years ago? It hasn’t changed much since then. Eric usually runs a
handful of games with clear, third-page maps. Sometimes he runs uncommon
variants like Mitotic Diplomacy. TTA players tend to be veteran hobby types, and
many of them —more so than in any other zine, I would bet — are Canadian.
Eric revels in his zine’s Canadian flavor, though he doesn’t hide his
passion for the American NFL! Other features include brain teasers and the
occasional letter column. This zine may not be fancy, but it’s dependable.”
PR</p>
<p>“By the time this is published, this zine will be on hiatus until late
August. While I can’t predict if Eric will decide he can live without
publishing, my bet would be that he returns to business as usual. It’s been
said many times that TTA is the best zine to play in published in Canada. His
deadlines are his bond and he successfully forecasts them well in advance. He
encourages press and his players respond enthusiastically.” RL</p>

kind of thing, but then it’s been said that a sense of humour transplant may
lead to happier days, so we’ll wait around for that. Nic Chilton also makes an effort to set himself up as some

<p class="MsoNormal">This is generally my favourite zine at the moment because
of the range of games run both by Clive himself and by the 4 subzine editors.
Clive runs several games himself, although he since reaching issue 100 he has
restricted himself to GM non-intensive games. Amongst them is Mississippi Queen
(which is fun).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subzines,
however, do run more intensive games, including 18xx, Civilisation and a Cthulu-based
En-Garde. In gaming terms, something for everyone. Unfortunately, a couple of the subzines have been erratic
recently, but none the less this still picked my No. 1 vote in the recent zine
poll. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(Philip

<p class="MsoNormal">This latest issue of <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Pigbutton</b>
is a particularly slim affair, with only two of the three in-house subzines
appearing this time round and absolutely nothing from the editor himself. I’d
be very hard-pushed to recommend this on the substance of this issue alone, but
Clive’s zine is recognised as an excellent and reliable place to play all
manner and variety of postal games which are somewhat different to de rigueur. Issue #116 is definitely not worth the asking price,
however, and recent issues have also been pretty lacklustre, so here’s looking
to better days ahead... If you’re writing off for a sample issue, ask for a
copy of #113, ’cos that was the last decent issue I can recall. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(Alex

is so overlooked; perhaps the import of young blood in the form of Nick Parish
will raise its profile, although the last 2 zines which had Nick as a subzine
editor both went belly-up this year! There's usually a couple of
pages of chat each issue from John Webley, normally restricted to his personal
interests (bird-watching, holidays and board games) whilst Messrs. Challinger
and Creese have a wider remit, pontificating on anything from contraception to
the immaculate conception.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's

  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">You play in one of Jim's
  games,. you better come prepared to write some Press! You know when you walk
  into a pub at about half past ten and everyone is talking nineteen to the

  like - the atmosphere crackles and at first it seems like everyone is talking
  bollocks (look, Tony Dickinson seems one of the more coherent correspondents)

  sports, like invading foreign countries, and you begin to get a handle on it

<p>I have received TAP off and on for several years. Jim is one of the best GMs
I have played for. His errors in adjudication, if any, are few and far between
— a rare thing these days. Jim runs his games on a schedule unlike that of any
other GM: He always separates seasons for retreats and adjustments, even when
there are no retreats or adjustments to be made. Although this is how Diplomacy
games are played face-to-face, and it requires no predictions on players’
parts, the downside is that games in TAP take one-and-a-half to two times longer
to play than in traditional monthly zines. But this isn’t so bad if you are
planning on being in the hobby for a few years! Half-page maps are good. Lively
press, with frequent interjections from Jim, are even better. Many hobby
veterans, who you won’t find anywhere else, play here. Besides the occasional
political chat, TAP is best known for its sprawling forum on music, ranging from
rock to classical. Much of this goes over my head, since I’m still wedded to
’70s rock, but I glean some useful information from the banter every now and
then. This zine also features “Tinamou”, a promising subzine by the Snowball
Fighting - and variant-loving David Partridge. Michael Lowrey's Houdini Blues also features Diplomacy and Outpost openings.  TAP is a great source for hobby
news. I consider it to be the flagship zine of our hobby.” PR</p>
<p>“A big one for sure, TAP is one the most interesting reads and best overall
zines I see. While the layout is rather basic, the content is what drives TAP: a
large letter column centered on the Diplomacy hobby (Jim sponsors contests to
find long lost PBM Dippers…) and music of all sorts. (Unlike Phil, most of it
doesn’t go over my head, but then I’m also a volunteer DJ at a public radio
station that plays a little bit of everything.) The letter column typically runs
several pages, though as with Maniac’s Paradise in its time, attempts are not
really made to minimize the total size, taking the content as a given, of the
zine. In addition to the zine proper, there are no lack of subzines, with
notable efforts coming from David Partridge, Michael Lowrey, and Don Williams.
The games, meanwhile, are well run and between Jim and his subzine editors,
there is a wide selection on offer. Recommended and a bargain at only $1.50 an
issue.” MPL</p>

that Conrad has a tendency to sit at his keyboard and spin out depressive tomes
on the state of the hobby and other such matters from one who really has lived
through all of the hobby’s diverse stages. I’m actually kinda excited about
the hobby at the moment, so Conrad’s “end of an era” comments hit me
sideways, but if you can get past that, he still runs great games! He’s almost
too careful as a GM to try to deal with all protests as fairly as humanly
possible. As in his recent game “The Fist”, this went on a bit too far and
though (in my humble opinion) he made the correct remedy, perhaps he could have
made it quicker. I find that profuse apologies and quick corrections usually are
best. This is the only place you will find such all round great guy dippers as
Bart Denny, he has funny and unique puzzles, and hey, just relaxing on the couch

changed a single bit! I, of course, looked much older; (2) A great mix of hobby
old farts like Barno, up and coming pure postal players like Rick Copeland, and
a heavy representation of the brand new players who don’t seem to be playing
elsewhere; and (3) a very sensitive letter column that mixes the personal with
the hobby in just the right mixture. Phil has his detractors because illness and
other real life matters have forced him to be less than regular with his szine
products, but he seems to be going full steam right now! Like many reformed
delay plagued pubbers, he’s even a bit of a turbophreak now, meant in the good
way! Check out this little szine that seems to be growing into a hobby stalwart
in an age where it feels real lonely out here!” JB</p>
<p>“While Jim is obviously very optimistic about ishkibibble, I am only
willing to go along with about three quarters as far. There is no doubt that
Phil puts out a nice publication that has, despite some real life problems,
become one of the better publications out there. Yet ishkibibble is really still
a semi-warehouse, with probably 80 percent of the space in zine going to the
games with a few movie reviews, some hobby news (which often features my name,
so he’s obviously doing something right), and a little bit of hobby chat
thrown in. Phil is one of the better writers in the hobby; seeing more of these
talents on display and the emergence of a real letter column would eliminate
(along with access to a better printer) some of that warehouse feel and promote
Phil’s publication from the mere very good to the top echelon of Dip
publications.” MPL</p>

<p>A six weekly, 24 digest page zine first published in October 1992 with a
circulation of 50. Price: $1/issue, $1.50 overseas Games running: Diplomacy,
Downfall, Fog-of-War Diplomacy, Golden Strider, RoboRally Sea of Despair Game
openings: Diplomacy, RoboRally, Banquette of Borgia</p>
<p>“Let’s see... off-the-shelf, what can I say? We try to maintain a
friendly little zine whilst ignoring the occasional black-press-inspired abuse.
This is a quiet little neighborhood, currently; none of the games feature
poetry, despite the presence of all the usual suspects. Game maps are in color,
as is the occasional cover. Beyond that, this despondent saith not; judge the
zine by what the reader-reviewers write...” TH</p>
<p>“One of the sturdy zines of yore. Tom has a lively letter column, good
writing on whatever is going on in his life at the time, and a good
cross-section of games. He always has an all player game which gets some of the
less active players to contribute. This zine is probably my most read zine as I
bring it to work with me to peruse in my spare time. Press in games is very
strong as well. There are some NMR problems (myself included!) but not terribly
bad. Tom adjudicates games well and even reminds players through email when the
deadline is nearing. This is the place to be if you want a sense of
community.” WN</p>
<p>““It’s not just a bunch of tree-hugging hippy crap”. This
caffeine-free zine comes from the wilds of Washington state, but has managed to
go into color recently, and runs a mix of Dip, Downfall, Sea of Despair and a
previously-orphaned RoboRally game. There is a map quiz, and a commentary on
Tom’s recent expeditions into the Olympic Ranges, his dance classes, or
building his new house in what must be close to paradise... A fine zine, small
but chummy, and great to curl up with in front of the tent, under a starry sky,
and to digest along with the lentils. It’s back to earth Dip. Get it now,
before the rain forests disappear.” BW</p>
<p>“Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair. Fuzzy Wuzzy did have
taste in his Dip zines though, which is why Fuzzy Wuzzy subbed to ots. That, and
Fuzzy Wuzzy needed a map to get home, and Tom’s zine is a great source for
such maps.” MPL</p>

<p>An irregular, 16ish open page zine first published in August 1982 with a
circulation of 50. Price: $.55/issue Games running: Diplomacy, Gunboat,
Philadelphia Dip Games openings: Diplomacy, Gunboat, Philadelphia Dip, Balkan
Wars VI, Fictionary Dictionary</p>
<p>“Tottering into the new millennium, Vertigo continues to provide a place to
play casual Diplomacy and variants, discuss music, gaming, and politics, and
feature my oddball play lists, feature articles and Ted “Swizzle” Stick on
drinking. Plenty of decrepit dinosaurs of the hobby still graze here but new
blood is welcome and I need new players. All welcome. Even Stan Johnson!” BW</p>
<p>“Declared dead in these pages several times over the last few years,
Vertigo and it’s less talky alter ego MGJ still live! True, the deadlines tend
to be 1/4 to 1/3 of the turn around time, but think of it as possibly the best
deal in Dipdom — a ten issue subscription could last two or three years! The
caliber of play is still quite high, so having the sitzfleish and skill to win a
game is an accomplishment.” PB</p>
<p>“When it is published, Vertigo is one of my favorite zines, and it always
has been so. Brad has the best letter column in the hobby regarding politics and
current events. Vertigo is a great source for hobby news and opinions —
Brad’s and others’ — on hobby matters. There’s also a good dose of
sports chat (not surprising given Brad is a sports journalist!). In the
meantime, those of us playing in Brad’s games get Meet George Jetson, his
warehouse effort for Diplomacy, variants and games like Fictionary Dictionary.
Many hobby old-timers play here. The press is great, and Brad doesn’t hesitate
to chip in his own chiding press. It’s great being one of the gang here.” PR</p>
<p>“There are a few things that have been a constant in this hobby for the ten
plus years that I’ve been in it. Vertigo/Meet George Jetson is one of them.
Never really on time, Brad manages to put out an interesting product which is
heavy on the chat, hobby news, and sports and music. And, as Paul and Phil have
said, it is a major bargain and, in general, a kind of cool place to hang out.
Get this because you want to play games at a somewhat erratic pace in a zine
with this certain feel to it and find what Brad has to say interesting. If,
however, speed of turnaround, top rate GMing, and overall look are your key
factors in selecting a zine, you should look elsewhere.” MPL</p>

<p>A six weekly, ten open page zine first published in April 1995 with a
circulation of 42. Price: $.50/issue Games running: Diplomacy, Gunboat Game
openings: Diplomacy, Gunboat (no game fees)</p>
<p>“Yellow Pajamas is basically a warehouse zine. It is for people who like to
play.” PM</p>
<p>“Whilst this is a warehouse zine, that doesn’t mean we never get reading
material. Sometimes the reading material is strictly limited to the press in the
games. Other times we are treated to several pages of Paul on diverse subjects.
YP features a detailed analysis of each turn for every game. Just the thing for
our novice players, and I also recommend them to the experienced player. For
those who care, it looks pretty, too.” TH</p>
<p>“This strikes me as probably the ideal place for a newcomer’s first game.
With each adjudication Paul includes an explanation about why certain moves
failed, etc. Old pros will skip this but it will be valuable to a novice.” RL</p>
<p>“The one thing that sets Yellow Pajamas apart from other zines is Paul’s
commentaries on each game’s adjudication. I don’t think I have ever seen
this done before. This should be very helpful for new players or those who
otherwise might not understand why what just happened, happened. His players
tend to be hobby institutions who have been around forever. This makes for
highly competitive play and entertaining press. Paul also gives his thoughts on
hobby events, like GMs orphaning games without any consideration for the players
involved. And he usually provides a dose of news from the home or work fronts
for a personal touch. Yellow Pajamas has shown itself to be a dependable, albeit
modest, zine for playing Diplomacy.” PR</p>
<p>“Yellow Pajamas is basically just a Diplomacy warehouse zine with a bit
house rules/play-of-the-game discussion thrown in. It’s another of those
dependable games zines — publications that aim to be little more than a good
place to play a game — that forms the backbone of this hobby.” MPL</p>
