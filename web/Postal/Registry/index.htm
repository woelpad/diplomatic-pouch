<p>“It’s not particularly pretty but I try to make it easy to play in by
including maps and player addresses in every issue. In defiance of all
predictions, NF V2 has been growing in size, circulation and number of games
running — even after accounting for the orphaned games I’ve picked up.” RL</p>
<p>“Robert puts out a nice, bimonthly, digest zine. Though hardly handsome
(Robert does not like computers — I believe one bit him as a child) NF V2 is
still a very worthwhile publication, with the standard Dip zine features
including Diplomacy and Gunboat games, and a letter column. More unusual
features for a Dip zine include a column on classical music and discussions of
wargaming magazines. Definitely a throwback, though a good one.” MPL</p>

<p>“TTA is the best Canadian zine to play in. It’s the most regular, with
the best GM’ing, the players are all there to play, so the NMR’s are very
low. The deadlines are very closely followed, but not with ‘strictness’. The
editorials are left leaning, social-democratic, environmentally friendly. The
letter column has had some good disagreements about economics in the past, but
there is no ‘trashing’ allowed in the zine. The author is crazy about riding
motorcycles and enjoys telling about his journeys.” EY</p>
<p>“I think I have been subscribing to TTA ever since it started —what,
about 10 years ago? It hasn’t changed much since then. Eric usually runs a
handful of games with clear, third-page maps. Sometimes he runs uncommon
variants like Mitotic Diplomacy. TTA players tend to be veteran hobby types, and
many of them —more so than in any other zine, I would bet — are Canadian.
Eric revels in his zine’s Canadian flavor, though he doesn’t hide his
passion for the American NFL! Other features include brain teasers and the
occasional letter column. This zine may not be fancy, but it’s dependable.”
PR</p>
<p>“By the time this is published, this zine will be on hiatus until late
August. While I can’t predict if Eric will decide he can live without
publishing, my bet would be that he returns to business as usual. It’s been
said many times that TTA is the best zine to play in published in Canada. His
deadlines are his bond and he successfully forecasts them well in advance. He
encourages press and his players respond enthusiastically.” RL</p>

Babylon 5, and of course Blackadder itself. Personally it wasn’t exactly my
kind of thing, but then it’s been said that a sense of humour transplant may
lead to happier days, so we’ll wait around for that. Nic Chilton also makes an effort to set himself up as some

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">A5 booklet, 5 - 6 weekly, 24
pages, 75p including postage</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is generally my favourite zine at the moment because
of the range of games run both by Clive himself and by the 4 subzine editors.
Clive runs several games himself, although he since reaching issue 100 he has
restricted himself to GM non-intensive games. Amongst them is Mississippi Queen
(which is fun).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subzines,
however, do run more intensive games, including 18xx, Civilisation and a Cthulu-based
En-Garde. In gaming terms, something for everyone. Unfortunately, a couple of the subzines have been erratic
recently, but none the less this still picked my No. 1 vote in the recent zine
poll. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(Philip
Honeybone)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This latest issue of <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Pigbutton</b>
is a particularly slim affair, with only two of the three in-house subzines
appearing this time round and absolutely nothing from the editor himself. I’d
be very hard-pushed to recommend this on the substance of this issue alone, but
Clive’s zine is recognised as an excellent and reliable place to play all
manner and variety of postal games which are somewhat different to de rigueur. Issue #116 is definitely not worth the asking price,
however, and recent issues have also been pretty lacklustre, so here’s looking
to better days ahead... If you’re writing off for a sample issue, ask for a
copy of #113, ’cos that was the last decent issue I can recall. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(Alex

(tax deductible I expect)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Somewhat of a rest home for
grand old men of the hobby, with John Webley (former winner of the SubZine
Poll), Geoff Challinger (former winner of the Zine Poll) and Brian Creese
(co-editor of the best zine never to have won the Zine Poll) on the team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With an heavyweight line-up like that it is hard to fathom why this zine
is so overlooked; perhaps the import of young blood in the form of Nick Parish
will raise its profile, although the last 2 zines which had Nick as a subzine
editor both went belly-up this year! There's usually a couple of
pages of chat each issue from John Webley, normally restricted to his personal
interests (bird-watching, holidays and board games) whilst Messrs. Challinger
and Creese have a wider remit, pontificating on anything from contraception to
the immaculate conception.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's
even the first rumblings of a letter column which should liven up the zine too.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Serendipity</b> is one of the few zines to feature colour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's used selectively, mainly on maps, where its use is very effective,
particularly for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1830 </i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Circus
Maximus</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The days of this zine winning
the Zine Poll are apparently gone but the skills that made this team so
successful have not deserted them - the only thing that has changed has been the
commitment to a rigorous production schedule, which has dropped from well above
average to about average for the hobby (i.e. reliable with occasional delays of
one or two weeks).<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>&nbsp; </b>(John

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0" align="left">Probably
the coolest 'zine around at the moment; the first twenty issues of its life were
as a subzine, so Mark is approaching the task with enthusiasm by the bucketful
at the moment. Lots of Diplomacy, as you might expect from one of the bigger
wheels on the tournament circuit, but Mark has introduced lots of fresh and
original ideas to the 'zine as well. Enthusiastic, witty and opinionated
writing; appropriate art; jolly subzines. About as different from <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">For

but similarly excellent in its own way. (Chris Dickson)</p>

the similar preoccupation with unusual deaths; it's also the broad variety of
games on offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course the
presentation is not as good as <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Backstabbers

the side of the page rather than the more convenient corner staple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The zine's appearance might be improved if one of the sub-zine editors
invested in a new typewriter ribbon but perhaps I just caught him on a bad
issue. Recommended if you want a wide variety of games with a bit
of humour thrown in and you don't mind the relaxed frequency. (John Harrington)</p>

there doesn’t appear to be a list open for players to join? Anyways, usually contains plenty of chat and discussion
about life’n’stuff, and John seems something of a recluse. To all intents

instantly appealing. Strange? Moi? (Alex Bardy)</p>
