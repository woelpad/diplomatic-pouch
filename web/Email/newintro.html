<h1>
A Newbie's Guide to Play By E-Mail Diplomacy</h1></center>

<h2 align="center">By Joe Brennan<br>(with generous help from Brandon Clarke)

<hr width="100%">

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
PBEM (Play By E-Mail) Diplomacy is a great game of intrigue, strategy, and
tactics. The rules are simple; the complexity comes from how you relate
to the other 6 players. This guide will be made up of two parts: Part A
will give you the basic knowledge you need to play and understand your
first game. If you are unfamiliar with the game, read it entirely before
starting a game. Part B will deepen your understanding - you can work through
this at your leisure. I wrote this guide before I finished my first PBEM
game, to help other newbies get underway. It is not exhaustive (on purpose).
If you want something exhaustive, try one of the other newbie guides. This
guide has the essentials.
<p align="center"><b><font color="red"><i>Note that this guide is for the

<a name="Getting Started"></a>Part A</h2>

<h3>
Getting Started</h3>
Diplomacy starts in 1901: pre-World War One Europe with seven players negotiating
with each other so that they can dominate the gameboard. Orders for fleets
and armies are secretly sent to the Judge (a computer), which then calculates
the results and forwards what has happened to the players. Then the players
go back to organising things for the next turn. Simple, right? The system
is, but the game is not. Will the Austrian help my French army to conquer
Munich? Will the German army in Kiel assist the Munich army? Can I get
Russia to attack Berlin from the east? Can I convince the German that I
am planning peaceful moves (preparing to attack Italy) and thus have the
element of surprise?
<p><b>Entering a game.</b>
</p><p>The first thing you need to do is enter a game. It might take a few
days for the game to begin, as you may have to wait for some other people
to enter. The game is likely to continue for months (or even longer); that's
because it takes a while for people to write the notes to each other, and
respond. You can put a lot of time into being a Diplomat, or a little;
it's up to you.
</p><p>To get into a game, click on the link below, and follow the instructions,
then use the BACK button on the top left of the screen to come back here.
</p><p>The link to the Pouch queue is: <a href="../DP-cgi/setqueue">http:/www.diplomatic-pouch.org/DP-cgi/setqueue</a>
</p><p>A Game Master will soon send you an e-mail, telling you that a game has
been set up, the codename of the game, and which judge (computer) will
run it. The GM is a wonderful person (of course) who is willing to give
you help and advice about how to get started and deal with the Judge. Don't
expect advice on strategy though; the GM generally won't give it. Now you
need to register with the judge.
</p><p><b>Your Options:</b>
</p><p>There are plenty of games that use e-mail but not computer Judges. There
are numerous Human Moderation groups on the web - one, CAT23 (see <a href="http://www.acronet.net/~mczet/">http://www.acronet.net/~mczet/</a>)
has thousands of active players and Game Masters. There's also an ICQ Diplomacy
Guild who play Diplomacy using ICQ and without a Judge involved. There's
also lots of web sites where you can input the orders directly into the
web site and play that way. But here, I'll show you how to use a Judge.
</p><p><b>Registering with a Judge.</b>
</p><p>Click on the site below, and you will be sent to a registration form.
Fill in the info, and click on the judge your game will be on. Among other
things, you will need to list your e-mail address, world time zone (you
may live on the other side of the world from where the game is being processed),
your phone number (again, if you're not in the US, you will need to provide
the judge with the full international number - mine was 14 digits long).
None of this is difficult, but it is necessary. List your site as an address
- don't put 'home', else you won't be able to play with anyone else who
has listed 'home' as their site!
</p><p>The judge will e-mail you right back, so give it a minute and then check
your mail. You'll be given a confirmation so that the judge knows you've
given it the right info. Don't forget to come back here afterwards!
</p><p>The link to the registration form is: <a href="registration.html">http:/www.diplomatic-pouch.org/Email/registration.html</a>
</p><p>Okay, you now need to tell the Judge which countries you would prefer
to play.
</p><p><b>Setting Country Preferences</b>
</p><p>If the GM told you the name of the Judge, but not its e-mail address,
you can find it at the registration form link: <a href="registration.html">http:/www.diplomatic-pouch.org/Email/registration.html</a>
</p><p>Let's imagine the game's codename is <i>blimp</i>. Let's also decide
on a password for ourselves: <i>croak</i>. This is what we might send:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><blockquote><tt>signon ?blimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>set preference AIFGERT</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
Every time you send an e-mail to the judge, you need to start with the 'signon'
command, and finish with the 'signoff' command.
<p>The question mark means you haven't been given a country yet, and the
preference letters refer to the countries we want to play, so we have just
asked the Judge to give us A (Austria), or if that's given to someone else,
I (Italy) etc. Chances are mighty slim that we'll be assigned Russia or
Turkey.
</p><p>You don't need to set preferences; if you don't, you will be given whichever
country nobody else wants.
</p><p>For more advanced options on setting preferences, click <a href="../DipPouchnewintro.html#Appendix A: Set Preference (Advanced">here</a>.
</p><h3>
<a name="Newbie Press"></a>Newbie Press</h3>
Press is easy to send, if you follow a simple format.
<ul>
<li>
You send an e-mail to the Judge.</li>

<li class="MsoNormal">
You 'signon' to the game and give your country and password. e.g. If the
game was called <i>speed</i>, you're playing Germany, and you make up a
password (<i>bloc3</i>) then you would write:</li>

<ul><tt>signon Gspeed bloc3</tt></ul>
Now the Judge knows who you are and what game you're playing.
<li>
You decide who you want to send the press to: one country or more.</li>

<ul>If you want to send a message to everybody, just write: <tt>broadcast</tt>.
<br>If you want to send a message to France, write:
<tt>press to F.</tt>
<br>If you want to send a message to France, Russia and Italy, write: <tt>press
to FRI</tt></ul>

<li>
Write the message.</li>

<li>
Write: <tt>endpress</tt></li>

<li>
Write: <tt>signoff</tt></li>
</ul>
Here are some examples:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table border="" cols="3" width="80%">
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top"><tt>signon gspeed bloc3</tt>
<br><tt>broadcast</tt>
<br><tt>I will destroy you all!</tt>
<br><tt>Endpress</tt>
<br><tt>Signoff</tt></td>

<td valign="top"><tt>signon gspeed bloc3</tt>
<br><tt>press to F</tt>
<br><tt>You will be first to be eliminated!</tt>
<br><tt>endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></td>

<td valign="top"><tt>signon gspeed bloc3</tt>
<br><tt>press to FRI</tt>
<br><tt>Let's all be friends. Is there really any reason why you should
all want to hurt my country?</tt>
<br><tt>Endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></center>

<!--
<p><b>Note:</b> Apparently some judges require you to use 'endbroadcast'
instead of 'endpress' when you finish a broadcast message (a message that
goes to every player). But 'endpress' works for every message with all
the judges I've played on so far....
-->
<h3>
<a name="Movement Options"></a>Movement Options</h3>
There are four options: move (attacking), support, hold and convoy.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
When you've decided what you want to do, send an e-mail to the Judge, signon,
write your moves, and signoff.</li>

<li>
Write whether the unit is an army or a fleet.  (This is optional, but good practice.)</li>

<li>
All the provinces are referred to by their first three letters, except
for the following:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>Gulf of Bothnia = gob or bot
<div class="MsoNormal">Gulf of Lyon = gol ot lyo
<br>Liverpool = lvp
<br>Livonia = lvn
<br>North Africa = naf
<br>North Atlantic Ocean = nat or nao
<br>North Sea = nth or nts
<br>Norwegian Sea = nrg or nwg
<br>Norway = nwy
<br>Tyrolia = tyr, tyl or tyo
<br>Tyrrhenian Sea = tys or tyn
<p>Don't try to remember all of this: print it out.</p></div>
</ul>
</ul>
The easiest way to learn how to use your units is to see it done in practice
e.g. You're playing England, and want to move towards Norway.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>Signon Espeed blob</tt>
<br><tt>A LVP-EDI</tt>
<br><tt>F EDI-NRG</tt>
<br><tt>F LON-NTH</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
You don't have to write A or F, but it helps to remind you which units
are fleets, and which are armies. In the next turn, you want your army
carried across the sea to Norway (a convoy):
<blockquote><tt>signon espeed blob</tt>
<br><tt>A EDI-NTH-NWY</tt>
<br><tt>F NTH C EDI-NWY</tt>
<br><tt>F NRG-BAR</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
That was a fall move, so now you have four Supply Centres but only three
units, so you decide to build a new fleet in Edinburgh:
<blockquote><tt>signon espeed blob</tt>
<br><tt>build F EDI</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
Heaven forbid that your country not grow, but if you have less SCs than
units, you must remove units of your choice. In the below example, Austria
chooses to remove its army in Budapest after a devastating Italian attack.
<blockquote><tt>signon Aspeed freddo</tt>
<br><tt>remove A BUD</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
In the next turn, you want to attack St Petersburg with your army, but
because Russia has a unit in there, you need your Barents Sea fleet to
support in the attack. You don't want to move your fleet in the North Sea,
but you want to move your new fleet into the Norwegian Sea:
<blockquote><tt>signon espeed blob</tt>
<br><tt>F BAR S A NWY-STP</tt>
<br><tt>F EDI-NRG</tt>
<br><tt>A NWY-STP</tt>
<br><tt>F NTH HOLD</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
In that turn, France invades England. You want your army back in a hurry.
You write:
<blockquote><tt>signon espeed blob</tt>
<br><tt>A STP-BAR-NRG-NTH-YOR</tt>
<br><tt>F BAR C A STP-YOR</tt>
<br><tt>F NRG C A STP-YOR</tt>
<br><tt>F NTH C A STP-YOR</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
<b>If you ever have to retreat a unit, you write it the same way you would
write a normal move.</b>
<p>
Note that St. Petersburg, Spain, and Bulgaria require special orders if you
wish to move a fleet into them. You need to write which coast the fleet is
moving into.  For example:
</p><blockquote><tt>F Mid-Spa(SC)<br>
F Con-Bul(EC)</tt></blockquote>
The first order puts a fleet on the south coast of Spain. A fleet there
cannot move to Gascony or affect any battle there.
The second order puts a fleet on the east coast of Bulgaria. A fleet there
cannot move to Greece or the Aegean Sea, nor affect any battles there.
<p>Supports are important to learn:
</p><ul>
<li>
You can support any attack, so long as your unit is next to the province
being attacked.</li>

<li>
You can support any unit that you think is about to be attacked, so long
as your supporting unit is next to the province, and the supported unit
in that province is not attempting to move</li>

<li>
An army can only support or attack a fleet in a coastal province. Likewise,
a fleet can only support or attack an army in a coastal province.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="Tutorial - Negotiating, Moving &amp; Stabbing"></a>Tutorial - Negotiating,
Moving &amp; Stabbing</h3>
You are offered a spot in a game called blimp. You decide to make your
password croak.
<p>You want to play as Austria, then Italy, then France, Germany, England,
Russia and Turkey, in that order. So you write an e-mail to the Judge:
</p><blockquote><tt>signon ?blimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>set preference AIFGERT</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
A few days later, everyone else has sent in their preferences, and you
are informed that you have been given Italy, your second preference.
<p>Now is a good time to look at the map. If you haven't got one, get one.
Here's a site: <a href="http://home.soneraplaza.nl/mw/prive/mkoning/diplomacy/diplomacy.html">http://home.soneraplaza.nl/mw/prive/mkoning/diplomacy/diplomacy.html</a>.
</p><p>You decide to immediately send press out to Austria, Germany and France.
You e-mail the judge:
</p><blockquote><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt> (we write Iblimp now because we
control I = Italy)
<br><tt>press to AGF</tt>
<br><tt>Hi, this is my first game. Anyone got advice for me?</tt>
<br><tt>endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
Sometimes its not smart to let everyone know you haven't got a clue! The
letters refer to the countries which will receive the mail, so Russia,
England and Turkey will not get this message unless someone else sends
it on to them.
<p>You also send the following press:
</p><blockquote><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt> (remember, it's not a lowercase
L, it's capital i for Italy)
<br><tt>press to F</tt>
<br><tt>Interested in attacking Germany? I am prepared to send an army
into Tyrolia to attack Munich the following turn, but I will need you to
support me. After taking Munich, I will support you in taking over Kiel
and Berlin.</tt>
<br><tt>endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt>
<p><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>press to G</tt>
<br><tt>Let's be friends.</tt>
<br><tt>endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt>
</p><p><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt> (blimp is the name of the game, croak is
my password)
<br><tt>press to A</tt>
<br><tt>If you promise not to attack Venice, I will stay out of Trieste.
I intend to hit Germany with France. Perhaps you would like to join in?</tt>
<br><tt>endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt>
</p><p><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt> (always remember to endpress <u>and</u>
signoff when finished)
<br><tt>press to T</tt>
<br><tt>I will do whatever it takes to avoid Austrian domination of the
Balkans. Together we could find a better way of governing the area, don't
you think?</tt>
<br><tt>endpress</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></p></blockquote>
After a while, you get e-mail from each of these countries, all in agreement.
(That doesn't always happen.) You decide to enter moves. You send an e-mail
to the Judge:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>A Ven-Tyr</tt>
<br><tt>A Rom-Ven</tt>
<br><tt>F Nap-Ion</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt>
<p>(you don't write endpress because you haven't written any press - just
orders)</p></blockquote>
A=army, F=fleet (You don't have to write A or F at the start of each order,
but it will help you to be organised.) The army in Venice moves to Tyrolia,
the army in Rome moves to Venice, the fleet in Naples moves into Ionian
Sea.
<p>This is a little dangerous. If the army in Vienna or Munich also attempts
to move into Tyrolia, nobody gets it, and your army would have to return
to Venice. Also, your army in Rome would then be unable to enter Venice,
and thus return to Rome. Two of our moves would not work. The fleet is
moving towards Tunis, as this is a supply centre, and controlling it in
a fall move would mean you can build another fleet or army in Italy at
the end of the Fall move.
</p><p>The Judge sends you an e-mail detailing how everyone has moved. The German
army in Munich attempted to enter Burgundy at the same time as the French
army at Paris, so neither of them got it. Austria, however, has sent all
its units south. The time for a stab into Austrian supply centres (SCs)
has come!
</p><p>You send press to Austria detailing how you are going to send your forces
north against Germany, affirm your alliance with France, but send a message
to Turkey asking for an invasion of Greece - this will stop the Austrian
fleet from getting that SC.
</p><p>You then e-mail the judge:
</p><blockquote><tt>signon Iblimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>A Tyr-Vie</tt>
<br><tt>A Ven-Tri</tt>
<br><tt>F Ion-Tun</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
The next day the judge informs you that your dreams have become reality!
All your plans have come to fruition, and you now have six supply centres.
A dream start for Italy, a nightmare for Austria.
<p>You now have a basic understanding of the game, and could begin one
with some confidence. Feel free to copy any of this onto your word processor
for future reference. Come back when you're ready to read Part B for more
information about PBEM Diplomacy, which will give you a deeper understanding
of the game.

<h3>
<a name="Player Rankings"></a>Player Rankings</h3>
If you would like to find out if any of your opponents have finished games
in the past, check out this site: <a href="Ratings/YARS/">http:/www.diplomatic-pouch.org/Email/Ratings/YARS/</a>
<p>But the easiest way to find out how much a person has played is to send
a mail to the Judge, and ask it to LIST the game. Next to each player will
be a number - his/her dedication rating. Now you can see if some grizzled
veteran is in your game, and you can join together with the other players
and squish him. (He shouldn't be playing in a newbie game, after all.)
Remember that a player could have a lot of experience but a small dedication
if they have quit games in the past. If you don't check both, you can't
be sure. There's no need to check this, but you may want to.
</p><h3>
<a name="Abbreviations and Jargon"></a>Abbreviations and Jargon</h3>
I won't claim this is everything, but it will get you started:
<p><b>DMZ </b>= de-militarized zone (no one moves a unit into a DMZ by
agreement)
<br><b>BTW </b>= by the way
<br><b>FTR </b>=for the record
<br><b>:-) </b>=a smile
<br><b>;-) </b>=a wink and a smile
<br><b>:-( </b>=a frown
<br><b>DIAS </b>= Draw Includes All Survivors - all the surviving players
have to agree to a draw, and all the survivors participate in the draw.
(You cannot vote a surviving player out of the draw.)
<br><b>NoDIAS= </b>If all of the surviving players agree to resolve the
game the same way, the game ends with the agreed result. Players could
agree to let any combination of survivors (even just one) win the game.
<br><b>SCs</b> = Supply Centres
<br><b>stab</b> = attacking someone who didn't expect it, you told them
you wouldn't...
<br><b>Judge</b> = a computer which organises the game you're playing
<br><b>JK</b> = Judge Keeper: the person who looks after the Judge
<br><b>GM</b> = Game Master, the person who oversees the game, can fix
any mistakes
<br><b>Gunboat</b> = a game in which you may not communicate with each
other
<br><b>Gulf of Bothnia</b> = gob or bot
<br><b>Gulf of Lyon</b> = gol ot lyo
<br><b>Liverpool</b> = lvp
<br><b>Livonia</b> = lvn
<br><b>North Africa</b> = naf
<br><b>North Atlantic Ocean</b> = nat or nao
<br><b>North Sea</b> = nth or nts
<br><b>Norwegian Sea</b> = nrg or nwg
<br><b>Norway</b> = nwy
<br><b>Tyrolia</b> = tyr, tyl or tyo
<br><b>Tyrrhenian Sea</b> = tys or tyn
</p><h3>
<a name="More Press Options"></a>More Press Options</h3>
There are all sorts of press options not used in newbie games. My favourite
is called grey press, whereby you send press which does not identify the
sender. Fake press (also called black press) is when you are allowed to
send press as though you are another player (this is so chaotic few people
play such games).
<br>To find out more about these, look at Tim Miller's Guide: <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/andyhre/main.html">http://home.pacbell.net/andyhre/main.html</a>

<h3>
<a name="Appendix A: Set Preference (Advanced"></a>Appendix A: Set Preference
(Advanced Option)</h3>
Say you really want to play England, but just hate playing France. Then
you would do:
<blockquote><tt>signon ?blimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>set preference E[GIART]F</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
The square brackets tell the judge that all the countries in the brackets
are equal; they're not in any special order. So if you really wanted to
play an Eastern European country, but don't care which, you could write:
<blockquote><tt>signon ?blimp croak</tt>
<br><tt>set preference [IATR]FGE</tt>
<br><tt>signoff</tt></blockquote>
