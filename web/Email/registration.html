<h1 align=center>Judge Registration Form</h1>
<p>
Use this form to register as a potential player with any of
the Internet Diplomacy judges.  There is no charge for registering or
playing.  No salesman will call.  Nobody will add you to any junk mail list.
There are no strings at all.  This is the way the whole world should work.
<P>

<b><font color=red> Warning: <i>All</i> information submitted must be correct, including your name, address, phone number and e-mail (if you want to lie about your age, that's okay). If you want to withhold some information, please feel free to only put your city and state, or put xxxx on the last part of your phone number. Any information you put here will be available to members of the Diplomacy community. That being said, fake information is becoming a headache to judgekeepers and some of them are considering a policy of deleting bogus registrations without warning. The registration databases are not used for any sort of marketing purposes and they are not given or sold to anyone. Valid registrations are required for playing Diplomacy via the judges. </b></font>
