<b><font color="red"><u>DPjudge vs. Ken Lowe judge:</u></font>
On the <a href="../../dpjudge">DPjudge</a>, the 1898 variant starts in Winter of 1898, with
no units on the board and every power eligible for one build.  The
build can be placed in any of the power's home centers, after which
that center is the one and only center that the power owns.  Play then
continues after these free builds with Spring 1899 Movement.
<p>
Because the capability to allow an initial free build to determine the
initially owned center could not be implemented on the Ken Lowe judges,
the initial owned center and unit are fixed as described below.

In the 1898 variant the game starts in Spring of 1899 with each power
having one unit.  Each country must capture its other home centers
before it can build in them.  The initial setup is:

  Austria - Army Trieste
  England - Fleet Edinburgh
  France  - Army Brest
  Germany - Army Kiel
  Italy   - Army Naples
  Russia  - Army St. Petersburg
  Turkey  - Army Smyrna
  
The victory conditions remain 18 centers.
