The chaos variant is played by 34 players, each owning a single supply
center on the standard Diplomacy map.  The game starts in Winter of
1900 at the adjustment phase.  Each player starts out choosing which
type of unit they wish to build and progressing from there.  When
building units, a unit may be built at any owned supply center.

Due to the number of players, power names are a single character
followed by the three letter abbreviation of your initial center.
These are:

     A-Ank, B-Bel, C-Ber, D-Bre, E-Bud, F-Bul, G-Con,
     H-Den, I-Edi, J-Gre, K-Hol, L-Kie, N-Lvp, P-Lon,
     Q-Mar, R-Mos, S-Mun, T-Nap, U-Nor, V-Par, W-Por,
     X-Rom, Y-Rum, Z-Ser, 0-Sev, 1-Smy, 2-Spa, 3-StP,
     4-Swe, 5-Tri, 6-Tun, 7-Ven, 8-Vie, 9-War.

thus if you were assigned Serbia in game &quot;fontenoy&quot;, you would sign on
to the game as &quot;signon zfontenoy <password>&quot;.  Before powers are
assigned you would continue to use the ?fontenoy syntax for a signon.
Note that O and M are not used because they are reserved for Observer
and Master, respectively.

Victory conditions are 18 supply centers.
