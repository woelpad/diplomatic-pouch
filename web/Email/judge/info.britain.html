In the Great Britain variant each English province is a supply center
and England starts with six armies.  Thus, England is the &quot;strongest&quot;
country, but can't do anything until another player agrees to convoy
one of his armies (or he is forced to debuild one of his units and
then builds a fleet after retaking the supply center).

The victory conditions are 19 centers.
