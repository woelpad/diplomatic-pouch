<a name="DIAS">Automated</a> drawing is a fairly new addition to the Diplomacy Adjudicator. It
is facilitated with two commands:<samp> SET [NO]DIAS </samp>and<samp> SET [NO]DRAW</samp>.
<p>
The term &quot;DIAS&quot; means &quot;Draws Include All Survivors&quot;. In a game designated
as DIAS, a surviving player cannot be excluded from a draw. In a NoDIAS
game, a surviving player may give up his right to be included in a draw.
In either case, unanimous approval of surviving players is required for
a draw to be passed.
<p>
By default, all games are DIAS. The moderator can change this with the
<samp> SET NODIAS </samp>or<samp> SET DIAS </samp>commands.
<p>
<a name="Algorithm">In</a> a DIAS game, a player may cast his vote for a draw by issuing the command
<samp>SET DRAW</samp>. He may veto earlier approval by issuing the command<samp> SET NODRAW</samp>.
If at any time all surviving players accede to a DIAS draw, the game will
be immediately terminated, and all participants in the game will be
informed of the result.
<p>
The situation for NoDIAS games is a bit more complex. To vote for a NoDIAS
draw, a player issues the command<samp> SET DRAW </samp><i>[drawlist]</i>, where <i>[drawlist]</i>
is a list of the identifiers for the powers he wishes included in the
draw. When a player gives approval to <i>[drawlist]</i> and <i>[drawlist]</i> includes
his own power, he is also implicitly approving any subset of <i>[drawlist]</i>
that also includes his power. On the other hand, when a player gives
approval to <i>[drawlist]</i> and <i>[drawlist]</i> does <strong>not</strong> include his own
power, he
is implicitly approving any subset of <i>[drawlist]</i>, <strong>and</strong> any subset of
<i>[drawlist]</i> including his own power.
<p>
For example, if Austria issued the command<samp> SET DRAW AEG</samp>, he is approving the
draws AEG, AG, AE, or A. Note that by including himself in his draw list,
he is assuring that he cannot be excluded from a draw. If Austria issued
the command<samp> SET DRAW FT</samp>, he is approving FT, F, T, AFT, AF, AT, or A.
<p>
If, under these rules, more than one draw is approved by all players, the
draw including the most players passes.
<p>
In a NoDIAS game,<samp> SET NODRAW </samp>is equivalent to the command<samp> SET DRAW </samp>
<i>x</i>, where
<i>x</i> is the power issuing the command. This means that the player will only
accept a concession to himself.
<p>
Here are a few examples of the draw mechanism in action. The players listed
are assumed to be the only survivors.
<p>
    France:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    England:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    Austria:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    Results in a three-way draw between Austria, England, and France.
<p>
    France:<samp> SET DRAW AE</samp> <br>
    England:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    Austria:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    Results in a three-way draw between Austria, England, and France.
<p>
    France:<samp> SET DRAW AE</samp> <br>
    England:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    Austria:<samp> SET DRAW AE</samp> <br>
    Results in a two-way draw between Austria and England.
<p>
    France:<samp> SET DRAW AEF</samp> <br>
    England:<samp> SET DRAW AE</samp> <br>
    Austria:<samp> SET DRAW AE</samp> <br>
    This game does not end in a draw.
<p>
    France:<samp> SET DRAW A</samp> <br>
    England:<samp> SET DRAW A</samp> <br>
    Austria:<samp> SET NODRAW</samp> <br>
    Results in a concession to Austria.
<p>
Any draw vote, DIAS or NoDIAS, is good for one phase only. All draw votes are cleared at
the end of a phase. A drawn game may be restarted with the<samp> RESUME </samp>command.
<p>
Questions or comments about the draw system may be directed (for now) to its
programmer, Jonathan Haas, at <i>positron@eecs.umich.edu.</i>
