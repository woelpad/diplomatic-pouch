You can receive a copy of this file via E-mail by sending your local Judge a message with &quot;get info&quot; in the body.
<p>

<p>
To communicate with the Diplomacy Adjudicator you should send it a mail
message in the following format:
<p>
<dl>
    <samp>
<dd>SIGNON <i>pxxxx password
 <dd>   commands</i>
</samp>
</dl>
<p>
Where <samp><i>p</i></samp> is the identifier of the power you have been assigned and
<samp><i>xxxx</i></samp> is the name of the game you are participating in.  The power
identifier is usually the first letter of the power unless there are
conflicts in which case it might be the second letter.  For example in
the Youngstown variant, India's identifier is &quot;N&quot; since Italy uses &quot;I&quot;.
<p>
<a name="Signon">To</a> enter a game that is forming, use:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>    <samp>SIGNON ? <i>password    </i> </samp>          To enter the next available game
<dt>or 
<dd><samp> SIGNON ?<i>xxxx password</i> [<i>variant</i>] </samp>Specifying the name of the game you want
<dt>or
<dd>  <samp>CREATE ?<i>xxxx password</i> [<i>variant</i>] </samp>To create a new game and sign on
<dt>or
<dd> <samp> SIGNON %<i>xxxx password      </i>     </samp>To sign on as an alternate standby
<dt>or
<dd> <samp> OBSERVE <i>xxxx password    </i>      </samp> To just get the reports for a game
</dl>
<p>
your password will be set to the password you specify.  Note that if you
use the third form above, other players wishing to enter that game will
have to use the second form.  Before you can sign on to a game, you must
register with the adjudicator.  See the information about the<samp> 
<a href="#Register">REGISTER</a> </samp>command near the end of this text.
<p>
<a name="Preference">Immediately</a> after the initial signon you should specify your preference
of what powers you would like to be assigned with the command:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>    <samp>SET PREFERENCE <i>list</i></samp>
</dl>
<p>
where the <i>list</i> is a sequence of the power identifier letters.  To give 
a set of powers equal weighting, enclose them in parenthesis or square
brackets.  Thus:<samp> <i>set preference f</i>[<i>ergti</i>]<i>a</i> </samp>would indicate that you 
really want France and really don't want Austria, but you don't care 
about which of the others you are assigned if you can't have France.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Takeover">To</a> take over a power that has become abandoned, you merely sign on with:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>    <samp>    SIGNON <i>pxxxx password </i>[<i>variant</i>]</samp>
</dl>
<p>
where <samp><i>p</i></samp> is the identifier of the power you are attempting to take over.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Resign">Other</a> commands that you can put after the <samp>SIGNON</samp> command are:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>    <samp>    SET PASSWORD <i>new_password</i></samp>     To change your password
<dd>    <samp>    SET ADDRESS  [<i>reply_address</i>] </samp> To change where your reports go
 <dd>    <samp>   SET ACCESS   <i>same,any-site  </i></samp>  To change what users can sign on
<dd>    <samp>    SET LEVEL    <i>novice,advanced </i></samp> To restrict to a particular class
<dd>    <samp>    SET VARIANT  <i>variant    </i></samp>      To change the variant before starting
<dd>    <samp>    SET <i>phase    parameters    </i></samp>   To change the deadline calculation
<dd>    <samp>    PHASE <i>season year phase    </i></samp>   To specify future orders
<dd>    <samp>    CLEAR        </samp>                 To clear pending orders
<dd>    <samp>    RESIGN       </samp>                 To withdraw from the game
 <dd>    <samp>   SIGNOFF      </samp>                 To indicate the end of useful text
<dd>    <samp>    LIST            </samp>              To get a status of the game
<dd>    <samp>    BROADCAST [<i>options</i>]    </samp>       To send rest of mail as press message.
 <dd>    <samp>   PRESS [<i>options</i>]      </samp>         Ditto.  Use &quot;get press&quot; for options.
 <dd>    <samp>   TERMINATE          </samp>           To declare the game over
 <dd>    <samp>   RESUME          </samp>              To restart a completed or terminated game
 <dd>    <samp>   WHOIS<i> user         </i></samp>           To list information about a player
<dd>    or  diplomacy orders.

<a name="Get">The</a> following commands can be sent to the adjudicator with or without a
signon command:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>
    VERSION [<i>level</i>]   To see the current version and enhancements since level.<br>
    REGISTER ... END  To register yourself (see below).<br>
    IAMALSO <i>address</i>   To register a new email address (see below).<br>
    LIST [<i>game</i>]       To get the status of the specified game or all games.<br>
    HELP              To get this text (no other commands will be processed).<br>
    MAP <i>game 	</i>      To get a postscript map of the game status.<br>
    GET <i> file  </i>       To get a particular file.  The available files are:
<p>
      info:     This text.<br>
      <a href="index.html">index</a>:
		An alphabetical summary of all commands.<br>
    % <a href="syntax.html">syntax</a>:

      info.xxx: Additional information for nonstandard variant xxx.<br>
      map:      The province abbreviations and connections (cryptic).<br>
      map.xxx:  The same for nonstandard variant xxx.<br>
      master:

      flist:    
		A list of all files available with sizes.
<p>
</dl>
The files marked with % above are &quot;must&quot; reading before you can really
get started (the percent is a marker refering you to this footnote, don't
include it in the GET command).  In addition to the standard variant, 
supported nonstandard variants are:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>
    Youngstown:  A fairly common variant including Asia.<br>
    Loeb9:       Danny Loeb's 9 player variant including Spain and Norway.<br>
    Pure:        Each power starts with one army on a map of seven provinces.<br>
    Chaos:       A 34 player variant in which each player gets one center.<br>
    Britain:     England starts with six armies.<br>
    1898:        Each player starts with only one of his home centers.<br>
    Crowded:     Eleven players occupy all 35 centers at game start.<br>
    Machiavelli: Uses money to support units and/or bribe others' units.<br>
    Fleet_Rome:  Italy starts with a fleet rather than an army in Rome.<br>
    Gunboat:     The identities of the other players are kept secret.<br>
</dl>
<p>
Be sure to read the info file for these variants before signing on.  The
Machiavelli variant is more complex than standard Diplomacy and has its
own rules file &quot;rules.machiavelli&quot; which you must read before playing as 
well.  There are PostScript maps available for some of the variants:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>
    map.ps:         The standard variant and many others.<br>
    youngstown.ps:  Youngstown variant.<br>
    loeb9.ps:       Loeb9 variant.<br>
    machiavelli.ps  Machiavelli variant.<br>
</dl>
<p>
These files are fairly large.  They are also available via anonymous ftp
to ftp.u.washington.edu under the names 'public/misc/xxxx.ps'.  It is 
preferred that you get them via anonymous ftp if you can.
<p>
To sign on to a nonstandard variant before it starts or to take over a
power in a nonstandard variant you must specify the variant name on the
signon command.  This is to ensure that you know what you're getting
yourself into.  If anyone would like to see the judge support other
variants, please send your suggestions to the judge-request address as
listed below.

<a name="Register">When</a> involved in a game of Diplomacy it is best if all the players in the
game are unique.  Puppet powers tend to spoil the game for the other
players.  Some games are designated as &quot;all players from different
sites&quot; or &quot;all players from the same site&quot; to keep the balance from
becoming too badly tipped if contact between two players is too easy or
too hard.  It is important for the judge to know who you are in order
to determine if you are right for a particular game.  Please fill out
the following registration form by replacing the example text after the
colons with proper information and return it to the judge.  Name, phone
and site are required.  You should also list at least one email address
that won't change.

You can query the database of people by sending a<samp> WHOIS <i>user</i> </samp>request
to the judge or you can get the entire database with<samp> get whois</samp>.  You
may update this information at any time by sending in a new registration 
form.  Note that you can use the information returned by the whois
command as a template by throwing a<samp> REGISTER </samp>line in front, an<samp> END </samp>line
on the end, changing the other information and sending it back to the
judge.  Please try to spell your site name the same way other players
may have spelled it.  Feel free to add additional information by making
up your own keywords, but keep it under half a page.
<p>
The judge recognizes you by the return address in electronic mail that
you send in.  If you use multiple accounts, you can tell the judge that
another return address should be considered the same person by sending
an<samp> IAMALSO <i>address</i> </samp>command from the new account, where<samp> <i>address</i> </samp>is
one of the electronic mail addresses that you listed on your Email line
when you last registered.

Signing onto another player's power without his permission is a serious
offense.  Punishable by being staked out in the hot sun with red ants
placed in your ears and nostrils.  Although Diplomacy is based on treachery
and lying, this falls under the category of &quot;spoofing the games master&quot;
which is not allowed.  If another player accidently sends you his password, 
you are required by honor to report this to the player and not take
advantage of it.  By signing onto the other player's power, the judge
will send you a copy of his submitted orders, but the other player will
get a copy of this message and an alarm message will also be sent to
the judge's administrator.
<p>
Thank you for your cooperation.
