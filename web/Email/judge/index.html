<p>
This is an alphabetical list of all the commands that the adjudicator will
process with a brief description.  Each command is preceded by a <i>who</i>/<i>where</i>
pair.  This indicates <i>who</i> can execute the command and <i>where</i> the command
can appear.  The <i>who</i> options are:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>any:  Anyone can execute the command.
<dd>mod:  Only the moderator in moderated games, anyone in unmoderated games.
<dd>adm:  Only the administrator.  These commands are listed to be complete,
      but should <strong>not</strong> be executed by nonadministrators.  If there is any
      doubt, you are not an administrator.
</dl>
<p>
The <i>where</i> options are:
<p>
<dl>
<dd>any:  Can appear either before or after a signon command.
<dd>pre:  Must appear before a signon command.
<dd>aft:  Can only appear after a signon command.
<dd>mac:  Can only appear after a signon to a Machiavelli variant game.
</dl>
<p>
Items in square brackets are optional, items in<samp> UPPERCASE </samp>are keywords
and must be entered exactly as specified, items in<samp><i> lowercase italics </i></samp>are
parameters and should have an appropriate value substituted in.  Words
separated by vertical bars (|) indicate a choice of one of the words.

<p>
<dt>mod/aft<samp> BECOME <i>power</i></samp>
<dd>        Allows the master for a game to assume the identity of a particular

<p>
<a name="Clear"><dt>any/aft<samp> CLEAR</samp></a>
 <dd>       To clear any pending orders entered with the<samp> <a href="#Phase">PHASE</a> </samp>command.
<p>
<dt>adm/pre<samp> FIXID <i>siteid site_name</i></samp>
<dd>        Sets all players who have registered with the specified site name
        to have a siteid as indicated.  By default all users get their
        area code times 100 as a siteid and must be fixed to some non-
        even multiple of 100.
<p>
<dt><a name="Get">any/any<samp> GET <i>file</i></samp></a>
 <dd>       To get a particular file.  For a complete list of files see file
        <a href="flist.html">flist</a>.  See file <a href="info.html">info</a> for a description of the more important
        files.
<p>
<dt>any/any<samp> GET DEDICATION</samp>
 <dd>       To determine the user's current dedication rating.
<p>
<dt>any/any<samp> GET PACKAGE</samp>
 <dd>       To get the &quot;new user <a href="package.html">package</a>&quot; of files.  These files are generally
        sent automatically to new users at the time they register with a
        Judge (see<samp> <a href="#Register">REGISTER</a> </samp>command), but they can be specifically requested
        with this command.  These files are the ones that all new users
        should read before attempting any Judge Diplomacy games.
<p>
<dt>any/pre<samp> HELP</samp>
<dd>        The general introduction text file is returned.  This is equivalent to
        the<samp> <a href="#Get">GET INFO</a> </samp>command except that no other commands after the help 
        command will be processed.   
<p>
<dt>any/aft<samp> HELP</samp>
 <dd>       Equivalent to <samp> <a href="#Get">GET INFO</a></samp>.
<p>
<dt>any/any<samp> HISTORY [<i>game</i>] [FROM <i>date</i>] [TO <i>date</i>] [LINES <i>n</i>]</samp>
<dd>        Retrieves the history information for the specified game for the
	time specified time period (in real time rather than game time).
	The history information is all the messages that an observer would 
	have seen had he been signed on for the time period.  The default
	period is 1 week ago to the present or 1000 lines whichever comes
	first.
<p>
	Dates can be specified in the following forms (only spaces should
	be used to separate parts of a date, except a comma is optionally
	allowed after the day of the month):
<dl>
<dd>	    a)  Day of week (three-letter abbreviation)
<dd>	    b)  Day and month (three-letter abbreviation), or month and day
<dd>	    c)  Day, month, and year, or month, day, and year, where year
		can be specified either as 80-99 (= 1980-1999) or four
		digits.
</dl>
	Also, a time in hours and minutes (i.e., 'hh:mm' form, using a
	24-hour clock) can be added after any of the above if desired;
	otherwise, the time defaults to midnight (00:00) of the specified
	day.
<p>
	To get the earliest part of the history (or the whole history), use
	a date that is known to be earlier than the game start date; 1 Jan
	1990 (or Jan 1, 1990) is usually sufficient for this purpose.
<p>
<dt>any/any<samp> IAMALSO <i>address</i></samp>
 <dd>       To register a new email address.  If your return address changes
        you can use the<samp> IAMALSO <i>address</i> </samp>command to tell the adjudicator that you
        are the same person without having to resubmit a complete form.
        The address specified must be one that was registered previously.
<p>
<dt>any/pre<samp> LIST [FULL|<i>name</i>]</samp>
 <dd>       If no optional name or keyword is specified a short list of the
        current games is generated.  If the<samp> FULL </samp>keyword is specified
        a detailed report including the player list of each game is
        generated.  If a name is specified, the full report for that game
        is generated along with unit positions and supply center holdings.
<p>
<dt>any/aft<samp> LIST</samp>
 <dd>       The detailed report of all players and units will be generated
        for the currently signed on game.
<p>
<dt>any/pre<samp> MAP <i>name</i> [<i>n</i>]</samp>
<dd>        Send a postscript map of the current status of the game. Not all
        variants are supported. The <i>n</i> option sends the file in plain
        postscript format instead of uuencoded, compressed ps format.
	(This command may be disabled.)
<p>
<dt>any/pre<samp> MAP * [<i>n</i>]</samp>
<dd>	This command must prefix a LIST output from any judge and will
	produce a map based on that output. The &quot;*&quot; is real and is not
	replaced. The <i>n</i> option is as above.
	The <samp>LIST</samp> output supplied must <strong>not</strong> have any characters added to
	the beginning of the line. e.g: The comment (&quot;&gt;&quot;) character.
	(This command may be disabled)
  <p>      
<dt>adm/pre<samp> NOCONTROL</samp>
<dd>        Prevents broadcast message from actually being sent.  For debugging.
<p>
<dt><a name="Observe">any/pre<samp> OBSERVE <i>xxxx password</i> </samp></a>

<p>
<dt><a name="Phase">any/aft<samp> PHASE <i>season year phase</i></samp></a>
  <dd>      To specify that any following orders should be held until the
        specified phase before processing. See the 
		<a href="syntax.html#Conditional">Conditional Orders</a> and 
		<a href="syntax.html#Phase">Submitting Orders for Future Phases</a>

<p>
<dt>any/aft<samp> PRESS <i>options</i> ... [ENDBROADCAST|ENDPRESS|SIGNOFF]</samp>
 <dd>       To send a press message; options must be specified, and the message
        may be terminated by<samp> ENDBROADCAST</samp>,<samp> ENDPRESS</samp>,<samp> SIGNOFF</samp>, or the
        end of the (incoming) mail message.  See file <a href="press.html">press</a>.
<p>
<dt><a name="Register">any/any<samp> REGISTER ... END</samp></a>
<dd>        To register yourself.  See file <a href="form.html">form</a>.
<p>
<dt><a name="Resign">any/aft<samp> RESIGN</samp></a>
<dd>        To withdraw from the game.  This must be the <strong>last</strong> command in the
        message to be effective; so if you want to broadcast a farewell
        message, do so before you enter the<samp> RESIGN </samp>command.
<p>
<dt>mod/aft<samp> RESUME</samp>
<dd>        To restart a completed or terminated game
<p>
<dt>mod/aft<samp> ROLLBACK <i>turn</i></samp>

<p>
<dt>any/any<samp> SEND [ME] <i>file</i></samp>
 <dd>       Equivalent to<samp> <a href="#Get">GET <i>file</i></a></samp>.
<p>
<a name="Set"><dt>mod/aft<samp> SET ACCESS ANY[-SITE]|SAME[-SITE]|DIFFERENT[-SITE]</samp></a>
  <dd>      To change what users can sign on.  By default only people from
        different sites can sign onto a game.
<p>
<dt>any/aft<samp> SET ADDRESS  [<i>reply_address</i>]  </samp>
 <dd>       To change where your reports go.  If you don't specify an address
        the address from the mail headers will be used.  If you signon and
        your the address in the mail headers does not match the reporting
        address you will get two replies, one to each address.  This can
        be fixed by using<samp> SET ADDRESS </samp>with no reply address specified.
<p>
<dt><a name="SetAll">mod/aft<samp> SET ALL PRESS</samp></a>
<dd>	To request that all partial press be sent to you as the moderator
