<p>
Here we go!  Things the players in this tournament should do:
<p>
<h3>As GM (one game each):</h3>
<p>
First:  if you'd like to have a "shadow GM" to master the game with
you and help out with some of the sticky situations, you'll want to
ask for one before getting started.  There's a mailing list on
Yahoogroups.com (the same server as "vtgroup") called "NewDipGM";
join it and ask for a shadow GM there.  We're going to have a bunch
of experienced GM's who will be volunteering to help out.  It'll
also be a good place to ask general questions about Mastering and
learn more about the trade.
<p>
After receiving information from David Norman about which
game to GM, who to invite to the game, and which powers they should
play, each GM will create his game as described below.
<p>
If you haven't (or if you've somehow deleted this message),
email <a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">David</a> and ask him to
send you another copy.
<p>
Use the script below to create the game.  Note that the games are
gunboat, no-press, NoProxy, NoList, and Quiet.  At the end of each game,
the identity of all seven players will become known.  Towards the end of
the year, GM's will be asked to switch their games to NoReveal to
minimize the chance for meta-gaming.
<P>
Choose a judge to host your game.  Almost any Judge will do, but please
stay away from language-specific Judges like DEAC and non-traditional
Judges like USDP.  Good choices for Judges include USVG, USIN, FROG, USTR, SEPO, DEDO, USTX, NZMB,
and USEF (as long as they're not at their
limit for games and closed to new games being formed).
Oh, and don't pick USVG or USIN if Dave Kleiman
is a player in your game and don't pick USTX if Greg Greenman is a
player in your game -- they're the Judge Keepers for those judges and
can't play a game on them.  USCH is closing down, so don't form a game
on it.
Also, pay attention to the table below
and try to spread the games evenly across the Judges.  Tell me
(<a href="mailto:masseyd@btv.ibm.com">Doug Massey</a>)
where the game is being hosted, so I can help keep track of these things.

</table></center>
<p>After you've created the game using the script below, contact each of your seven players, PRIVATELY and SEPARATELY, to
tell them which Judge is hosting the game.  This is important -- for the
2002 tournament, the games are truly gunboat.  No player will know who
the other six in his game are, so you *can't* just send out an email to
all seven at once.  Email the separately and privately.
<p>
You shouldn't need to tell them
which power to sign on as; they also received an email with that
information from David Norman.  It doesn't hurt to remind them, though.  :-)
After all seven players have signed
and the game has formed, signon as master and list the game to ensure
that everyone is the power that they're supposed to be.  Set the deadline
for the first move to the starting date of the game with the command
'set deadline 8 mar 2002' (or whatever date is needed).
<p>After everyone has signed on, you might want to collect home
phone numbers for the seven players -- this will help you get in
touch with them if they are unexpectedly disconnected from the
Internet.  It's optional for both you and the players, but it's in
their best interests as well -- it helps protect their position in
the tournament should something go wrong.
<p>Keep a record of the game (at the very least, all the adjudications).
That way, if the judge crashes, we can recreate the game quickly,
without much hassle.  Grant any reasonable (two weeks or less) extension
request, since some players may not be available 100% of the time
(who is?).  If you have any questions about GM'ing, send "get master"
to the judge to get a good description of the various GM commands,
and feel free to ask anyone in the tournament for help -- most of us
have GM'ed a game before and know the ropes.
<p>
We'll be using the EP House Rules, including the three-year draw clock:
<p>
"The GM reserves the right to terminate a game in a draw involving
all of the remaining powers if it is clear that the position on the
board has reached a stalemate. (Determined by no changes to province
ownership for the last three game-years.) The GM must announce their
decision to start the three game-year clock one season prior to doing
so.  If a player objects to the termination and can convince the GM
that there is still play in the game then the game will continue."
<p>
A "change to province ownership" means that one power occupies a province
(SC, non-SC land space, or sea space) that was last occupied by another
power.
<p>
Please note that the Draw Clock should not be used to force a game to end. It should be
used to terminate a game which should already be over but for an obstinate
player.  You should use the draw clock if the only player to object is a player
who thinks the game is not over because somebody else should make the first
move to break the stalemate.
<p>
In general, the Draw Clock is not there to make games shorter. It is there
to stop people using the tactic "Do this or I won't ever set draw and the
game will never end".  If you have any questions, ask
<a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">David</a> before bringing
up the subject with your players.  He understands the rule -- and the
tournament format -- and should be able to help you out in that regard.
<p>
This is
the creation script -- be sure to change the gamename and password!
Just cut and paste it to the body of an email to the Judge of your choice,
change the gamename and password, and the game will be created with you
installed as the Master.  Easy, huh?  The reply from the Judge might
make you think that you've signed on as a power, but this script promotes
you to Master -- test it out by trying to signon as "m" afterwards.

This game is one of 137 no-press games in a seven-games-per-player first
round of the 2002 Vermont Group No-Press tournament.  Each of the
137 players in the tournament play seven games (one as each power) and
master one more.  The scoring system is 7/N-1 points for winners or drawers,
(ie, 6 for a win, 2.5 for a 2WD, 1.33 for a 3WD, etc.), -1 points for
losers/survivors.  Best total over seven games wins the tournament!

=========== end create ===========
</pre>
<p>
At the end of the game, the master should signon and
<p>
<ol>
<li>order the command "summary" to get the end-game summary with all
the player's names and save that file, just in case the Judge crashes
at some point in the future and the game is deleted.
<li>order the command "set white", which will allow the players to
submit End-Of-Game statements.
<li>send out a broadcast to all the players, in which you congratulate
the winner or the participants in the draw and encourage the players
to submit EOG's.
</ol>
<p>

<h3>As player (seven games):</h3>
<p>
Soon, you will receive information from David Norman about which
games you are going to join and which power you'll play in each game.
If you haven't (or if you've somehow deleted this message),
email <a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">David</a> and ask him to
send you another copy.

<p>
When your GM tells you where your game is being hosted, signon and
set your preference to the power that David Norman stated you
are going to play, like so:
<p>
signon ?vgnp2*** **password** gunboat<br>
set preference *
<p>(naturally, you put in the proper numbers for '**' in the gamename,
the proper power letter for '*' in the preference, and substitute your
own password for '**password**').
<p>
We ask that everyone sign onto games as soon as possible -- the S1901M
deadline is moved out to the appropriate time, so the game doesn't have
to start earlier than its scheduled time (however, if all seven players
want to submit orders, they may do so and get a head start!).
<p>
If you get confused about who you are in which game, ask your GM.  If he
doesn't remember,
<a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">David Norman</a> has
all the information you need; drop him an email.
<p>
This is no-press, so submit your moves, every turn, as quickly as
humanly possible.  No one should ever have to set wait -- once you
get the results back from the judge, make your map, think for five
minutes, and send your orders back to the judge.  With Alain's mapping
web site, you can accomplish this from any web browser you have at
your disposal.  Check the judge's
echo of your moves so you can keep an eye open for errors.  24-hour
games should move at a year-per-week rate, especially if the players
are reliable -- and you ALL are.
<p>
Ask for extensions in a timely manner, don't resign from your
positions, and most of all HAVE FUN.
<p>
<h3>Doug, one of my players has gone abandoned.  What should I do?</h3>
First, figure out who the person is (I assume you've done
this).  Second, email him directly -- not by press through the Judge --
and ask him if he's having trouble.  I go so far as to ask for home
phone numbers so I can get in touch if there are severe email problems.
If that fails, email <a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">David Norman</a>,
and ask him to help determine if the player is missing in his other
six games. Some of these
will be finished; others will be on-going For the ones that are
still being played, you can signon as an observer and 'press to m', asking
if (a) the player is still alive in that game, and if so (b) if he's
been holding the game up.
<p>
If the player is abandoned everywhere, we'll replace him.  Email me
with the bad news and I'll contact the list of subs to find a
replacement.
<p>
If he's
present in other games and still playing, have *those* GM's press
directly to him -- he might have changed email addresses, screwed
it up in your game but not the other games, and not even realize that he's
missing.  You can't contact him because you don't know his real
address.  If he's still playing Diplomacy, this method should be
sufficient to track him down.
<p>
<h3>General Information</h3>
It's nearly the same format as last year.  Each player will play each power
once and GM one game.  Placement will such that your 42 opponents, 7 GM's,
and the seven players in the game that you GM will all be unique and
random.  Games will START between JANUARY 11 and MARCH 29 -- we'll spread
them out more or less evenly.  If you've never GM'ed a game before, this
is the perfect time to learn.  All seven of your players will likely be
able to help you with any question you might have.

<p>
If you have not GMed before, and are a really worried about doing so even
with such experienced players, then we can provide a shadow-GM for you.
You still do all the work, but the shadow-GM will be able to see what you
are doing, and give you a hand if he sees you heading towards
difficulties.

<p>
Games will be no-press, gunboat (anonymous), and Quiet.  Unlike previous
years, though, the games will *not* be NoReveal.  You won't know who
you are playing against in any game, but as soon as it's finished, you'll
find out who played which power.  Quiet means that any missed deadline
warnings will not specify the powers involved.

<p>
<pre>
*********************************************************************
** This is a departure from the previous tournaments.  The games   **
** will *not* be NoReveal.  They'll be regular, anonymous, gunboat **
** games where the players are revealed in the end.  The exception **
** is that the last 15 games or so will be switched to NoReveal    **
** before they complete, in order to keep people guessing about    **
** which players are playing which powers in the last few games.   **
*********************************************************************
</pre>

<p>
Points will be awarded by the JDPR standard:  7/N points for each game
won or drawn, minus 1 point for each game played.  A leaderboard will
be maintained that shows the current points for each player and the
number of games completed.  The last 15 games or so will be switched
to NoReveal in December 2002, so that any leaderboard knowledge won't
serve to help the remaining players.  The champion will be crowned as
soon as the final game finishes.

<p>
The Vermont Group is about reliability from a resignation standpoint,
rather than getting-your-moves-in-on-time standpoint; however, VG
games generally do better than average in this regard.  Most players
are veterans and have healthy "dedication" levels on the Judges.  As
such, I've decided that the games will have 23-hr weekday deadlines,
with long (95 hour) grace periods.  It's not expected that everyone
will meet *every* deadline, but players should do their best to do so.
No-press games don't require *that* much time to determine moves,
since there's no communication involved.  There will be a web site for
the Tournament that has links to the maps of all the games that will
ease each player's ability to make his moves on time, even from remote
locations.  This site will have the status of all the on-going games
and links to the maps provided by Alain's wonderful service at
http://floc.net .

<p>
A typical game will, as a result, likely see lots of missed deadlines,
but still step forward at a reasonable pace.  In the Vermont Group,
24-hour games average seven days per game-year; 48-hour games average
ten days per game-year.  The 2001 tournament games all started
during the first three months of the year and 116 of 124 have completed
as of December 5, 2001 (with the 7 of the other 8 in the endgame).

<p>
Missing deadlines hurts your "dedication" points, but few of you
should have any problem with that, since most veterans have long
since piled up large numbers.
<p>

Remember, you are from a group of players who are hand-picked for
your reliability, so making assumptions about this tournament based
on others in which you have played would be hazardous.  I fully
expect this tournament to build upon the success of the 2001 version,
which was the biggest and (certainly in my mind) best no-press
tournament the Internet has ever seen.  By count of games, this will
be the largest Diplomacy in the history of the game, for any medium
or format.
<p>

The only method of cross-gaming I can determine would be a player who
sees, late in the tournament, that he needs to go for a win rather than a
draw in order to pass a player on the leaderboard.  It's a minor flaw,
but one I'm willing to live with in order to have a leaderboard that will
serve to maintain interest through the year or more that it will take to
run the tournament.  By switching the last few games to NoReveal, such a
player won't be able to pick out a tournament leader in his game with
much certainty (in order to attack him when he might not otherwise), so
the best way to win the tournament is to play better than everyone else.
Simple, huh?  :-)
<p>

Summary:  Seven no-press Standard games per player, starts spaced
out over about thre months, plus one game as a GM.  23hr weekday
deadlines with 95hr grace.  Gunboat, NoList, Quiet, DIAS, NoProxy,
and NoNMR set.  The last 15-20 games will be switched to NoReveal
as the tournament winds down.  Final results revealed after last
game is completed.
