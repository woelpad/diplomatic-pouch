<BR>How to Check the Calculation of a Rating
</H2>

First, you need the
<a href="http://devel.diplom.org/Email/Ratings/JDPR/data.zip">data</a>.
This file is big -- 1.3M, which will unzip out to 6.5M or so.  The
file contains line after line of the raw data needed to calculate
JDPR ratings.  The format will look like this:

<p>
The Strength line is just the weighted average of the players in the game.
If you divide by 500, raise e to that power, and multiply by 7 (or the
number of powers in the variant), you'd get the sum of strengths mentioned
in the <a href="describe.html">JDPR description</a>.  I use it to easily
determine which games had the most competitive field and also, when this
value goes too high or too low, to detect a problem with my code.
<p>The main data has ten columns.  They are:
<ol>
<li>ID number for the player -- unique for each *person*, but the same
for all the email addresses and Judges used by that person, in all the games
played by that person.
<li>Player Name, as listed in the JDPR big list of
<a href="players.html">players and ratings</a>.  All the aliases a player
uses are thus combined into a single name.  In the example above, the
names have been changed to protect the innocent.
<li>Power controlled by the player -- for Standard Diplomacy, 1 = Austria,
2 = England, etc.
<li>The gamename and the judge.
<li>The press value.  1 means broadcasts and partial press, 0.8 means
broadcast only, 0.5 means no press, and 0.3 is real-time Diplomacy.  This
is "P" in the calculation.
<li>Pro-rate value for the player.  This is the percentage of time that
a player spent at the helm of his power.  1 means the whole game,
obviously.  "Sum of strengths" is prorated by time played and uses
these numbers.
<li>Share for the player.  If the power ends up being a win or a draw,
then the people that played it will share the benefit according to time
played and this number will equal the pro-rate value.  But if it's a
loss, only the original player gets the damage (his share is 1, the
subsequent replacement(s) get a 0).  Deltas to player ratings are
determined using this number.
<li>Points.  It's 7/N, for standard games, where N is the number of
winner/drawers in the game.  If there's more than one player for a power,
the points are pro-rated by time played, of course.  This is "S" in the
calculation.
<li>Initial rating.  Divide by 500, and raise e (2.718281828) to that power
to get the number that's really important, the number that describes the
player's ability in comparison to average, and to those in the game.  It's
used to determine the "Sum of strengths" for the game (pro-rated by the
pro-rate value for the player, given in column 6), and the "X" in the
equation (which is pro-rated by the share value for the player, given in
column 7).
<li>Final rating.  This is the result of the calculation based on the
the JDPR calculations for this game.
<li>Games played by the player, before this one -- this is "E" in the
JDPR calculations.  This only counts games
that have an effect on his rating.  If a player had seven or more games
coming into this one, he's considered "fully-rated".  The percentage of
fully-rated players in a game (pro-rated by time played, of course), is
"R" in the calculation.
<li>The variant value.  This is between zero and one, and indicates the
significance of the variant played upon the players' ratings.  Standard
Diplomacy is 1.0, other variants might have lower values if the victory
condition is less than (SC+2)/2, or if the ratio of SC's to powers playing
the game is very small.  In general, both of these factors introduce more
luck into the game and make the game less relevant for determining a
player's rating.  This number is "A" in the calculation, and together
with "P" and "R", are used to calculate the "value" of a game.
</ol>
<p>Let's take the data in this example and show how the new ratings were
calculated:
<pre>
This was a Standard game, broadcast and partial press, since the press
and variant values are both 1 (actually, there are a number of variants
that also get a value of 1, but it makes no difference from the standpoint
of the ratings).  Since both the pro-rates and the values add up to seven,
it's a seven player game.  You can also tell that it was an EGR draw:
the first player had a pro-rate of 1 and got 0 points, so he lost as
Austria; the next player had a pro-rate of 1 and got 2.33, he shared in
a 3-way as England; the next player lost as France; the next two shared
Germany (the first for a third of the game, the second for two-thirds) and
also got a 3-way, obviously; the next two shared a loss as Italy; the
next two shared a 3-way result as Russia; and the last four took turns
losing as Turkey.  Austria1, England1, France1, Italy1, Turkey3, and
Turkey4 were all "fully-rated", so the ratio of fully rated players is
(1+1+1+0.33+0.44+0.41)/7 = 0.60.

A = 1.0
P = 1.0
R = 1 + 0.60 = 1.60
V = 7.5 * A * P * R = 12.0

Pro-rated Sum of Strengths = 76.37
E = 1 + 40 / (10 + Games)
X = 7 * Share * Player-strength / Sum of Strengths, for each player
Delta = E*V*(S-X) for each player

        Rating  Games   Stren.  E       X       S       Delta   New Rating
Austria1 1037   21      7.96    2.29    0.73    0       -20     1017

</pre>
<p>A few things to note about this game.  The players, in general, are
much better than average (as the game strength of 1195 indicates).  As
a result, the players with ratings around 1000 (Austria1, Italy1, and
Turkey1, for example), weren't expected to get a full 1.0 points as their
expected value.  The better players (England1, France1) were expected to
get more than 1.0 points.  The system is devised to be fairly stable,
in that the positive deltas to players' ratings should about balance out
the negative ones.  This game is a bit strange in that regard, though,
as it hands out an extra 59 points.  That's because some of the players
that drove up the game's Sum of Strengths (Turkey4, in particular)
didn't factor into the distribution of the deltas, since he was a
replacement player for a losing power.  Also, the winners were all
relatively inexperienced and thus had large E values, whereas the losers
were more experienced and had smaller E values.  Strange indeed.
<p>With this example and the
<a href="describe.html">JDPR description</a>, you should be able to
figure out why your rating did what it did in a particular game.
<p>The database allows you to do two neat things:  you can recall any
particular game by searching for "gamename.JUDG", and you can track the
record over time of any one player by searching for the player name
(or by using "grep", if you're into UNIX).  Armed with that, you can
track the peaks and valleys of your rating and see if your general
trend is one of improvement.
