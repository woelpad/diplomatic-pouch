<h3>The Diplomacy Resignation Record</h3>

Last update: January 1, 2001
<p>
<b>New!</b>A<a href="http://www.onesite.org/dip/Queryform.php3">query tool</a>
that you can use to search for your DRR rating.  Thanks, Alain Tesio!
(Note, though, that this data isn't always using the most recent database
-- check the last-update date in both places)
<p>
The list itself is right
<a href="http://devel.diplom.org/Email/Ratings/JDPR/players.html">HERE</a>.  It's
kinda big (1.71 Mb).
Five numbers are given for each player:  A unique ID number, the Judge Diplomacy Player Rating,
JDPR games played, Diplomacy Resignation Record games played, and resignations
from DRR games.  The games played totals overlap for the most part, except
that (a) games older than three years old can't be counted in the DRR and
(b) games with certain Irregular flag settings aren't counted in the JDPR.
Many players have aliases -- multiple name/email combinations that
are used by the same person -- I <b>highly encourage</b> everyone to check this
list and help me combine multiple email addresses under single entries.
If you see two entries for the same person, email me,
<a href="mailto:masseyd@btv.ibm.com">Doug Massey</a>, with the information.
<p>
Visit the Diplomatic Pouch for more information on the
<a href="http://devel.igo.org/DipPouch/Email/Ratings/JDPR/jdpr.html">Judge Diplomacy Player Ratings</a>.
<p>
I encourage the use of
this list as a tool to help GM's determine which players are likely
to be reliable (that is, likely to play his or her power until the
completion of the game or that power's elimination).  The goal is for all
public games
on the Diplomacy Email Judges to be entered automatically into the database that
produces this list; so far, only some judges report game finishes
automatically (USIN, USVG, USEF, DEAC, USCA, FROG, USBR, CAMA, USCH, and USTR), while other judges
(USPA, USWI, CAWA, and SEPO)
are polled manually for finished games.  This polling is not guaranteed
to catch every game and *cannot* catch *any* NoList game.
<p>
Here's how Resignations and Completed Games are counted.
<p>
Completed Game:  Any game where you are the last person to play
a power in the game.
<p>
Resignation:  Any game where you play a power, but are not the last
person to play that power.  Exceptions:  you can't be penalized for
RTDip games, NMR games, terminated games, or other various irregular
type games (as defined at the JDPR).  Also, in the case of a temporary
replacement (defined as player A being replaced by a series of one or
more players before coming back to play that power again), the
original power is only counted once and none of the replacement
players count at all.  So if the summary looked like this:
<P><pre>
  Germany:       Player A
   from F1902M:  Player B
   from F1904M:  Player C
   from F1906M:  Player A
   from F1908M:  Player D
  Italy:         Player E
   from F1903M:  Player F
   from F1905M:  Player G
   from F1907M:  Player F
  Russia:        Player H
   from S1904M:  Player I
   from F1909M:  Player J
</pre>
<p>then the players records would be affected as such:
<p>
Players A, E, H, and I each pick up one game and one resignation (G++, R++)<br>
Players D, F, and J each pick up one completed game (G++)<br>
Players B, C, and G don't change at all.<br>
<p>
A private enclave called
<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~masseyd/vermont.html">The Vermont Group</a>
has been formed as
an organization of games for dedicated Diplomacy Players.  These games
are available only to members of the Group.  To join, you must have
a ratio of (G-R)/(R+1) greater than 4.0, where G = games played and
R = resignations, as indicated in this Resignation Record.
If you find your name on the list linked below and your ratio is higher
than 4.0, then you are eligible to join the Vermont Group by emailing
<a href="mailto:masseyd@btv.ibm.com">me</a> or by requesting to be
included in a Vermont Group game at the
<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~masseyd/vermont.html">web site</a>.
Please contact <a href="mailto:masseyd@btv.ibm.com">me</a> for details
or any questions you might have.
<p>
I've gone back to including all Resignation Records, not just those players
who have completed
at least TWO games.  Also, here's a
<a href="./rrgames.html">list of games</a>
which are included in the Resignation Record database, but *not* the JDPR
database (because I don't know who won the game, only who played!).

If you have record of a game completed within the last three years
that isn't included, please feel free to send it to me (see the
