<p>
<b>New!</b>A <a href="http://www.floc.net/observer.py?page=search_form_jdpr_people">query tool</a>
that you can use to search for your JDPR rating.  Thanks, Alain Tesio!
(Note, though, that this data isn't always using the most recent database
-- check the last-update date in both places)
<p>
For some time now, I've been trying to gather up all the available
information about the ten years of Diplomacy on the Judges and put
together a comprehensive archive of all the players, all the games,
all the variants, and all the results that have ever seen play on
all the Judges throughout history.  Collecting the data is a considerable
task; figuring out what to do with that data is nearly as difficult.
<p>
However, I've finished my first attempt and would like to enlist
the Diplomacy community to help me (a) complete the database and (b)
check the database for errors.  The plan is to provide all the data
listed below; if there's a link there, that means the data is available.
If there's no link, then I haven't gotten to it yet.
<p>
<!--
Here's a graph that shows how JDPR ratings are distributed through
the Judge hobby, as of January 1, 2001.  I used two data groups:
all 9691 players who've completed at least one JDPR-rated game and
the 1424 players who have at least
*seven* JDPR-rated games under their belt.
<p>
For all players, the mean
JDPR is 1000.17, the median is 966.04, and the standard deviation
is 111.57.  Note in the chart below that there's a spike at 950 (for
those who just played one game, lost, and left the hobby).  Otherwise,
it's a pretty smooth bell curve.
<p>
For the experienced players, it's more of a bell curve that stretched
a bit to the right.  I think this is a human feature:  good players
tend to stay around longer and push their ratings higher, whereas
poor players might leave the hobby before their ratings bottom out
(remember that JDPR's shift over time, moving towards some theoretical
"true" value as the player finishes more and more games).  The mean
is 1038.77, the median is 996.55, and the SD is 201.63.

A list of all <a href="games.html">9830 games (~704Kb)</a>
in the database, along with the Judge name, date of completion,
result, and variant type.  Included with each game are
"Irregular Flags", which indicate strange game settings or occurences
during the game which affect whether or not the game is eligible for
Hall of Fame points.  If you have a game summary for a game that
isn't on this list, please email it to me, <a href="mailto:masseyd@btv.ibm.com">Doug Massey</a>.
<p>
A list of all <a href="players.html">14619 players (~2.7Mb)</a> on the Judges.
Five numbers are given for each player:  A unique ID number, the Judge Diplomacy Player Rating,
JDPR games played, Diplomacy Resignation Record games played, and resignations
from DRR games.  The games played totals overlap for the most part, except
that (a) games older than three years old can't be counted in the DRR and
(b) games with certain Irregular flag settings aren't counted in the JDPR.
Many players have aliases -- multiple name/email combinations that
are used by the same person -- I <b>highly encourage</b> everyone to check this
list and help me combine multiple email addresses under single entries.
If you see two entries for the same person, email me,
<a href="mailto:masseyd@btv.ibm.com">Doug Massey</a>, with the information.
Every time a correction is made and the ratings are recalculated, the
entire system becomes more accurate (since opponents' ratings factor into
the calculations).  The best way I can think of to do this is to load
the player list into your browser, then scan for names and email addresses
that you've used.
<p>If you found your rating and can't imagine how it could have
possibly ended up there and would like to determine exactly what mistake
I made in the calculation of your rating, I'm extremely eager for you
to do so.  I try to make random checks to make sure my programs are
working right, but there are lots of players and lots of games.  This
page will explain <a href="howto.html">how to check</a> the calculation
of your rating.
<p>
The JDPR Ratings are based on Tony Nichols and George Heintzelman's EIDRaS
system.  Rather than compile the points earned for wins and draws
(a system that obviously favors the prolific player), an EIDRaS system
gives each player a rating that factors in variant type, press settings,
opposition strength, and past performance.  An in-depth <a href="describe.html">description</a>
of the system is included for your scrutiny and constructive criticism.
<p>
Using this system, I've compiled various rankings.  To qualify
for listing in any of the rankings, a player must have seven games of
that type.
