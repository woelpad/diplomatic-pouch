<H1>Judge Diplomacy Player Ratings -- Description</H1>

The Judge Diplomacy Player Ratings is based on Tony Nichols and George
Heintzelman's EIDRaS system.  Rather than compile the points earned for
wins and draws (a system that obviously favors the prolific player), the
JDPR system gives each player a rating that factors in variant type,
press settings, opposition strength, and past performance.
<p>
When a game is completed and its summary is sent to the Archive database,
the necessary information is extracted to adjust the PbEM Rankings
of all the players, according to the results of the game.  There are
several factors which determine how much each player's rating goes up
or down, if at all.  Each player begins his Diplomacy life with a rating
of 1000, which represents that of an average player.
<p>
At its most basic level, the movement of a player's rating is based on
four numbers: the number of raw points he won in the game (S), the number
of points he was expected to take from that game (X), his past experience
(E), and the "value" of the game (V). His rating goes up by E * V * (S - X),
If he won no points, then this value will be negative and
his rating will go down.
<p>
S is the easiest number to calculate.  If the game has M players to start,
then the winner would get M points.  If it's an N-way draw, then each member
of the draw gets M/N points.  Easy enough.
<p>
X is more complicated, because it depends on how strong a player was and
how strong his opponents were.  At the beginning of the game, each player
has a rating Ri, where i = 1..M (there are M powers in the game, and we'll
assume there are no replacements to deal with).  The strength of the
game is just the sum of the strength of all its players, which is measured
e ^ (Ri / 500).  Since the average player (and all new players) has a
rating of 1000, the average player strength is e^2, or 7.39, and the
average strength of a standard game is 7 times this, or 51.7 (if you'd like
to calculate the average rating of a player in the game, divide the game
strength by the number of powers -- 7, for standard Diplomacy -- then take
the natural log and multiply by 500) .  A single player's expected score
for a game is just their ratio of the total strength of the game; ie,
X = M * [e ^ (R / 500)] / sum[e ^ (Ri / 500)].  The graph below shows
how X varies with JDPR in a standard Diplomacy game  -- "average opponents"
means that the other six players have JDPR's of 1000).

<p>
So if the ratings for
seven players in a standard game are 800, 900, 1000, 1000, 1100, 1200,
and 1500, then their strengths would be 4.95, 6.05, 7.39, 7.39, 9.03,
11.02, and 20.09, the game's strength would be 65.92, and their expected
scores would be 0.53, 0.64, 0.78, 0.78, 0.96, 1.17, and 2.14 -- which adds
up to 7.00, the number of points awarded in a standard game.  The average
rating is 500 * ln (65.92 / 7), or 1121.  It's not an arithmetic mean,
but rather a sort of exponential average, which is more appropriate for
this system, which is based heavily on exponential math.
<p>
The "value" of the game, V, is the term that allows us to compare games
of different variants, different press types, and different deadline
lengths in a single Diplomacy rating.  The larger V is, the more the
outcome of the game will effect a player's rating -- positively or
negatively.
<p>
V is just 7.5 * A * P * R, where A is the adjustment due to the variant,
P is the adjustment due to press, and R is the adjustment due to the ratio
of "fully rated players" in the game.
<p>
A is [s * w * 14] / [(s+2) * M * 34], where s is the supply center
count for the variant, w is the number of centers required for the win,
and M is the number of powers in the variant.  Note that for the standard
game (s=34, w=18, and M=7), A is exactly 1.0.  The maximum value A can
take for the purposes of calculating V is also 1.0.  Note also that this
equation simplifies down to A = 0.412 * s * w / [(s+2) * M].
<p>
P is 1.0 for a game with partial press of any kind.  If only broadcasts
are allowed, then P = 0.8.  If no press is used at all, the value is 0.5.
If the game is Real Time Diplomacy, then P = 0.3, regardless of the
press settings.
<p>
R is (1 + f/M), where f is the number of M powers who have completed
at least seven games in the Archive database that were used in the
JDPR system, and are thus fully rated (for the definition of "fully rated",
see the description of E, below).  So R ranged between 1.0 (a game with
no fully rated players), to 2.0 (a game with seven fully rated players).
<p>
E, a player's experience, is determined solely by the number of games, G,
in the Archive database that were used in the JDPR rating system which
had an effect on the player's rating.  Any irregular games that don't
count toward the calcualtion of JDPR, as well as any mercy positions
that the player assumed, aren't counted towards G for a player. If the
number is greater than 7, then he's "fully rated" (as mentioned in the
description of R, above).  Also, E = 1 + [40 / (10+G)], where G is the
number of games.  If G is zero (ie, the player is new to Judge Diplomacy),
then E is 5.0 and any adjustment to his beginning rating is multiplied by
the maximum, 5.0.  As he plays more games, E starts to get smaller and
smaller.  After he's played 30 games, E is only 2.0, and the adjustments
to his ranking are less severe (one would assume that his ranking is a
pretty accurate indication of his ability by this time).  After 90 games,
E is only 1.4; it eventually converges to 1.0.
<p>
This all seems overly complicated, but I have a computer do all the
number crunching, of course.  All I need as inputs are the initial
ratings and games played for each player, the variant type and press
settings for the game, and the result.  Here's an example:
<p>
<pre>
Standard game, W--- press, 3-way AET draw:

A = 0.8
P = 1.0
R = 1 + 4/7 = 1.57
V = 7.5 * A * P * R = 9.42

Game strength = sum of strengths = 65.92
Delta = E*V*(S-X)

        Rating  Games   Stren.  E       X       S       Delta   New Rating
Austria 800     11      4.95    2.90    0.53    2.33    +49     849
England 900     4       6.05    3.86    0.64    2.33    +61     961
France  1000    0       7.39    5.00    0.78    0       -37     963
Germany 1000    12      7.39    2.82    0.78    0       -21     979
Italy   1100    3       9.03    4.08    0.96    0       -37     1063
Russia  1200    9       11.02   3.11    1.17    0       -34     1166
Turkey  1500    26      20.09   2.11    2.14    2.33    +4      1504
