			using the YARS system (created by Bruce Duewer) and calculating all
			games entered into this
			system after their completion.  Under this system, each player who
			begins a game contributes one point from his rating to make up the
			game "pool."
			This seven-point pool (or a portion of it) is awarded to the victor
			or drawing players as follows:
			<ul>
			<li>For a solo victor:  7 points
			<li>For each power in a two-way draw:  3 points
			<li>For each power in a three-way draw: 
				1<img align=top src=../tiny_2.gif>/<font size=-2>3</font> points
			<li>For each power in a four-way draw:  1 point (break-even)
			<li>For each power in a five-way draw:  0.6 points
			<li>For each power in a six-way draw:
				<img align=top src=../tiny_1.gif>/<font size=-2>3</font> point
			<li>For each power in a seven-way draw:
				<img align=top src=../tiny_1.gif>/<font size=-2>7</font> point
			<li>For each eliminated power: 0 points
			</ul>
			<p align=justify>
			Notice that seven points go into the "pool," but (except in the
			case of a solo victory), fewer than seven come out of it.  The
			number of points that come out -- and are then distributed to the
			drawing powers in equal shares -- is one point greater than the
			number of players <i>not</i> sharing in the draw.
			<p align=justify>
			Note also that replacement players <i>never</i> put up a one point
			<i>ante</i>.  This is done <i>only</i> by the first player to play
			a power in the game.  If a power is abandoned and then eliminated,
			<i>only</i> the player who <i>first</i> played the power is
			penalized (by losing his full one-point <i>ante</i>).
			<P align=justify>
			If a power is abandoned and later wins or shares in a draw
			under a replacement player, the points earned by that power are
			shared among <i>all</i> persons who played the power, pro-rated by
			the number of movement phases played by each
			(the original player loses the full ante, of course).
			However, no replacement player may earn more than any person who
			would have played the power from gamestart to completion.
