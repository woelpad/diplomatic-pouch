<h3>Guide to using the Record and submitting info to the Record</h3>

<p>
This list contains the resignation records of all Judge Diplomacy player
who have finished at leave five game in the last three years.  The data it
tabulates:  number of games played, number of times replaced, name,
and email.  The Hall of Fame document by Nick Fitzpatrick is a good
starting place to find some information about potential players, but
isn't updated often enough (last time: September of '96).  The
Diplomacy Resignation Record has less information, but is much more
recent.

<p>
This record may be helpful to the subset of GM's who wish to run a
game free from abandonments and desertions.  Advertise your game and
state a minimum requirement for reliability (for instance, five
completed games for every abandonment) and then check prospective
players on the Resignation Record.  Feel free to reference the Record
itself in your advertisement for the game.

<p>
Note that some resignations are completely excusable, but that this
Record doesn't try to distinguish them.  A player may have a perfectly
reasonable explanation for a less-than-stellar resignation record.  It
is up to the individual GM's, of course, to decide who they should
have in their games.

<p>
The Resignation Record isn't meant to be a blacklist that tries to exclude
people from playing Diplomacy.  It's a centralization of publically
available information that's meant to be used as a tool for GM's who
want to create Judge games that will have reliable, stick-to-the-end
players.  Some people like games where the original seven players
stay throughout the game; this list is for those people.
<p>
To submit data to the list, request a summary of the game from the
judge and send it me.  Keep in mind that
NMR games (those which boot players who are late with moves) and Real-
Time Diplomacy games aren't included in the database.  Other variants,
games with reduced victory conditions, all press variations, unmoderated
games, and most other irregular games ARE included.
<p>
All summaries will be added to the database for the JDPR.

<p>
Here are some statistics and suggestions about how one could use the
data in the Resignation Record:

<p>
As of Oct 6, 1998, there are 5464 players on the list, who have played
19809 positions with 6189 resignations/abandonments.  That's 31%, which
I find rather depressing.

<p>
That means a typical, standard Diplomacy game can expect three players
to leave the game before they've been eliminated.  I sure this comes
as no surprise to players who've had any experience with PbEM Diplomacy
and knows that waiting around for a replacement for an England that's
down to two centers is all part of the game.

<p>
The average player has been in three games, leaving one of them before
completion.

<p>
I use a simple formula to use this data to screen potential players to
games I GM:  (G-R)/(R+1), where G is games played and R is resignations.
The average value is 1.46, although the median value is 1.00 (three
games, one resignation).  Values associated with selected percentile
ranks:

<p>
<pre>
99th:           15.0
98th:           10.0
95th:            5.2
90th:            3.0
80th:            2.0
50th:            1.0
35th and below:  0.0
</pre>
<p>
So if you insist on a Resignation Record standing of 3.0 or above, you
can limit your game to the upper 10% of reliable players on the Judges.
There are actually 705 people in this category, although not all are
still active in the hobby.  The admission to the Vermont Group requires
a ratio of greater than 4.0; this demarcates a group of 381 Diplomacy
players, of which about a third have joined the Group.
<p>
Hope this helps,
