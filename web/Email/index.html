Welcome to everything you wanted to know about playing Diplomacy
via E-Mail!  This section of the Diplomatic Pouch currently contains a
list of resources which can help you get involved or more involved
in the Play-by-E-Mail hobby.
<!--
<p>
In the future, this section of The Pouch will hopefully be
populated by a constantly updated look at the PBEM world.  Plans for this
section include a regular feature on the status of the Internet <i>judge</i>
software,
its updates and improvements.  Here, you'll also be able to view a map for
any game on any judge, see a list of game openings, join a game, and even
send press and issue your orders from interfaces to be installed here.  The
Pouch itself may eventually keep track for you of which games you are playing.
You'll just tell this section who you are when you visit, and be guided
through the latest developments in your games.
Grand plans, yes (so don't start holding your breath), but stay tuned
as the E-Mail Diplomacy section of The Diplomatic Pouch slowly fulfills this
ambitious charter.
<P>
For now, until this section matures as outlined above, here are the resources
you need to begin or continue play in the e-mail Diplomacy hobby.  Enjoy!
